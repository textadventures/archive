They will need to buy 1kg and 2kg bags of potatoes to create this weight, add in the weight of the shopping bag, and probably nibble on a potato to reduce to the exact right weight.\r\n\r\nI've got my bags of potatoes set up with weight attributes, but how do I then put the potatoes in a shopping bag and weigh the shopping bag to show the total weight?\r\n\r\nLikewise, when the player nibbles at a potato, how to reduce the potato's weight?\r\n\r\nThank you!! This forum has been SO HELPFUL.",
