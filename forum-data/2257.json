I can think of ways to do it Using flags but there must be a more elegant solution... some kind of string??\n\nThe game has several linked scenarios.\n\nEach scenario has between 7 -10 rooms.\n\nwhen a player enters the scenario the game needs to randomly place objects (from a 'storage' room for that scenario) in the scenario rooms. It could be done all at once or it could be done as a player explores (taking a number of objects from the storage room each time)\n\nEg if playing cluedo the rooms would be Kitchen, Billiard Room, Study etc. The objects would be Miss scarlet, Colonel Mustard, the gun, the rope etc\n\nSo when the player steps into the hallway all the objects (say 12) are placed randomly in the 9 rooms.\n\nSo...can this be done? can the no. of  objects be greater than the number of rooms? Or can the number of rooms be greater than the number of objects? can i specify some rooms having 2 objects and others just 1? Do all the objects have to be placed? Can i then get Character objects (suspects) to move between rooms but objects like the gun to stay still?\n\nmany thanks in advance for any suggestions",

Say rooms and objects for scenario one might have a property called 'scenario' set to 1.  You can then run a 'for-each' over all the objects in your scenario 1 storage room and randomly allocate the objects to other rooms with a matching scenario property.  You could tweak this quite easily so that some (random) items are not placed at all should you wish to.\n\nI'd also use a boolean property (called 'mobile') for objects you want to move around the rooms, you can then use an 'afterturn' script to move just those objects that have the 'mobile' property set.  If you dig through the archives of this board you'll find some very old code of mine which has a cat that wanders around a house (respecting doorways, not to do so is a mistake, I'll explain why if you wish) The code is out of date, but the principle behind it is still valid.\n\nBest of luck\n\nAl\n\na.k.a. &quot;MaDbRiT&quot;",
