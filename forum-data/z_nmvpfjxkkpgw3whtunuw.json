      "EditableText": "I prefer to type commands. But sometimes it can be convenient to have the links there, in case you've worked out what to do but there's a lot of different ways it could be phrased. For example, there's one game I've been working on which allows all kinds of variations of \"wedge lever\", \"jam lever\", \"put rock in lever\", \"use rock on lever\", or similar things. I'm remaking a classic (early '80s) text adventure, and on the original the only acceptable invocation was \"wedge lever\". I figure that some people will prefer having a menu to choose from so they don't have to guess the right word; and some might prefer to type commands (in which case I do my best to make the game understand as many synonyms as I can think of so that you're not struggling to guess the words once you solved the puzzle.\r\n\r\nDifferent tastes :)",
