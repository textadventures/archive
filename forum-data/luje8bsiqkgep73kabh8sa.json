Also, I made little animations and drew illustrations but I'm not that great of an artist XD.\r\nThe Rainbow Deal is basically a fantasy adventure about the search of a young creature trying to save his little brother. I wanted to create an interactive story with real choices and consequences and no cheap game-overs. \r\n\r\nIf you like cute Pokemon-like creatures but also a serious story and character developement give this one a try! I'd be very happy for any feedback, especially constructive criticism. (I mean it, if you could help me improve everyone would profit, right?)\r\n\r\nI've currently only completed the first chapter but it is already a pretty long game. I'll continue it regardless of popularity though because I really enjoyed writing it :-)\r\n\r\nHave a nice week everyone!\r\n",
