I was hoping for a little guidance for a newbie.\n\nThe game I'd like to create would have two characters working together as partners to solve puzzles. I want the player to be able to play as either one of these characters and be free to switch back and forth between Character A and Character B. Character A would have different printed texts when looking at or trying to pick up various objects in the environment than Character B has. (E.g., Mary looks at a TV and the text prints 'I love this show,' Bob looks at the same TV and text prints 'This show is terrible.') Furthermore, both Characters A and B will follow one another as they move from room to room, solving puzzles.\n\nMy question is, what's the easiest way to go about accomplishing this? (I am not yet experienced enough to work with 'deeper' stuff like writing the code by hand from scratch.)\n\nThank you so much,\n\n-Heather\n\nEDIT: I should note my current plan as it stands is to make a Character A and B object for every single room (Character A #1, #2, #3, etc.) and then create a global custom Command 'switch to character B' and then a huge list of &quot;If player is object [characterA#1] then switch player object to [characterB#1] and make [CharacterB#2, 3, 4, 5 . . . ] invisible.&quot; Hopefully that brief explanation makes sense.

      "EditableText": "So the first trick that will likely be very helpful here, is knowing that [b:jo3wv3ak]game.pov[/b:jo3wv3ak] always refers to the player controlled character. So regardless of whether you control Character A or Character B, [b:jo3wv3ak]game.pov[/b:jo3wv3ak] will be equal to the one you are in control of.\n\nThe really useful part is how you can pull attributes using this reference. For example, [b:jo3wv3ak]game.pov.alias[/b:jo3wv3ak] will give you the alias of the character you're in control of, and [b:jo3wv3ak]game.pov.parent[/b:jo3wv3ak] will give you the room or object the player is directly inside.\n\nMaking use of this you can create scripts that can check what character you're currently in control of and give the proper output. another piece of info that can help a lot with multiple player characters, is that you can set object and room descriptions as scripts, and not just text. In the setup tab of an object, at the bottom is a description section, there is a drop down menu to select either 'no description', 'text', or 'run script', you'll want the 'run script' option for this. So then as follows you can simply use an If/else script to setup different responses per character.\n\nUnder 'add new script', you want to scroll down to the 'Scripts' section, and 'If...' should be the second option. For the expression on your 'If', you will probably want something like 'game.pov.name = CharacterA', then you use messages to create the text output for that character, and repeat for any extra characters you want with special reactions. In this case if you stick to only two characters then you only need to specify CharacterA for the first response, and CharacterB will just be the 'Else' section, since if you aren't in control of CharacterA you must be in control of CharacterB.\n\nAlso some possibly relevant info about [url=http&#58;//docs&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/quest/tutorial/changing_the_player_object&#46;html:jo3wv3ak]changing the player character[/url:jo3wv3ak]\n\nSo Now that you can script descriptions and such individually for your characters, we can work on cleaning up your actual character objects, so that you won't need 9001 copies of them lying around.\n\nBasically you want to set up a script that whenever you enter a new room, your following character will then be placed in that same room. Fortunately it's not actually that difficult to setup. Earlier I mentioned [b:jo3wv3ak]game.pov.parent[/b:jo3wv3ak], this is important because the room you are currently in is the player objects parent. Since the player is not always the same character we will want to use the [b:jo3wv3ak]game.pov[/b:jo3wv3ak] reference to make sure we are always following the actual player. Fortunately for us, the 'game' object has a built in script section for when you enter a room, it's under the 'script' tab and even listed as 'script when entering a room'\n\nSince we don't want the player to accidentally end up 'following' a stationary npc and getting dragged back to the same room constantly, you will want to use an 'If' statement again to specify which character is doing the following. Then from there you just use 'CharacterB.parent = game.pov.parent' and your CharacterB will then 'follow' your player. And of course when playing CharacterB you will instead have CharacterA follow the player.\n\nAnd here's a section from the quest guides about [url=http&#58;//docs&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/quest/guides/following&#46;html:jo3wv3ak]following the player.[/url:jo3wv3ak]",
