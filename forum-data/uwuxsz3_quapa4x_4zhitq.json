      "EditableText": "For the door, you seem to have a few fragments of old code scattered around. It might be easier to remove the door and exits and recreate them so you're starting from a clean slate.\r\n\r\nQuest's built in \"lock and keys\" functionality only works properly with containers. So the simplest way to make it work is to create an object called \"door\" and make it a closed container. The door's \"Container\" tab lets you choose if it starts closed and locked, how many keys are needed, and which object is the key.\r\n\r\nHowever, you don't want the player to be able to put objects in the door once it's open. So for the \"Script to run when trying to add an object:\" you can put:\r\n```\r\nmsg (Template(\"CannotDoThat\"))\r\n```\r\nThat way, \"put diary in door\" will have exactly the same effect as putting an object in anything else that isn't a container.\r\nYou can also use the \"After opening the object:\" and \"After closing the object:\" scripts if you want to add creaking-door sound effects.\r\n\r\nNow you've got a door object that can be opened, closed, locked, and unlocked.\r\n\r\nThen you create an exit going out, but you give it a script to run:\r\n```\r\nif (GetBoolean (door, \"isopen\")) {\r\n  game.pov.parent = this.to\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  door.to = this.to\r\n  Ask (\"Would you like to open the door?\") {\r\n    if (result) {\r\n      TryOpenClose (true, door)\r\n      if (GetBoolean (door, \"isopen\")) {\r\n        game.pov.parent = door.to\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      msg (\"The door is closed.\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDoing it this way, you don't need to worry about locking the exit. When the player types \"go out\" it will run the script, which does the following:\r\n* `if (GetBoolean (door, \"isopen\"))` - check if the door is open already\r\n     * `game.pov.parent = this.to` - if the door's open, the player can just go through it\r\n* `else {` - if the door isn't open, \r\n    * `door.to = this.to` - make a note of which room the exit leads to (because `this` doesn't play nicely with `Ask`)\r\n    * `Ask ...` - Ask the player if they'd like to open the door\r\n        * `TryOpenClose (...` - try to open the door; which includes checking if the player has a key, playing sound effects, and anything else that needs doing\r\n        * `if (GetBoolean ...` - after trying to open the door, we only go through it if it was successfully opened\r\n            * `game.pov.parent = door.to` - use the note we made earlier about the door's destination, so we don't need to worry about naming the exit.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense :)\r\nI find that explaining a script piece by piece is often a good way to learn.",
