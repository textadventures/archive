      "EditableText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a Quest beginner, which means that I'm mostly able to use the script 'first time' 'otherwise' and 'print message', which is okay but sometimes not enough, because I guess my game will be a bit boring when it's completely made of 'first time', 'otherwise''s... \nSo I have made a telephone and it actually works. The player would be able to dial 112 and 911 and he/she'll also get a message when he/she would dial another number, like 'wrong number!' However, I'd like to have something happen when '0402790326' is dialed and this won't work. It does work with 427 though so now I'm thinking: should each telephone number has three numbers at the most? This would be very weird because well, most telephone numbers have more numbers than just three! So what to do?\n\nI have included a print screen so you can see what I have done.\n\nSorry in advance when I should have known this, but as I already said: I'm a complete beginner...\n\nThanks,\nMarleen\n\n[attachment=0:1rwb2opf]<!-- ia0 -->quest.JPG<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:1rwb2opf]",

Change all your case keys to have quotes around them so that the comparison is always made between two strings. This is better way since you can include leading zeros and have really long numbers should you need them.\n\n2. Use up to 9 digits [b:1ngq4c26]without leading zeros[/b:1ngq4c26] for the phone numbers and don't put quotes around case keys. This is pretty limiting and error prone so I do not recommend you to use it, I am just including it so you can understand how things work.",
