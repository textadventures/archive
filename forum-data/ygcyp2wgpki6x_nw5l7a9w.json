The old site had a 'search your posts/threads' and 'pms' features, for examples, but since Alex was moving on, this new site doesn't have such features. There was a lot of complaining as at the time, as Alex hadn't made it known that he was moving on from quest work (from not that far back) during that time, which you can see here: http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/site/topic/6413/upcoming-changes-to-the-forums\r\n\r\nWe'll see what 'manowar' and the rest of the new team will implement or not with the site and etc quest stuff. We're lucky to get a new team to keep quest and the site and etc stuff alive.
