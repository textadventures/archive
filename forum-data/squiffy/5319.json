Is it possible to create a toggle for a screen reader mode to switch to these edit boxes? While I can navigate away from the Squiffy editor below it to see numbers and of my lines and the text below it, it really makes it hard to edit and know what I'm doing within the edit area.\nThank you.",

The only way to see what I'm doing is to go outside of the edit box and see the line of code, but it's annoying because, even if I find a mistake, I can't easily navigate to the area and remove it in the editor. All of these web-based editors seem to have this issue, at least that's what I'm discovering now.\nI went and made a test game with Quest, made a room called Living Room and added a test description to it with no problems--the editor works great. Than again, that editor is not the code editor where you can see your code. I can see why you use this, and i'm wondering if there's a way to get them to work properly with screen readers, but this is only the second time I've encountered this kind of editor.\nHTH, and if I have to I'll use the CLI, but I really don't want to if I don't need to.",
