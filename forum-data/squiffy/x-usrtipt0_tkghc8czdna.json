      "EditableText": "Me, I just keep a list of descriptive variables (essentially a DIY inventory). You could do it with booleans but I went to integers because you might want to carry multiple items. But it would be something like...\r\n\r\n```\r\n@set key=0\r\n@set sword=0\r\n```\r\nAnd then, when you run your inventory, you might do...\r\n```\r\n[Inventory]:\r\n{if key>0: key ({key} total)}\r\n{if sword>0: sword ({sword} total)}\r\n```\r\nFood and water are portions, of course. But for things like lamps and torches, I just accumulate \"burn time\". So, if a torch gives you 100 minutes of illumination, finding another adds 100 minutes to your total. Of course, this would be listed as....\r\n```\r\n[inventory]:\r\n{if torch>0: torches ({torch} minutes of burn time)}\r\n```\r\n",
