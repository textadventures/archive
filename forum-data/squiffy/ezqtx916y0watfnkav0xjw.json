I have an attribute P1 which depends on the character the player chooses, and I was wondering if I could something like\r\n```\r\n[[start]]:\r\n    var event1  = [`${P1} claims he is almost a God`];\r\n    squiffy.set(\"text\", event1[0]);\r\n\r\n{text}\r\n```\r\nto print a string in my array with the name of the character. I want it to be an array because I want to randomly select one of the entries to print (a problem for another time, but is this possible?).\r\n I guessed it something like this would work by looking at some posts in this forum, but nothing happens when I get to the first line after [[start]]. If I remove the $ it just prints \"{P1} claims...\"\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated :)\r\n",
