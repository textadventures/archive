While putting code in [[]] might work, it also means you're going to get the info at every step, including short combat questions. You don't want to be asked if you'll fight or run and be given your full inventory, too.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how to write a section that works like a function. Simply make sure that retAddr contains the <I>name of the next section</I> so the function knows where to go when done. For inventory, you might even loop back to where you called it from. It works.\r\n\r\nSo here's the example:\r\n```\r\n[[first section]]:\r\n\r\nYou are in the first section.\r\n\r\n@set retAddr=continuing section\r\n\r\n[[function]]\r\n\r\n[[continuing section]]:\r\n\r\nThe play continues...\r\n\r\n[[function]]:\r\n\r\nIN FUNCTION CODE\r\n\r\n[[Return to game]]({retAddr})\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust a trick I picked up.",
