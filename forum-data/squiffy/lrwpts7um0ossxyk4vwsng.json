So if, say, city guards come up and question you, the next time they come up, they are going to run you in under vagrancy charges. The point is, keep moving along.\r\n\r\nUsing \"seen\" would be ideal here. However, I need a way to unsee everything in the next town. Is there a way to do this that dosn't involve resetting the entire game? ",
