Squiffy!!! \nI've instantly downloaded and installed both and I'm toying a little with \nSquiffy. I find it amusing and very well done (giving the opportunity to publish\nour gamebooks as phone apps). Just wanted to know if someone has already\nmanaged to insert images in a gamebook done with Squiffy without breaking\nthe HTML ?\n\nRic",
