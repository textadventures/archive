      "EditableText": "If it's a *section* (as in the example you quote):\r\n```\r\n[[Passage]]:\r\nThis is a section named \"Passage\".\r\n```\r\nthen you can do:\r\n```\r\n    var text = squiffy.story.sections[\"Passage\"].text;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nIf it's a passage in the current section, like this:\r\n```\r\n[Passage]:\r\nThis is a passage called \"Passage\".\r\n```\r\nthen you can do:\r\n```\r\n    var text = squiffy.story.section.passages[\"Passage\"].text;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nIf it's a passage but not in the current section, for example:\r\n```\r\n[[Section]]:\r\nThis is a section named \"Section\".\r\n\r\n[Passage]:\r\nAnd this is a passage named \"Passage\" inside the section named \"Section\".\r\n```\r\nthen you would do:\r\n```\r\n    var text = squiffy.story.sections[\"Section\"].passages[\"Passage\"].text;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nHowever, you should note that if that section/passage contains any text processor stuff (like `{if` or `{Attribute}`) those might not be processed. If you want to get the text as it would display, then you will need to run the text processor over it first. I believe this is:\r\n<pre><code>    var text = <b style=\"color: blue\">squiffy.ui.processText(</b>squiffy.story.sections[\"Passage\"].text<b style=\"color: blue\">)</b>;</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThe text you get by this method won't be quite the same as what you entered in the Squiffy editor; because line breaks and section/passage links are converted to HTML when the game is compiled. But I think in most circumstances you won't need to worry about that.\r\n\r\nSorry if I got any of the names wrong; I'm on my phone here, so answering off the top of my head.",
