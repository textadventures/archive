I haven't been keeping count of the current total number of the  attributes I made to track the player's personality choices and it just occurred to me that this might be a problem in the future with my plans for the story. So is there a way I could keep track of the **total** amount of each attribute available in the story without having to add it all up myself? Or will I have to keep track of it? ",
