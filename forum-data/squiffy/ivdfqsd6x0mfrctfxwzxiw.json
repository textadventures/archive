I am unsure if this is just a server error.  When running a preview, it works fine, but after saving any changes, the published work is not picking up on any of the edits and is still has typos or starting in the middle of the story.\r\n\r\nI have had to publish (unlisted) the same story 3 times in order to have the edits stick and now I have 2 faulty stories that need to be deleted. Does anyone know of anything that can help or if anyone else has been having this problem?\r\n",
