I'm a huge noob and tried using Squiffy for a IF I'm planning to make, and I have some problems.\r\n\r\nYou see, I'm only possibly less than a percent finished with the thing, and I wanted my friend to try out what I've got so far. I know you could upload unlisted games here in TA and I tried doing so. I clicked the Build command in my Squiffy and see as a new tab shows up for a preview. I reviewed using that preview and once done, I put my index, jquery, story and style files into a ZIP file and uploaded it as unlisted.\r\n\r\nMy friend and I both tried it, but for some reason, the links are broken. I said to her that I'm gonna try it again once I redo everything, since I was just testing a bit of how this thing works.\r\n\r\nSo I did that and then saved the game as a whole new file in a different folder in Squiffy. I then clicked Build for it to generate the files I needed, and I went on to my games and updated the game file so that's it's going to be the new version.\r\n\r\nI tried and for some reason, it's still the old version. But this time, the links work now. I want to update my files to the newer version, but I don't know how. I tried doing it again but it still shows the working old version. Anyone help me?",
