I saw the pulldown in the editor's upper left but that shows the code only, but does not execute it. It would be handy if you could leap deep into the story and pick it up from there.\n\nI suppose the only way to do this is to put a temporary shunt in your story to leap ahead for testing.\n\nFinally got to work on my tale during lunch and I really like this tool - you can cover vast amounts of ground while throwing all sorts of twists and turns in.\n\nOh, and Santa? Next Christmas, will you bring me a spell-checker?",
