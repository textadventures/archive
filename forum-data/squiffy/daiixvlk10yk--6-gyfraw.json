      "EditableText": "Alright, so I've been working on a squiffy project for a while and just recently updated a small part of it, just in the editor I didn't update the actual game. The game is currently published, but unlisted. \r\n\r\nNow, my Chrome browser stopped responding earlier last night, so I was forced to force quit it. I was pretty sure that Squiffy autosaves, because what DOESN'T autosave these days? I mean, I never had to press a save button any other time, so why would this be different? I'm assuming that I was wrong, and not saving was the cause of the problem. That part is my fault, but what is currently happening is... well, you tell me, because I'm stumped. \r\n\r\nMy game ruined right now. I have a backup of the new stuff that I wrote, so If that were all that was lost, I'd be fine, but nope. It's never that simple for me. \r\n\r\nNo, the whole game is BROKEN. When I'm looking in my games, it says the game is [Squiffy] Untitled, and even when I go update the title, it still stays like that. Now, I can go to the unlisted game, and play it, and it's okay, just missing the part I updated, but when I go to edit the game, there is no code. It's just blank. How can there be no code, but I can still play the game? I don't have any of that code saved, so I'm completely screwed if I can't get it back.\r\n\r\nThis is confusing and frustrating, so if anyone knows how to help it would be much appreciated. It took me a long time to find the motivation to write this, so losing it would be devastating.",
