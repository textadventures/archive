I read the tutorials and FAQ's multiple times, trying to figure out how the heck it is supposed to work, but there's still something I clearly missed.\r\nI downloaded Phonegap on the PC and on the phone. I opened the Pc program and followed the instruction to \"add\" a new project. It worked and it asked me to select the local path, which I did picking the folder where all the stuff from my game was generated hitting the \"build\" button in Squiffy.\r\nNow, reading around I saw people writing that they copied file x in folder y and so on, but I swear that I don't find anywhere any clue that I'm supposed to move files around, and no clue about what exactly has to be moved where.\r\nSo please, I beg you, is there anyone out there who has successfully used Phonegap and can somehow help me?\r\nThank you! I will credit your name in my game if you help me!",
