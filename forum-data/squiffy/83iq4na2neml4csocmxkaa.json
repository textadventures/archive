But that's really ugly.\r\n\r\nI got something like this to work:\r\n```\r\n    this.text += \"<sty\" + \"le>@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Liu+Jian+Mao+Cao&family=ZCOOL+KuaiLe&display=swap');</st\" + \"yle>\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family:Liu Jian Mao Cao;\">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!?</span>\r\n```\r\n(putting a break in the middle of \"style\" so that the compiler doesn't strip it out)\r\n\r\nI've also tried reducing the javascript to a simple:\r\n```\r\n    this.text = replace (/stile/g, \"style\");\r\n```\r\nThen you can use `<stile>` in your passage, and it will be changed to `<style>` before Squiffy attempts to display it. But in this case, Squiffy recognises your URI as such, and magically tries to make it into a link, so you end up with:\r\n```\r\n<style>\r\n@import url('<a href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Liu+Jian+Mao+Cao&family=ZCOOL+KuaiLe&display=swap\">https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Liu+Jian+Mao+Cao&family=ZCOOL+KuaiLe&display=swap</a>');\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\nwhich understandably fails to work.\r\n\r\nAt present, I think that using JS to add your style information is probably the best method.",
