      "EditableText": "The best advice I can give is before you do anything else make an \"Extended StringList\" in Word or something to that effect and write down, every single variable that has to do with your main character (or characters). For example, I have this... \r\n```\r\nplayer.haircolor: brunette 0, white 1, red 2, black 3, dirty blonde 4, platinum blonde 5, green 6, purple 7, dark red 8, orange 9, blue 10, ombre 11, neon 12, pastel 13, pink 14, silver 15, rainbow 16.\r\n\r\nplayer.hairlength: bald 0, buzzed 1, short 2, shoulder length 3, long 4, very long 5, extremely long 6, dragging on the ground long 7.\r\n{if player.hairlength_as_int>=1:}\r\n```\r\nThat way, you never lose track of your variables. \r\n\r\nNext, keep \"sections\" or \"chapters\" clustered together. Like...\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n------- Starting Room\r\n------- Room Stuff Happens\r\n------- Room Stuff Happens\r\n------- Room Stuff Happens\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n-------Starting Room\r\n-------Room Stuff Happens\r\netc\r\n\r\n....And finally, I recommend Notepad++ --- it's free software that you can plug code directly into. It's also handy for large edits. If you need anymore advice lemme know!",
