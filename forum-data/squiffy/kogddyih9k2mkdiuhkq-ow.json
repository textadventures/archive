      "EditableText": "Hello. \r\nMy apologies for this question. I have crawled through this forum, but I simply STILL don't understand what I have to do to make it work. I think I need babysteps here, because I simply do not understand what I have to do. \r\n\r\nI wanted to publish that game to a few people to play privately on their own computers. \r\n\r\nSo I have the xxx.sq file. I put it in a new folder and clicked \"build\". I received the files. \r\nI made a zip folder. 1 without the .sq file, one with. I tried uploading them. \"invalid file type.\" (.zip)\r\n\r\nI grabbed the .html version. (Index). I tried uploading it. It worked, I received a thing to type in the name etc. A \"Play\" button appeared. I clicked it. There was  the word \"restart\" in the upper left corner. It wasn't a clickable link. \r\n\r\nEverywhere in this forum, people say \"just click build and put those files into a zip folder.\" I did. \r\nBut when I tried to open that here, there is just that \"restart\" thing, which is not clickable.  I uploaded that roughly 10 minutes ago. Do I simply have to wait longer until the server has updated?\r\n\r\nI don't get it. What should I zip up exactly, how do I upload it?\r\n\r\nAnd when I somehow have managed to do that, what exactly do I send to people? \r\n\r\nWhat do I tell them to do in order to play it off the website? Do they need some kind of flashplayer or something?\r\n\r\nHelp please. I am profoundly confused. \r\n\r\nEdit: also I cannot upload a picture on the site. I always get a runtime error. ",

In other words, if you have a folder \"MyGame\" containing all your game files, go to explorer where you see the folder \"MyGame\", right click on that, and send it to the compressed files. This should zip up a nice contained bundle. This zip is what you send.\r\n\r\nThen email this to your friends. They should be able to unzip the folder whereever they want, go into it and click your special \"ClickMe\" file. This should start the game for them.\r\n\r\nLet me know it this works.",
