(And because we instinctively look for patterns.) They can seem odd at first, but if you were to run your code above 1000 times, clusters would occur, but things would even out over the entire series. (Not entirely, though.  As I understand it, getting each of the five numbers to come up *exactly* 20% of the time would be somewhat unusual - maybe once in 10 / 100 ?  tries.)",
