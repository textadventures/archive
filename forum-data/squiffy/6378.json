      "EditableText": "Had a really close call with Squiffy last night. Been working on a big game, out to 1500 lines. Worked on it on and off over the weekend, just enjoying myself. Last night after dinner, I sat down with a bunch of new ideas I had and entered them in over two hours or so. New sections here, new sections there, additions to code all over the place.\n\nThen I went to run it.\n\nSyntax error.\n\nUh oh.\n\nFortunately, I remembered one line I didn't think would work. I went there, deleted it, hit run - the adventure started up. But that made me think - Since Squiffy doesn't identify failures by line number (or even the text of the line), it's probably a good idea to hit run every so often while developing just to make sure the thing works. In my case, if it hadn't been that line, I don't know what I would have done to find it. Probably delete section by section until it started up, just to find it.",
