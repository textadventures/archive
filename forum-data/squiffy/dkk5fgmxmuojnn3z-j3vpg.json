The Pixie is the author of Quest 6, and he already has [a dungeon-crawler in Quest 5](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/em15b32xd0o-y-ysvgrtcg/deeper).  So, I'm betting he probably made Quest 6 capable of handling all that and more.\r\n\r\nAlso, Quest 6 is pure JS.

I just bother The Pixie and manowar quite frequently and pick up little pieces of information here and there.  I'm pretty sure I read (somewhere in all the Quest 6 documentation) that it wasn't going to do gamebooks because we already have Squiffy.\r\n\r\nNow, if we're wondering if Squiffy will continue to be maintained or something like that, it's on GitHub.  So, I'm thinking the worst case scenario would be some of us pushing our own updates to that repo.  This is total conjecture, though.  Plus, to be repetitive, and to be repetitive, I haven't seen any sign that Squiffy might be going the way of the dodo.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMe?  I'm pretty sure I'm about to use Squiffy to make a HELP \"section\" in the Quest 6 game <s>I'm working on</s> on which I am currently working.\r\n\r\nI did something similar with Twine in an Inform 7 game before.\r\n\r\n---\r\nHas there been a decrease in Squiffy usage?\r\n\r\n(I really only check out the Squiffy forum when the title of a thread jumps out and grabs my attention.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nPS\r\n\r\nOh!
