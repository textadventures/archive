Then give it a `onkeyup` handler. In the case of pressing an arrow that corresponds to a non-disabled compass button, send a click to the relevant compass button; for any other key, send the keypress event back to the command bar and move focus there (so once you've started typing a command, the arrow keys will move the cursor around within it normally).\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a better way to do it, but this is the first one that comes to mind for me.",
