      "EditableText": "> it requires the player to enter a specific command to begin the game.\r\n\r\nI've not tried the game in question, but I know a few games that start with the player asleep and require a command like \"open eyes\" or \"wake up\" before you can do anything.\r\nThe easiest way to do something like that is to put some commands in the room with the player. If the player's input matches both a command in the room, and a global command, the one in the room will be used.\r\n\r\nFirst command, name `asleep`, pattern `#text#` (or `.` if you're using regular expressions), script:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"You can't do that while you're asleep.\")\r\n```\r\nThat pattern will match *anything* the player types, so the command script will be run any time they type anything.\r\n\r\nThen the second command. Name `wake`, pattern `wake up;wake;awake`, script:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"You open your eyes.\")\r\nShowRoomDescription()\r\nRemoveObject (asleep)\r\n```\r\nThis removes the restriction on what the player can enter.\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border-top: 1px solid grey\">\r\n\r\nAn alternative is for the start script or the first room's \"enter\" script to present the player with a menu. If the menu doesn't allow the player to cancel it, then they can't enter commands until it is dealt with. This option is more often used with RPG type games that have some kind of character creation, games that ask you to select a difficulty level, or similar.\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border-top: 1px solid grey\">\r\n\r\n> Aside from that, I'd also like to know how to ask a yes or no question that can start the game or end it.\r\n\r\njmnevil's solution works if you want to require the player to type \"yes\" or \"no\". Note that as given, nothing will happen if the player types something else (like \"y\", or \"YES\").\r\n\r\nIf you want to use something like this, I'd strongly suggest handling the default case. If this is in the \"on first enter\" script for the starting room, you might want to do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Do you want to proceed? \")\r\nget input {\r\n  switch (LCase (result)) {\r\n    case (\"yes\", \"y\") {\r\n      MoveObject (player, room)\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"no\", \"n\") {\r\n      finish\r\n    }\r\n    default {\r\n      msg (\"Please type 'yes' or 'no'.\")\r\n      do (starting room, \"firstenter\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis version:\r\n* uses `LCase` to convert \"Yes\" or \"YES\" to \"yes\", in case the player has caps lock on or something\r\n* uses `switch` rather than `if`, so that \"yes\" and \"y\" are understood as the same thing (you can list as many variants as you want)\r\n* runs a `default` section if the player types something unexpected\r\n    * The `do (starting room, \"firstenter\")` line runs the on-first-enter script of the room named `starting room`; asking the question again.\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border-top: 1px solid grey\">\r\n\r\n> Aside from that, I'd also like to know how to ask a yes or no question that can start the game or end it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the more user-friendly way to ask a yes or no question is:\r\n```\r\nAsk (\"Do you want to proceed?\") {\r\n  if (result) {\r\n    MoveObject (player, room)\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    finish\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis uses `Ask`, which displays \"yes\" and \"no\" buttons on the screen.\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border-top: 1px solid grey\">\r\n\r\nAlso note that it's not necessary to put the player in a separate starting room (though some people prefer to). You can also turn off showing the room description for the starting room; if a script shows a menu, this means that the player won't see the starting room immediately.
