I do not know if this is appropriate or not, but I wanted to tell you about the software I am busy creating with which you can create online interface fiction, just like with Quest.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong, I really really liked Quest, but there were something I wanted to do that I could not find in Quest.\n\nThe editor is still far from completed.  It is only in alpha (main features complete, but still buggy).  If any of you guys ever wanted to see what it looks like, head over to [url:lm5q7z7z]http&#58;//www&#46;sillygamesstudio&#46;com[/url:lm5q7z7z].  It is an online editor, currently with now server-side saving or processing.  The entire editor with built-in player runs on the client (browser).  If you create a new story, you can download it to your local machine, and also upload it again to modify/play it.\n\nI plan on adding server-side saving as well as full publishing of your end product as a complete, stand-alone, publishable web site.\n\nAnyways... Just wanted to show it to you and perhaps get some critique... \n\nKind regards,\n\nBridgette",
