      "EditableText": "Your question does make sense. It's about not duplicating things all over the place. Generally, the answer is that it depends on what you're doing. For example, the case you gave is *almost* handled already. When you enter a room, it dumps out the room description. If you type &quot;l&quot; or &quot;look&quot;, it uses the same description. So that's done. You just need to make the specific phrase &quot;look at room&quot; also map to the same call: ShowRoomDescription.\n\nFor other situations, the pattern is similar. You either need to have the text in a common place that can be accessed from multiple places of script, or you need to have a common function you can call from those places.\n\nNot sure if that helped, but...",
