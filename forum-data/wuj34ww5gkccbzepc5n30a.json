(The panes will only display if the screen width is greater than 962 (or 1000), so you'll probably want to (maybe) look at the code in the Mobile directory in Quest's source code to see the best way to handle things in mobile.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nAn alternative to Android Studio is PhoneGap.  You will still need to know how to convert a website into an app, and I think you have to upload files to their site to have the apps emailed to you (and I do not know if they charge for this service).\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Rules while creating the game\r\n\r\n- No map\r\n\r\n- Avoid setting up additional script dictionary attributes\r\n\r\n- Do not mess with the display settings\r\n\r\n- Don't add anything to your game which might create unknown problems!
