It runs when the game starts and ends with a key press after the intro is over.  I want to be able to remove/hide the panes and the input box during the introduction.  When the key press signals the end of the intro, I want those things to return.  Is there not like a HidePanes type of code like there is the HideCommandBar?  That would be nice =)\n\nPossible ideas I have and would be perfectly happy to use, but have no real clue how to implement are:\n\n1.  Remove them (or turn them off) on start up, have them show up when player is transferred to the starting room.\n2.  Hide them and make them reappear.\n3.  Have them turned off and transfer the player to a new file start up (with panes/command visible/useable) at key press.\n4.  Is it possible to start the intro room off with entirely black colors so that it blends with my background (making it invisible) and change it back to the original colors at key press?\n---\nYucky, but better than nothing....\n5.  Attach a link to the game description that the player can click separately from the game file - which obviously would make the intro optional (boo!) - this I could do and wouldn't need help with.\n6.  Leave the panes visible, but disable all mouse/keyboard activity until key press.\n\nI know this is a mess of a post, but... there you have it.  Thanks in advance!\n\n----\n\nThis is the old version of the title intro if you are interested in looking at it.  It's been updated since this post and is much better, but you'll get the idea about the panes on the right side.  I do have the command box hidden here so that's not an issue.\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/e6kumlko6kebi58ai9yeyw/title-test\">http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ ... title-test</a><!-- m -->",
