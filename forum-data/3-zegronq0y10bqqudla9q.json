Don't know exactly what I want to do, because I'm not sure exactly what ConvLib CAN do. But I'm sure the first step must be to somehow convince Quest that ConvLib is right there in the game directory. Am I supposed to copy code in ConvLib to Code View??\r\n\r\nAt sea here - Appreciate any advice.",
