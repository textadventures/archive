I will definitely tell my friend to check his ASL library.  One thing about that is confusing though.  As I make updates to my game, I save it as \"filename0909\" Where 0909 is the date I complete the update.  So when I email it home, I have several versions of the same game.  My very first one was \"filename\" without the date.  I sent 5 versions to my friend, one with no date and 4 with the date in the filename.  Strangely, only the one without the date works and that, of course, is a very early version of the game.  I'm pretty sure we tried saving the latest version as \"filename\" without the date and he still couldn't open it.  We will get together and research his ASL library location to make sure it is in the right place.
