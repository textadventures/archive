With a large monitor, I'd like to drag those windows to the side. I don't think this is critical to program in at the startup. I'd like to see the program continue to place the window where the user dragged it.\n\nYes, resizing the text box as a user option would be great. I'd prefer to see the Windows standard for resizing all internal frames. Right now, the only way to resize the Inventory, for example, is to increase the entire window, increasing all internal frames at once.\n\nChuck",
