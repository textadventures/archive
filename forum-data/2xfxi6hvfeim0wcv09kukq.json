I'm having a problem with the input bar (or command bar, I'm not sure what the official label is. Player input.) It vanishes whenever I use \"call function\". I've seen it in various situations, but I'm only going to ask about this specific instance. I write a function, it's 'print msg, get input, else if, else if, else'. Two possible answers to the print msg question. Which work perfectly. The \"Else\" script is to print msg, call function (same function) so it repeats. like \"invalid answer... question again\". And it seems to work, the question DOES re display, however, the input bar vanishes - so the player cannot do anything. They see the error msg, AND see the question posed again, but no prompt. I don't understand why this is happening. And I don't really know how to ask about it. \r\nI won't understand answers with extensive lines of code, I do know how to read basic stuff - but without precise copy/paste instructions it won't help me.  \r\n\r\nThanks anyone!",
