For example object a could be a lit match and object b a lamp. So far so straight forward. But I also want 'light lamp' to work too as some players may try that. Do I have to set this up as a verb/command instead and do an object check or is there a simple way of adding alternative commands to what I have done that return the same action?",

I've ran away from functions, for now, but realised that use match on lamp is dealt with in the match actions (or is in my example) but the verb is added to the lamp ie - light lamp.
