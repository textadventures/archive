Following the tutorial, I got as far as installing it and getting to the Create New Game screen. I have selected a folder and game name, I have chosen Text Adventure and I have chosen English. Yet the OK button will not illuminate. Only the Cancel. It doesn't seem to matter which folder I choose or which game name I type, I cannot move forward, the OK button stays dim and unselectable. Please tell me what I'm doing wrong? Thanks a million!!",
