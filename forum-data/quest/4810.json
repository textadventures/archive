I've called the room/exit 'elevator' in the description and while the game accepts 'go lift' when going from apartment to outside, it will not recognise the same word when trying to return, and the player has to use 'go elevator' instead.\n\nNow, I have two elevators (elevator and elevator2). 'Elevator' takes you down, 'elevator2' takes you back up (because I couldn't figure out how to make the same elevator go both ways). In the alias for both, I have added the names 'elevator; lift', but it is only when entering the elevator from my apartment that the game accepts the command 'go lift'.\n\nAnyway, that's not really what this thread is about. What I want is for someone to clear up how we get the game to recognise different names.\n\nIn my apartment I use non-directionals (just seems silly to me to have a description which says &quot;You are in the bedroom. The bathroom lies to the east&quot;). So to get from the bedroom to the bathroom, the player types 'go bathroom'. Now I'm not saying I'm having any difficult setting this up, and my game so far works how I want it to. [i:2eqrescu]But[/i:2eqrescu], I don't really understand how the game understands 'go bathroom'.\n\nIs it simply the name you've given the room, or is it some alias you have to add somewhere? And if it is the alias, why doesn't my game understand 'go lift' for my second elevator?",

      "EditableText": "Thank you, HK, sorry I didn't explain my problem better.\n\nI looked again, and it seems I needed to include the aliases of 'lift' and 'elevator' in the set-up tab for the [i:3ijbafda]exits[/i:3ijbafda] as well as in the room itself. This is where I was going wrong. Now that I have included these aliases in the exits, both terms are accepted.\n\nSo let me just make sure I'm clear on this. If I want to create extra words for a room/exit, to make sure it accepts anything the player may feasibly use, I must put the aliases (separated with a semi-colon) in the set-up tab of BOTH the room AND the exit?\n\nNow all I need to figure out is how to get it to understand the verb 'use' in the context of 'use lift'/'use elevator'. If I try adding 'use' in the verb tab of the room/exit, or in the list of verbs at the top of the left panel, I get told 'use' is already in use, and yet my game won't accept 'use lift'/'use elevator'.\n\nI thought I'd figured this out when I suddenly realised I needed to set my elevator to 'Object and/or room' - so that the 'Use/Give' tab would be activated. I added the same script from the 'Room' tab to the 'Use/Give' tab, so that the same sequence would be played if the player typed 'use' instead of 'go', but when I run it, 'use lift/'use elevator' gets the response, &quot;I can't see that.&quot;\n\nI know I'm missing something blindingly obvious, but I don't know what.\n\nHere's the entire code as I don;t know what part you need.\n\nJust to reiterate, I'm now ONLY needing to find out why 'use lift/'use elevator' doesn't work.\n\n[code:3ijbafda]&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;5&#46;5328&#46;26617--&gt;\n&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

      "HTML": "Thank you, HK, sorry I didn't explain my problem better.<br/><br/>I looked again, and it seems I needed to include the aliases of 'lift' and 'elevator' in the set-up tab for the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">exits</span> as well as in the room itself. This is where I was going wrong. Now that I have included these aliases in the exits, both terms are accepted.<br/><br/>So let me just make sure I'm clear on this. If I want to create extra words for a room/exit, to make sure it accepts anything the player may feasibly use, I must put the aliases (separated with a semi-colon) in the set-up tab of BOTH the room AND the exit?<br/><br/>Now all I need to figure out is how to get it to understand the verb 'use' in the context of 'use lift'/'use elevator'. If I try adding 'use' in the verb tab of the room/exit, or in the list of verbs at the top of the left panel, I get told 'use' is already in use, and yet my game won't accept 'use lift'/'use elevator'.<br/><br/>I thought I'd figured this out when I suddenly realised I needed to set my elevator to 'Object and/or room' - so that the 'Use/Give' tab would be activated. I added the same script from the 'Room' tab to the 'Use/Give' tab, so that the same sequence would be played if the player typed 'use' instead of 'go', but when I run it, 'use lift/'use elevator' gets the response, &quot;I can't see that.&quot;<br/><br/>I know I'm missing something blindingly obvious, but I don't know what.<br/><br/>Here's the entire code as I don;t know what part you need.<br/><br/>Just to reiterate, I'm now ONLY needing to find out why 'use lift/'use elevator' doesn't work.<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;5&#46;5328&#46;26617--&gt;<br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;
