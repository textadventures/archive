I looked up an old forum for turn combat, and I digged up some code that HegemonKhan wrote.\r\nI'd message him myself if I knew how.\r\n(Forum/code link) http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/5703/turn-based-combat\r\nI simply need to know how to set up an attack and how to type up/start the attack command.\r\nAlso, if I could get a version of this without speed, and where the enemy always goes last, that would be nice. But if it's too difficult I guess I'd just stick with this.",
