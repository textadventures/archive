Fair enough. I can change the `addscript` to make it work as desired (put in as many items as will fit). But because of the eccentricities of the web editor, it's a bit of a pain adding attributes. So, before I get started, can I ask suggestions on what will be less effort in the long run?\r\n\r\n**Method 1**\r\n1. Enable the \"Inventory limits\" feature.\r\n2. Add to the start script:\r\n```\r\nforeach (box, FilterByType(AllObjects(), \"limited_container\")) {\r\n  box.addscript => {\r\n    // my modified version of the one from CoreTypes.aslx\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Method 2**\r\n1. Don't enable limited containers.\r\n2. Put the limit-checking in a couple of functions.\r\n3. Call those functions from the put/drop/take commands.\r\n4. Use initialisation scripts (bah) to set the limit and maxitem attributes of all the containers.\r\n\r\n**Method 3**\r\nIs there an easier option I'm missing?",
