      "EditableText": "that error message is likely due to that you've changed the name of your Player Object, and hence it can't find a 'player' Player Object, which my code uses/is-looking-for (for example: player.condition ---> ERROR: no 'player' Player Object is found, as it doesn't exist, due to you changing its name, and thus its 'WHATEVER_YOU_NAMED_IT_AS' Player Object, and not 'player' Player Object, so change the code to match up, example: WHATEVER_YOU_NAMED_IT_AS.condition)\r\n\r\n'player' is the default name of the Player Object, so if you changed the name of your Player Object, then simply put in the name of your Player Object where-ever you see 'player' in the code (replace any/all instances of 'player' with your name of the Player Object within your code), or you can use 'game.pov' instead of 'player' within your code, as well. The built-in 'pov' Object reference/pointer Attribute on your special 'game' Game-Settings-and-Publishing-Info, determines what Player Object (if you got more than one of them) you're currently controlling, and also it will refer to who-ever is your currently controlled Player Object (whatever you got them named as)\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nusing 'game.pov', as this will work regardless of whatever you got your Player Object named as\r\n\r\nusing 'this' too, which refers to the parent Object of the scripting that you use 'this' within, as again, it'll work regardless of whatever you
