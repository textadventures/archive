      "EditableText": "Hi, \r\nI'm trying to create a book where the player will glue pages. Only certain objects can be added. After the glue, the player cannot remove it. \r\nI did something like this: created a transparent surface. Because I cannot figure out how to control what can be added, I designed the surface as closed, and the pages are automatically added to the book by an script when found. This all works fine, the player can access the pages, and cannot drop then.\r\nHowever, the message when he tries to drop the page is the problem:\r\n\"Book is not open.\"\r\nI can't figure out how to change this message to something such as \"You don't want the tear the book apart\" (ObjectNotOpen template)\r\nSo I went to plan B. I created a new type that inherits from surface, and I overrode the put and remove commands in order to control what can be added to the surface (and preventing anything from being removed). \r\nIt is kind of working, but I think I overdid the solution. The command override is global, so I had to copy the code from corecommands.aslx, adding an if such as:\r\n\r\n    <command name=\"removeSpell\">\r\n        <pattern>remove #object1# from #object2#</pattern>\r\n        <script>\r\n        if (HasAttribute(object2, \"no_remove\")) {\r\n\t\tmsg (\"you cannot remove this.\")\r\n         } else  if (not Contains(object2, object1)) { // copied from corecommands\r\n\t\tmsg (DynamicTemplate(\"ObjectDoesNotContain\", object2, object1))\r\n         } else {\r\n\t        DoTake (object1, false)\r\n         }\r\n\r\nIs there another way to do that?Could I call something like super() on command? if not, I would suggest to place all command logic in functions, so that the developer don´t need to copy code from corecommands.\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n",
