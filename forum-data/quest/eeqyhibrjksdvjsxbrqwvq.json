      "EditableText": "I am attempting to create a randomized dungeon in my game. Firstly, I iteratively clone a master tile according to the size of the dungeon, and gave each clone specific coordinates. After running an algorithm that decides which tile will be a corridor, room or wall, I used the ```create exit``` function to link the tiles accordingly. A room tile is randomly chosen, and a one-way exit, going 'in', is created from the dungeon_entrance room to the selected tile.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem that I am facing is mapping out the resulting dungeon. The map works fine until entering the dungeon. When moving between the cloned tiles, nothing observable happens at the map display. The player icon remains at place, with no new rooms being drawn out. To me, it seems that the map fails to recognize that the player object has moved when moving to a cloned room.\r\n\r\nIn short, how do I get the map to draw itself when moving between cloned rooms?",
