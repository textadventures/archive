Since it doesn't change with the default link color there must be somewhere separate that tells Quest what color to make it, but I can't seem to suss it out. It's obviously not a huge deal or a problem for functionality, but it would be nice to utilize a wait and have the text fit in with the game's color scheme (and to ideally be able to change the font as well, though color would be the bigger priority).\n\nI know the whole &lt;color color=&quot;colorname&quot;&gt;&lt;/color&gt; thing and how to use CDATA tags and all, but putting that into the template text just kills the &quot;Continue...&quot; text entirely. Am I missing something really obvious? I still find things like the Core and language libraries pretty daunting to look at.",
