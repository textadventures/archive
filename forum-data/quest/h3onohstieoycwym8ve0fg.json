      "EditableText": "This is where Attributes and Variables come in! There's many, many different ways to do this. Here is how I would:\r\n\r\n1. Create Player.NextRoom, set as an Object type variable. This, basically, stores the data of where you want that command to move the player to.\r\n2. When applicable, change what room Player.NextRoom is, whenever you want to change where the command will bring you.\r\n3. Under your command, and pardon my psuedocode, change the 'move the player' from:\r\n```\r\nMove object:Player to object:WhateverRoom\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\nMove object:Player to expression:Player.NextRoom\r\n```\r\nThis will make the game check what it wants to move - Player - and where it wants to move it to - whatever you assigned Player.NextRoom to be. If you want special dialogue - \"You walk to the dungeon and wrinkle your nose at the smell\" vs \"You walk to the kitchen and smile at the smell of baked goods\" - you can use If-Then-Else:\r\n```\r\nif Player.NextRoom=Dungeon, print \"It stinks in here\"\r\netc\r\netc\r\n```\r\nHope this helps!",
