      "EditableText": "Hi there, I just started using Quest 5.8 this weekend and have been reading tutorials, the manual, and doing what I do best which is learning through use. After a few days, I've got a question I haven't been able to find an answer to, and a problem I'm not entirely sure is a problem or not. I'll put these as Question 1 and Problem A.\r\n\r\n**Question 1**: Is there a way to set up Quest 5.8 so that it defaults to \"Code View\" instead of the GUI view when editing or creating scripts? The GUI is nice for people learning to code, but I prefer the Code View as it lets me get my hands right into the code without having to navigate through buttons and drop-down menus.  Every script on an object starts in GUI view and I have to change it to Code View, and then it resets if I select a different object. I'd rather it just uses Code View automatically and let's me change to GUI view should I need it, but there doesn't seem to be any configuration for the application that I can tweak to change this.\r\n\r\n**Problem A**: I've found that when I first start the program, and am knee-deep in code, snippets of code that I change do not retain the changes as I select other objects or run the game. For example, I was working on a flashlight object yesterday, editing the \"turn on\" and \"turn off\" verb scripts, and copied/pasted from \"turn on\" into \"turn off\", edited it to obviously work in the reverse, then saved and ran my game. It didn't work. I came back to the code and the changes I had made were gone... the \"turn off\" code matched the \"turn on\" code. This keeps happening, and it drives me nuts when it does. I've taken to copying large portions of script and pasting it into notepad while testing my code out of fear that I'll lose any changes I make and not realize it. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this a known issue, or is it me? I've questioned whether I need to be clicking \"save\" after every change in order to force it to stick. It just seems odd to edit code, click a different attribute, click back to the attribute I just changed and find my changes are gone. It's also incredibly frustrating.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I am currently in love with Quest and am enjoying programming my first adventure game, a monster hunt that I plan to expand with the coming days.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and if you take the time to respond to my questions!\r\n\r\n.oO WDalphin Oo.",

      "EditableText": "Question 1, I can't answer because my experience is only with the web editor, which is even more restrictive in that regard.\r\n\r\nProblem A, I've not seen this mentioned on the desktop before, but it's a fairly common complaint with the web editor. In its efforts to reduce the data exchanged with the server, Quest checks if the value of a field has changed when the cursor moves out of it, and only saves the fields that have this change flag set. This means that in some circumstances, you need to move the cursor into a different textbox on the page to make sure the flag is set before going to a different object.\r\n\r\nThere's also the possibility that it will fail to save invalid code sometimes, reverting to the previous version because it's holding something that wouldn't be valid XML if reloaded. On the web editor, this can be caused by lines like `variable = \"</span>\"`, which can be edited in the GUI but not in code view. I believe that if you're looking at the XML code view on desktop (with all the `<object>` and `<attr>` stuff), improperly closed tags may be discarded because if they were saved, the engine would be unable to open the file at all.\r\n\r\nThe most likely cause for this would be a missing `<![CDATA[` section, depending how deep into code view you're getting. A script or string attribute which contains XML or HTML (or even just contains a `<` character somewhere) must start with `<![CDATA[` and end with `]]>` to ensure that the load function doesn't try to treat it as an attribute inside another attribute.\r\n\r\nI've got no idea if either of these issues is cropping up in your situation, but it might be worth watching out for them.",

      "EditableText": "Thank you for the reply!\r\n\r\nI had wondered if the trouble I'm experiencing is related to the design of the interface. I've noticed that I can see the script in the \"Value\" field of the Attributes pane, and that the field doesn't show any changes you make in the Assignment pane until \"Save\" is clicked. \"Undo\" also does not undo text changes you make. But if you're in the GUI view, changes you make are instantaneously shown in the Values field. So I suspect it has something to do with it not wanting to constantly update the Values field until all your typing changes are made.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I've made a change in one field, then clicked into another field and immediately gone back and the changes are lost. So it's not as simple as clicking on another field. It seems that clicking the GUI/Code View button snaps the changes into the field. So there's that or Save, but it'd be nice if they just automatically take because I lose so much time just from forgetting to make sure the code snaps into that Value field and doesn't get lost.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely not anything to do with bad code. I've actually put in bad code and it remembers it... even if it complains that the code is severely flawed and fails to format it properly as a result, it still remembers it. In fact, I've found that putting in broken code is the one way to ensure that the GUI view doesn't default, because it can't convert the code to the GUI design and puts me in Code View until I fix it.
