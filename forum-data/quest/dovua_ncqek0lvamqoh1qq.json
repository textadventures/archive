I didn't think I had Quest  set to simple mode. But maybe I did. \r\n\r\nOne other question I have concerns names for objects. I have found that in instances where an object has two or more words in its name (e.g., Hot Dog Seller), each word is recognized separately as well as in combination. So the command to look at \"Hot\", \"Dog\", or \"Seller\" all work for the same object. I can see this making things a little messy  for me if I want to have multiple objects with similar names in one location. Is there a way to make only the full name acceptable?",
