It is basically an enclosed fence.\r\n\r\nI do not want the player to be able to open or close the pen, but it makes sense to give them that option to try it.  I cannot add a verb 'open/close' which makes the most sense to me because it conflicts with the built-in open/close.  I know I can edit 'built-in' responses but that won't work with multiple containers that I want to function normally.\r\n\r\nOnce I add the container feature, I must click on an option similar to 'can be open' and 'can be closed' because if I don't, the built-in version tells me that it cannot be open or closed when I try to do so.  If I do check the box, I can get the custom message to print, but now if I try to open it twice in a row, the built-in message rears it ugly head again and prints the built-in 'it's already open' message instead of my customized message.\r\n\r\nAnd to boot, whenever you change to a different type of container it does not wipe the old container attributes away, but stores them in the attributes which really gum up the effort.  Whenever I mess with a non-traditional container, I usually end up just deleting the whole thing and starting over.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat until I stumble on to a working solution or give up on it and pursue a different route.  \r\n\r\nI just want a container that responds to 'open [container]' with a customizeable message but will not trigger the built-in open object scripts.\r\n\r\nIt's late.  I'm rambling.  The answer is probably quite simple.",
