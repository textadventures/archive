Other things include making objects invisible (and visible), etc.\r\n\r\nThe code I posted should handle all of that.  You only need to create a Quest function for each interval, which will be called each time the interval fires.  You can script ANYTHING in that function.  It will be a Quest function, not an HTML function.\r\n\r\nYou could probably use a script dictionary attribute instead of creating a function for each interval, but it would be much more complicated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> I really don't want to have to go into the \"HTML\" coding style, because it feels clunky. \r\n\r\nYou wouldn't need to do that.  You would create a Quest function, putting whatever you want in the script.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> I also can't suppress scripts either.\r\n\r\nI don't understand what you mean, but I can be less vague about suppressing the turn scripts.\r\n\r\nEach time the player enters a command, 1 turn passes.\r\n\r\nIf an ASLEvent is called, it will cause an extra turn to pass, so every time 30 seconds went by and an interval fired, it would make 1 turn count as 2, which would upset the player if the turn count effected the game's outcome.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAnyway, I posted the best code I can think of, and I posted an example game to show how to use it.\r\n\r\nIf that won't work for you, hopefully someone else will drop in with a different suggestion.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and happy gaming!",
