I've used a on ready to wait for the player's input for the first menu, but it doesn't seem possible to make it wait for the player to finish choosing from the nested menu before running the code contained inside the on ready brackets. Wait sort of works, but it also ends up causing more problems.\r\n\r\nIs there an alternative way that I can do this?",
