I'm currently learning the tool but I encounter issues with pictures.\n\nI managed to display a picture one time, then it stop to work (I did not change the picture). I can just get a broken picture icon. I'm using the web version as I'm a mac user.\n\nI tried to create a new game, using the script &quot;picture&quot; or using the picture frame feature, same issue... It displays a broken icon.\n\nDid you change something on the server today?\n\nThanks for your help and sorry to post a topic for a so simple issue.\n\nDavid",
