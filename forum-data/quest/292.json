Run it, and it will accept connections via Telnet, and pass them on to QuestNet server. It does a bit of filtering so players will only see text that's meant for them, and it buffers text until you hit Enter so you don't get the annoying problem of having each character interpreted as a command. And because it listens on the default Telnet port, you can just run it and leave it there, with QuestNet running on its usual port.\n\nSo give it a whirl and let me know what you think.\n\nKnown issues:\n- Pressing backspace won't delete the text on-screen, but it will delete text in the buffer so ignore any stray characters you may see.\n- Menus are currently unsupported.\n- Logins aren't very nice (you have to type the username, then a semicolon, then the password - which will be displayed)\n- Any errors (e.g. name already in use) won't be particularly friendly (you'll just see the error code and text, no nice prompting) but they will at least be understandable.\n- Telnet users will all show up as being on 127.0.0.1 when you look at the Player info in QuestNet. This is because it sees the connection from the Adaptor, not the Telnet client. You can see the IP of the person connected via Telnet on the Adaptor screen though.\n\nYou can run several copies of the adaptor at once on several ports, all connected to the same QuestNet port - if you wanted to. You can also just set the adaptor up and leave it, even if you shut down QuestNet a lot, because the adaptor will make a fresh connection for each user. This also means you can start up the adaptor before or after starting QuestNet - whenever you like.\n\nThe adaptor may eventually be part of the normal QuestNet EXE file itself. Future versions of QuestNet will have better support for the adaptor - e.g. they might print the \"&gt;\" prompt properly etc. (which isn't done in the current version as the line would be printed twice - the adaptor just filters out lines beginning with a \"&gt;\" character).\n\nIf you have any questions, comments or suggestions please let me know.",
