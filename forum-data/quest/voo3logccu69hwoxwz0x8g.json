Some things such as libraries, defining functions and more complex scripting still elude me, but there's a lot that I can do with only what I currently have.\r\n\r\nMy question is that now that I have a grasp on the fundamentals, is there anything outside the tutorials that I should research in order to keep my game flexible enough to be modified in the future?\r\n\r\nFor example, I only just learned that it's common practice not to hard-code dialogue into a game. I'm not sure what you would do otherwise - use a library somehow? - but now that I know that I can research it and figure out how to implement it.\r\n\r\nAre there any other examples of things that will help to keep my game flexible that you guys can think of?",

This is to make it easier to port it to another language. It most games, the text is a tiny fraction of the code and so that is relatively easy to do. In Quest, the text pretty much is the game (or to look at it another way, what you create _is_ the dialogue, and is kept separate from the Quest code).",
