      "EditableText": "You could modify the &quot;defaultexit&quot; type (use the Filter button to show library elements, then copy it into your game), but then all exits would suddenly become script exits, so your script would have to move the player itself, and then any exit that was actually a script exit would override the script from the type.\n\nProbably a better idea would be to modify &quot;defaultplayer&quot; instead. This has a &quot;changedparent&quot; attribute which is a script that runs every time the player moves room - it's what prints the room description. You could add some code in there. All that code currently does is run the OnEnterRoom function, so alternatively you could modify that function instead.\n\n(In fact this might be a nice little Core library feature - it might be good to expose the ability to run a script every time the player changes room. The OnEnterRoom function could be updated to run a script attribute on the &quot;player&quot; object, which could be exposed via one of the CoreEditorObject*.aslx files to show a &quot;When the player moves&quot; script editor.)",
