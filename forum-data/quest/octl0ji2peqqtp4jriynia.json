I would like to move my games(they're set to unlisted) to a different account, as the one I'm currently on is affiliated with an e-mail and username I do not wish to use while sharing the games. I've downloaded the quest files, but when I attempt to upload them to the new account it tells me the game ID has already been submitted by another user, which is fair enough. However, I can't find an option to delete(or even unpublish!) the games from my current account. How should I go about doing this? Alternately, is there a way to change the display name on my account?",
