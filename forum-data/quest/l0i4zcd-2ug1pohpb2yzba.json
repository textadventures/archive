      "EditableText": "Yeah, very confusing. It will be just spot on sometimes, then massively fail on others. Sometimes if you specifically say \"search for solution from\" such and such places, or just generally anywhere, it will be of greater help. Also, sometimes saying \"I'm using Quest 5.8 to make a text adventure\" specifically, then it will perform better. With chat GPT plus, you can also create a custom GPT where you can upload example code (even your own aslx file), libraries, etc., and it will use them as a reference. And you can set the custom GPT for a specific purpose you specify, and it will know what you're talking about generally. I think they are starting to integrate some kind of memory into the model, so at some point it could learn from what you ask it (there is an option to opt out of using your questions/results as training data as well I think, don't quote me on that though). All in all, if you want to use it, prepare yourself for hours and hours of testing its code integrated into your own. In aggregate, its probably faster to just learn more about coding, or rely more on the forums. Turn to it when you're really in a pinch.",
