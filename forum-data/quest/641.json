Luckily, I was able to get into it through notepad and fix it up. But now that I have it back, another problem is occurring. Apparently, the too many thing caused everyone in the game to go mute. I don't even get the default response, but now I get an error message saying the command isn't even known. Is there anyone who might not mind trying to fix this, because I worked on it for four hours and could do nothing. And, while you're at it, you might as well beta test it, too <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
