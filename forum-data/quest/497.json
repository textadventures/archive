[/quote:2723yvw5]\n\nAlthough typelib's closable type wasn't really intended for doors between rooms, you can use it to do this in a number of ways, using one door object, two synchronised door objects or even use no door objects at all.\n\nHere's a demo of how to do it using typelib with the 'two synchronised doors' method (a method I quite like <!-- s:-) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:-) --> ).  Basically this means each room has its own door object (aliased to just 'door') and any open/close action you perform on one door is also applied by way of the open/close actions to the other door too. i.e. open the door in the lounge and the other door in the hall is also opened.  This gives the effect of a single door between the rooms.\n\nThe open/close actions are also used to create and destroy exits between the two rooms as required.

Basically this means each room has its own door object (aliased to just 'door') and any open/close action you perform on one door is also applied by way of the open/close actions to the other door too. i.e. open the door in the lounge and the other door in the hall is also opened.  This gives the effect of a single door between the rooms.<br/><br/>The open/close actions are also used to create and destroy exits between the two rooms as required. I'm relying on typelib's default open, close, already open, already closed messages here, but you can tailor those individually for either door - which looks to the player like either side of the same door - as required.<br/><br/>Here's the code.<br/><br/><pre><code>' &quot;door example&quot;<br/>' Created with QDK Pro 3&#46;52<br/><br/>!include &lt;Typelib&#46;qlb&gt;<br/><br/>define game &lt;door example&gt;<br/>\tasl-version &lt;350&gt;<br/>\tgametype singleplayer<br/>\tstart &lt;hallway&gt;<br/>\tgame author &lt;Al &#40;MaDbRiT&#41;&gt;<br/>\tgame info &lt;Created with QDK Pro 3&#46;52&gt;<br/>end define<br/><br/>define synonyms<br/>end define<br/><br/>define room &lt;hallway&gt;<br/>\tprefix &lt;the&gt;<br/><br/>\tdefine object &lt;halldoor&gt;<br/>\t\talias &lt;door&gt;<br/>\t\talt &lt;door&gt;<br/>\t\ttype &lt;TLTclosable&gt;<br/>\t\taction &lt;opened&gt; &#123;<br/>\t\t\tcreate exit north &lt;hallway; lounge&gt;<br/>\t\t\tcreate exit south &lt;lounge; hallway&gt;<br/>\t\t\tproperty &lt;loungedoor; not closed&gt;<br/>\t\t&#125;<br/>\t\taction &lt;closed&gt; &#123;<br/>\t\t\tcreate exit north &lt;hallway; &gt;<br/>\t\t\tcreate exit south &lt;lounge; &gt;<br/>\t\t\tproperty &lt;loungedoor; closed&gt;<br/>\t\t&#125;<br/>\tend define<br/><br/>end define<br/><br/>define room &lt;lounge&gt;<br/>\tprefix &lt;the&gt;<br/><br/>\tdefine object &lt;loungedoor&gt;<br/>\t\talias &lt;door&gt;<br/>\t\talt &lt;door&gt;<br/>\t\ttype &lt;TLTclosable&gt;<br/>\t\taction &lt;opened&gt; &#123;<br/>\t\t\tcreate exit north &lt;hallway; lounge&gt;<br/>\t\t\tcreate exit south &lt;lounge; hallway&gt;<br/>\t\t\tproperty &lt;halldoor; not closed&gt;<br/>\t\t&#125;<br/>\t\taction &lt;closed&gt; &#123;<br/>\t\t\tcreate exit north &lt;hallway; &gt;<br/>\t\t\tcreate exit south &lt;lounge; &gt;<br/>\t\t\tproperty &lt;halldoor; closed&gt;<br/>\t\t&#125;<br/>\tend define<br/><br/>end define<br/><br/>define text &lt;intro&gt;<br/><br/>end define<br/><br/>define text &lt;win&gt;<br/><br/>end define<br/><br/>define text &lt;lose&gt;<br/><br/>end define</code></pre><br/><br/><br/>Al (MaDbRiT)",

If something is inside another thing the immediately visible object in the room is the container, not the containable inside it. You see what's inside something by examining it - that's the way I coded typelib to work.\n\nIf the latter - then something is broken because unless the container is closed, you should be able to interact with containables inside it.\n\n[quote:269radi7]\nI'm practicing in a test game format where it's not really a game.

If something is inside another thing the immediately visible object in the room is the container, not the containable inside it.
