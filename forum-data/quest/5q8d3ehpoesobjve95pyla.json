However, this only works for the special 'game' Game Settings Object or Player Objects (such as the default 'player' Player Object).\r\n\r\nso, what that means is, we either need to add a statusattribute to (contained within) either: the special 'game' Game Settings Object or a Player Object.\r\n\r\nfor a game turn, it's most logical to use the special 'game' Game Settings Object, so we'll do that (and this way we don't have to click-on/switch-over to the 'player' Player Object)\r\n\r\nif you're not still viewing the 'Attributes' Tab of the special 'game' Game Settings Object: click on 'game' on the left side's 'tree of stuff' so it is highlighted and then on the right side, click on the 'Attributes' Tab.\r\n\r\nnow, for the 'status attributes' box (NOT the 'attributes' box and NOT the 'inherited attributes' box) -> Add -> (see below)\r\n\r\nName text box (this is our 'key'): turn // or whatever you named this Attribute as (see #1)\r\nField text box (this is our 'value'): Game Turns: ! // this will display during game play in the status pane on the right side: Game Turns: (the current 'game.turn' value)\r\n\r\nA stringdictionary Attribute is just an input-output(string input, string output) Function: the 'turn' is the input ('key'), and it's match up with the output ('value'): Game Turns: !, like this in its coding: turn = Game Turns: !, and thus it outputs: Game Turns: (current value of the'game.turn' Integer Attribute)\r\n\r\nalso, the '!' is a special command that GETS/displays the current value of the (in this example) 'game.turn' Integer Attribute\r\n\r\n3. lastly, we create a global (and enabled at game start) Turnscript for handling the updating (increasing) of our 'game.turn' Integer Attribute with every internal turn (any action you do: a typed-in input or a click on a hypertext or button/verb during game play):\r\n\r\nUnfortunately... the 'Turnscript' Element was accidentally left out it showing up in the left side's 'tree of stuff' (the Timer is there, but no Turnscript), and not sure if Pixie has fixed this up in quest version 560/570, or not.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can still easily access/create one:\r\n\r\nA. simply right click on the left side's 'tree of stuff', and the popup menu window will have the 'add turnscript' option for you.\r\nB. at the menu bar at the top of the screen (not sure what it's under), you can find the 'add turnscript' or something like that.\r\n\r\nthe turnscript added/created will be a global turnscript, which is what we want.\r\n(whereas, a local turnscript is a turnscript that is contained-within/added-to an Object)\r\n\r\nTurnscript Name text box: global_turnscript // or whatever you want to name it as\r\n\r\n'enabled' (called: enabled when game starts or something like this) checkbox: check it in (have it be checked in)\r\n\r\nand for its scripting (add new scripts):\r\n\r\n// blah add new scripts\r\n\r\n// last/bottom-most script:\r\nadd new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable game.turn = [EXPRESSION] game.turn + 1\r\n\r\n(I don't know the GUI/Editor's script options, so I \"cheat\" and use the '[EXPRESSION]' script option, so I can type in what I want)\r\n(there's probably some kind of 'increase counter' script option that you'd normally use for doing this.
