      "EditableText": "Sorry for the long title.  But I am curious what is the easiest technique, either for the short or long term, in creating a text adventure.  I have a game I built almost to completion, but I am curious what the majority of authors do.  Do you guys create a room and add all possible elements to it that you could think up at least at the time- lengthy descriptions, puzzles, etc. before moving onto the next room and repeat the process?  Or do you map out your game with rooms first and then go back and fill it with descriptions, puzzles, etc.?\r\n\r\nMy game was basic, although I like to think of it as having some surprising elements, especially for a first game.  But I am not sure if I were to make it more complicated (The first in the series would not be.) how that would affect it using Quest.  I am not sure how coding works or the \"skeleton\" check mark boxes of Quest that affects the entire game and if it would quite possibly break it if the focus of one aspect was added too late.  I know I had working roving NPCs, thanks to a person in the forums, but it broke once Quest was updated.  So I am a bit leery on how to do things in Quest with the possibility of breaking something.   Thank you.",

      "EditableText": "For me, I create the story first in Word / similar, adding in the key beats and set pieces and likely scenarios which would make cool encounters or puzzles to solve.\r\n\r\nThen I create the map for the game world in Excel / similar - places I know for sure I want the player to visit. This seems to come naturally based on the plot.\r\n\r\nThen I put in the key puzzles before I even write any descriptions - ideas I'm sure I want to implement. My current adventure, I knew I wanted the opening scene to be an escape room kind of thing, i.e. several puzzles based around scenery and inventory manipulation that you need to solve before you even get access to the full map. This was inspired by openings such as those from Broken Sword II and Escape from Monkey Island.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has gotten outside, I knew I wanted them to have to retrieve a certain item from a certain place to progress, and I knew based on where I placed that item that the player would need to fashion their own tool to retrieve it, so I set about creating an interesting set up for that to happen. I wrote in all the object descriptions and all the flags and play-tested the puzzle in full before I'd even done location descriptions for the places the player would need to go.\r\n\r\nThen I went back through those locations, added sounds and pictures and descriptions, and fleshed them out until I felt they were 'complete' from a gameplay perspective. Once I'd done all that, I went back through those locations again, and added a lot of colour to bring the world to life and make it feel more tactile and tangible. So for example, lets say I had a woodland clearing and I'd set up several items to help the puzzle along, and I'd finished it from the point of view of the actual gameplay. I would go back and added a load of scenery items that match with the description - a fence, the grass, clouds, sky, leaves, trees, the hilltops beyond, a building on the horizon. Each of those would have their own 'examine' description, simply to add some depth to the world.\r\n\r\nOnce I'm happy that's done, I'd move on to the next batch of puzzles and locations :)",
