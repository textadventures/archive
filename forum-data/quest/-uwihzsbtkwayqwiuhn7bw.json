I'd like the first one to be accessed if you know the right word. \r\n\r\n2. For the others if you bring the NPC the correct object, they will give you the one they are holding.  If not they refuse. \r\n\r\nFor number one I think I need to make it a locked container, but I'm not sure how to make a passphrase into a key. I also want to make sure the object can be taken from that container, but no object can be placed inside it. \r\n\r\nFor giving the object in number two something like\r\nif object =pearl\r\nadd pearl to chest\r\nprint you hand over the pearl\r\nif object /= pearl\r\nprint What do I want with that?\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I need something like below for taking an object\r\nif pearl is in chest\r\n    add sword to inventory\r\n    print you obtain the sword\r\nif pearl is not in chest\r\n    print you can't take that!\r\n\r\n\r\nMostly I'm not sure of the syntax I should use for these.  Any help would be much appreciated!\r\n",
