It's probably very easy, but I can't figure it out.\n\nI want to make a big box with crackers in it (for a puzzle involoving a parrot). The player can take a cracker from the box and he needs it to complete the puzzle, but he can also lose the cracker without completing it (for instance by simply eating it himself).\nI want the player to be able to take a cracker from the box over and over again until he has completed the puzzle.\nThe only way I can think of to do this is by making a very large amount of &quot;cracker&quot; objects and make them invisible, but there's probably a much simpler way.",
