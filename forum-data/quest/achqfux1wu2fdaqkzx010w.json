I tried submitting it with Quest as a secondary install, but they denied that straight-up - games have to be self-contained .exes. I've gone through QuestJS, but my game is so large that it would literally take weeks of work to convert properly, most likely. I just want to be able to convert my game into a format that isn't so locked behind the Quest engine, if someone can help me with QuestJS or something else it would be greatly appreciated",
