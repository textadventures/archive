I'm very new to looking at coding languages.\r\nI have a sequential puzzle in my game where you need to put utensils into their correct spot on a table setting before a tea pot will open its lid and reveal the next piece of a key for the player.  I made it so that every time a player put the correct utensil in its corresponding spot, the utensil would become invisible and then after all of the utensils become invisible, a message would appear and a key fragment would then be added to the players inventory. I don't how to write a statement that would basically say: If fork(1), fork (2), and fork (3) are invisible then print message and add key to inventory. Else print different message. ",
