I go to the Attributes tab, at the bottom, and add an attribute called &quot;turns.&quot; I then make it an integer (its default was string). \n\nSo then I go to the &quot;status attribute&quot; at the top of the attribute tab and I added another, and called it &quot;turns&quot; as per the instructions. \n\nSo then it created a &quot;statusattribute      turns= &quot; and then underneath that I can see &quot;turns     0&quot;\n\nThis is the exact same as the tutorial. Both are &quot;source&quot; - &quot;player&quot;. \n\nIt then tells me to launch the game, and I'm supposed to see &quot;turns&quot; on the right-hand side. . . I do not. So I perform some actions. . . many actions, but nothing is there. I see Inventory, objects, compass in that order from top-bottom. \n\nSo I delete everything and start over again. Same outcome. \n\nI went ahead and created the turn script, as it instructed in the tutorial, even though I saw nothing on the right pane. I made it a global turn script, and it simply says &quot;player.turns&quot; -- &quot;player.turns + 1&quot;. I did that thinking it would force the pane to appear, but it didn't. \n\nSo I then went to &quot;game&quot; and then to the &quot;player&quot; tab. I added the attributes there. \n\nAnd it worked! Initially, it had two sets of &quot;Turns=0&quot; and then right under that it said &quot;turns&quot; . . . So I went through the attributes and deleted them until I deleted the one that created the &quot;turns&quot; without an integer value to the right of it, so then I was left with &quot;Turns=0&quot;. . . . but, even with the global turn script. . . that number WILL not change. \n\nSo I deleted it all and tried it again using the &quot;player&quot; that was created initially. I even tried tweaking the player by having it able to be taken over by player, etc. . . but none of that works. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong???",
