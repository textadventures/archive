      "EditableText": "The expression parser doesn't seem to be able to deal with non-ASCII characters (or whatever code page it happens to be) in things like object and variable names. But as long as you don't mind not having *internal* names with Chinese characters, then the solution is simple: use working characters for all your object *names* but set the visible *alias* for the object to what you want. The player will see the alias instead of the name if you give it one.\n\nFor example, if your object name is &quot;door&quot; but the alias is &quot;大门&quot;, then you'd use &quot;door&quot; while scripting, but the player will see &quot;大门&quot;.\n\nIn my test, the characters show up fine when displayed, so Quest seems to have *general* support for them. (I assume, given that the game files are XML-based, it's something like UTF-8.) It's just the FLEE expression parser that appears to choke.\n\nI hope that helps.",
