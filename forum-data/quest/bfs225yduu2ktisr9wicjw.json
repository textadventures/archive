On the website sometimes there seem to be bugs or lag resulting in slow-reaction time and somedays features just don't work at all. \r\n\r\nI really like how easy the downloaded version of Quest is to use and the great community behind it that makes navigating the program so much easier. This is why I'm reluctant to switch to a new engine. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this question has been answered before, but it'd be amazing if someone could tell me where Quest is at letting games have their own separate server to prevent lag or how to accomplish that on my own.\r\n\r\n(A while ago I did hear rumours of a new Quest update or version coming, but I'm not sure where it stands right now)",
