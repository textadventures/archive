You use the script to control whether the player can go through, not the \"locked\" attribute.\r\n\r\nIf there's multiple options, your code will end up getting quite complex, with lots of 'if' statements. But there may be a quicker way. If you are using the default wearables system, you can use the `worn` attribute to get a list of all worn items. So your script might be something like:\r\n```\r\nclothes = FilterByAttribute (ScopeInventory(), \"worn\", true)\r\nif (ListCount (clothes) < 1) {\r\n  msg (\"You can't go out naked.\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  MovePlayer (this.to)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want the player to be wearing multiple garments (shirt and trousers, maybe), you could change the number `1` in that script to something higher, the minimum number of garments. Or if you're using \"slots\" on the wearables tab? If so, you can use the function `GetOuterFor` to check if the player is wearing anything in a particular slot. In that case, the script would be something like:\r\n<pre><code>my naked = NewStringList()\r\nforeach (slot, Split(\"<b style=\"font-family: initial; color: blue;\">chest;legs</b>\")) {\r\n  if (GetOuterFor (game.pov, slot) = null) {\r\n    list add (naked, slot)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nif (ListCount (naked) = 0) {\r\n  MovePlayer (this.to)\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You can't go out naked!

You can change the list of slots that the player needs to cover; and change the message based on how you have named your slots.)",
