      "EditableText": "You have two options in the text processor: `{either` and `{if`.\r\n\r\nThe structure is:\r\n<pre><code>{if <em style=\"font-family: initial; color: green;\">attribute</em>=<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: blue;\">value</em>:<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: orange;\">Some text that appears if the condition is true.</em>}</code></pre>\r\nIn this case, the attribute is can either be an attribute with a dot (such as `player.health` or `page7.visited`), or an attribute of the game object (such as Gamebook mode's flags and counters). The value is assumed to be a literal string, and the attribute is converted to a string before comparison. This means that you can't compare two attributes to each other.\r\n\r\nYou can use `=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<>`, `>`, or `<`. You can also put `not` in front of the variable name.\r\n\r\nThe other option:\r\n<pre><code>{either <em style=\"font-family: initial; color: purple;\">condition</em>:<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: green;\">Text to show if it's true.</em>:<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: brown;\">Text to show if its false.</em>}</code></pre>\r\nIn this case, <em style=\"font-family: initial; color: purple;\">condition</em> can be anything you could use as the condition in a normal `if` statement. It can be something like `player.alias = \"Bob\"`, or `player.strength > player.intelligence`, or even `ListContains (player.achievements, \"BAMF\")`. You can use Quest functions in it, and do whatever you want, as long as your condition returns `true` or `false`.",
