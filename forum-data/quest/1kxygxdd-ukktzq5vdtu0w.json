(or maybe quest is programmed to present a popup menu of the two commands and you select one)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<command name=\"hi_command\">\r\n  <pattern>example</pattern>\r\n  <script>\r\n    msg (\"hi\")\r\n  </script\r\n</command>\r\n\r\n<command name=\"bye_command\">\r\n  <pattern>example</pattern>\r\n  <script>\r\n    msg (\"bye\")\r\n  </script\r\n</command>\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nabout a Command's pattern's usage of Parameters:\r\n\r\n#object# or #objectXXX#\r\nor\r\n#text# or #textXXX#\r\n\r\nthe hash/pound symbol tells quest and its string/input parsing that the person's typed-in input at this location in the pattern, will be stored into a Parameter of the same name (minus the hash/pound symbols)\r\n\r\nmy 'XXX' means you can extend its name as whatever you want:\r\n\r\nbut you MUST have: '#object' or '#text', first, and last: '#'\r\n\r\nvalid examples:\r\n#text#\r\n#text_parameter#\r\n#text1#\r\n#text2#\r\netc etc etc\r\n\r\n#object#\r\n#object_parameter#\r\n#object1#\r\n#object2#\r\n\r\ninvalid examples:\r\n\r\n#Atext#\r\n#teAxt#\r\n\r\n#Aobject#\r\n#objAect#\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nand then the actually Parameter used by/in the scripting would be, for example:\r\n\r\n(you can use as many Parameters as you want, and you can use both '#object#' and '#text#' together too in your pattern)\r\n\r\n(and you can use a semicolon, to have as many patterns as you want too, but you must start:left-most with the most complex pattern to the least complex pattern)\r\n\r\n```\r\n// examples of typed-in inputs:\r\nmix frog with silk and honey\r\nmix frog with silk\r\nmix frog\r\nmix\r\n\r\n<command name=\"example_of_a_complex_command\">\r\n  <pattern>mix #object_parameter_1# with #text_parameter_1# and #object_parameter_2; mix #object_parameter_1# with #text_parameter_1#; mix #object_parameter_1#; mix</pattern>\r\n  <script>\r\n    // too much work for trying to come up with some realistic scripting, so instead I'm just doing the below, to show how you use the Parameters in the scripting (simple example, not dealing with handling the complex issues involved --- too much work):\r\n    msg (object_parameter_1.alias)\r\n    msg (text_parameter_1)\r\n    msg (object_parameter_2.alias)\r\n  </script>\r\n</command>\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n'#text#' Pattern just stores a typed-in input as a string/text into your 'text' String Parameter\r\n\r\nyou can then see if that text/string is an existing Object (get that Object reference/pointer for use if it exists), via for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// using: #text_parameter#\r\n\r\nif (HasObject (text_parameter)) {\r\n  object_variable = GetObject (text_parameter)\r\n  msg (object_variable.alias)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nwhereas, the #object#, will automatically check/get if your typed-in input is an existing Object (it'll check for Object's 'name' and 'alias' if it matches up with your typed-in input), BUT it'll only check the Objects in the same room as you are... so, such an Object can indeed exist, but it's not found, as it's not in the same room as you are. You got to do additional coding to look for a matching Object outside of the same room as you're in. So, for needing to check/get an Object anywhere in the game, using the '#text#' is better, as you can use the 'HasObject' and 'Getobject' Functions for this.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nI'm sure I just confused you even more... I tried to explain about Commands in a very-non organized way... they're hard to explain, and need some planning/organization to explain them clearly/well.\r\n\r\n(Pixie's post above/before this one of mine, explains all this clearly/concisely, as usual)\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nask if you got any questions and/or need any help.",

      "EditableText": "hegemonkhan,\r\n\r\nI feel the same way you do about blockbusters. I seldom enjoy any form of 'art' that attempts to pander to the masses. (I may be mistaken, but I believe \"Bro-mances\" were the first films of that sort. Ugh! Everything just worsened from there. But I digress...)\r\n\r\nI didn't mean to bash Inform in my earlier post, either. I picked up on Inform 7-ese very quickly. Their IDE is pretty sweet, too. Being able to compile to Z-machine and Glulx is also a big plus. The option to include a website is also fantastic, but that's where it becomes a little difficult to customize things.\r\n\r\nThey have a few different extensions and interpreters to choose from that will make it easier to format your text output for HTML, but I still ended up learning some HTML, CSS, and (very little) Java to make my game look like I wanted it. (Like the command prompt: I customized the Rye font so that the \">\" is displayed as a revolver pointing to your command. I was about to try to learn how to create buttons that would send commands to the parser, like Draculaland and Detectiveland, then I remembered that Quest has an option for that already built-in! Anyway. . . (I digress alot.)\r\n\r\nThe Simple Followers extension in Inform 7 was written by Emily Short. (I think. I am also too lazy to conduct quick searches sometimes. She wrote the majority of the extensions, so I'm gonna be adventurous and bet that it was her.) It would be problematic to change the way the game reports the NPCs entering the location in Inform, to say the least. I was worried less about the redundancy and more about the text filling up the screen with every move.\r\n\r\nThere is a point where 4 or 5 NPCs are following you, too. And some of them can't go everywhere you can go. When this is the case, said NPC takes the most direct route possible from their location to your location.

(I may be mistaken, but I believe \"Bro-mances\" were the first films of that sort. Ugh! Everything just worsened from there. But I digress...)</p>\n<p>I didn't mean to bash Inform in my earlier post, either. I picked up on Inform 7-ese very quickly. Their IDE is pretty sweet, too. Being able to compile to Z-machine and Glulx is also a big plus. The option to include a website is also fantastic, but that's where it becomes a little difficult to customize things.</p>\n<p>They have a few different extensions and interpreters to choose from that will make it easier to format your text output for HTML, but I still ended up learning some HTML, CSS, and (very little) Java to make my game look like I wanted it. (Like the command prompt: I customized the Rye font so that the \"&gt;\" is displayed as a revolver pointing to your command. I was about to try to learn how to create buttons that would send commands to the parser, like Draculaland and Detectiveland, then I remembered that Quest has an option for that already built-in! Anyway. . . (I digress alot.)</p>\n<p>The Simple Followers extension in Inform 7 was written by Emily Short. (I think. I am also too lazy to conduct quick searches sometimes. She wrote the majority of the extensions, so I'm gonna be adventurous and bet that it was her.) It would be problematic to change the way the game reports the NPCs entering the location in Inform, to say the least.
