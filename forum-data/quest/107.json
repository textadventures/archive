Um, this sort of thing, saving character progress/changes/etc isn't a QuestNet issue but a coding issue. You can easily code a way to save characters progress and information and such, [b:he5wke4a]BUT[/b:he5wke4a], what isn't yet implemented is a way to make the server save changes to the file that runs the game(it wouldn't really be the same file, Alex has mentioned that he plans on using a process similar to the qsg*right?* files that are used for single player games). \n\nSO BASICALLY... You can save all the progress, and everything people do in your game for as long as you want. You could have a completely persistent world, but as soon as you close QuestNet Server, everything would be gone(the file would be exactly the same as it originally was coded, no changes). \n\nThis is the only reason I don't have a persistent world going(I used to rape my bandwidth, but now that's not an issue).\n\nP.S. I would REALLY, [b:he5wke4a]REALLY[/b:he5wke4a] love to host a persistent world for these forums(ie; the users/developers). I think about doing it constantly, just a small city, mobs to hunt, basic character progression(levels, skills, spells, crafting... all simplistic but open) in an OOC(out of character) context, but I doubt many people would use or enjoy it(I could make it enjoyable, but you know what I mean). Eh, maybe I'll post about it seperately, if it gets a good response I could work on it, if people are enthusiastic we may even be able to convince Alex to develop a beta build with a greater than 3 limitation(for only this use), OR, to figure a way to host a build like that for this little community or whatever.",
