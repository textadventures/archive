I've tried to find the answer in the Quest Wiki and in this forum, but I'm afraid I haven't found it as yet.\n\nIn a Quest script, what command can I use to stop the script from executing at some particular point? This command would be the equivalent of &quot;stop the action&quot; in Inform 7.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nPeace,\nBrendan Desilets",
