I was wondering is it possible in either Text Adventure or Gamebooks to end the game by letting the user enter data by typing. \r\nExample: along your quest you get parts of a code, which combined form the final code you have to enter to finish the game. \r\n\r\nI have an idea in my mind, but don't know if I have to create a text adventure or gamebook for it\r\n\r\nThank you!",
