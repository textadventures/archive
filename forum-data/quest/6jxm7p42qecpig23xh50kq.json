We have been recommend the Genarrator website but I personally can't get along with it so I have decided to use Quest Gamebook. I'm really happy with it so far but I have a problem.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm using the continuous flow option as opposed to 'Clear page' so my story scrolls.\r\n\r\nthe problem I'm having is that when the page scrolls, it scrolls down further than is needed which cuts off images and leaves a gap underneath my text.\r\n\r\nIs there a way of working around this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRicky",
