I have, however, managed to make it where when I enter a room, the NPC will say something after a random amount of time using the &quot;GetRandomInt(x,y)&quot; syntax. The problem is, once she has said the message, it does not repeat unless I reenter the room. Is there any way to make it so she will repeat it at random times indefinitely? I'd like it based on time over turns as I want her to seem completely seperate from the player's actions. Could anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nThanks for reading! <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
