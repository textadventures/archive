      "EditableText": "So this isn't a real problem, more just a request for the explanation and function of this feature.  I'm just curious as to how the script of playing YouTube videos works.  I clicked on the script to check it out, and the drop down menu allowed me to choose &quot;ID&quot;.  What does this mean?  What do I type into it in relation to the video in question?  And one more question, if I want to put a YouTube video into my script to play something, say, before my character enters a room or building for the first time (such as a video of machinery being used in a car repair shop), will it open a link to the video, or will the video actually play in the text adventure itself?  An answer to all this would be appreciated, and as I'm new to using Quest, try to keep it simple and just give me a step-by-step of how to use this feature.\n(EDIT):  Honestly the reason I want to know, is because I want to see how a text adventure adaption of the game Silent Hill 2 would be.  I'd be putting the sound bytes in for their respective actions (opening a map, monster noises, etc.).  Truthfully, I could just set it up so the cutscenes would be in mp3 form, but I think using a video would be cooler.",
