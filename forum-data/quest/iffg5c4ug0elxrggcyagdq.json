This is about the only part of the .NET framework which is not supported on WINE, and probably never will be.

Actually, just don't use WPF ever because it sucks.\"\r\n\r\nOddly enough, on the WINE forums the requests for WPF support _only_ seem to come from people who want to use Quest on linux. The guys behind Mono have said they have no plans to add WPF support because it's unpopular, difficult to work with, and obsolete (in favour of Silverlight). It seriously looks like Quest is the only WPF app out there, so nobody's likely to put in the huge effort necessary to make it run under Linux just for us.\r\n\r\nI have considered translating the Quest core to another language; which would be a very large project, but not unmanageable. But don't count on it happening any time soon, as the majority of my time has to be devoted to things I can actually get paid for.",
