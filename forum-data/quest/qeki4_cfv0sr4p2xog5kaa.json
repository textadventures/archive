      "EditableText": "Hello, all! I apologize for what is probably a very easy question, but I have dug around through all of the resources that I know of for an answer to my problem, and, unfortunately, I am coming up empty. The last time I have touched code was BASIC back in 1985, so I'm kind of stuck using the GUI. I am trying to make an IF version of a real world escape room that I have designed, and so far I've gotten around a few hurdles, and it's been a fun ride.\r\n\r\nYet for some reason I seem unable to manipulate the \"UNLOCK\" command. \r\n\r\nHere is what I am attempting to do: As this is an escape room, there will be some boxes with combinations on them. I have used the forums and guides to figure that part out, and I even added a script checking if the player has found the clue that will give them the code (I just figured object flags would be fine for that part). So now, whenever the player \"LOOK\"s at the box in its original state, they get one of two responses - if they found the clue then they can immediately attempt the combo; if they haven't found the clue yet then they have the option of guessing. I put this all into a function for ease of use, and it works perfectly fine. \r\n\r\nThat all being said... I have no idea how to make this script work for when the player types \"UNLOCK BOX\". Right now it only works for \"LOOK AT BOX\". I imagine that this is a simple fix that I am overlooking, but for the life of me I do not know how to make the \"UNLOCK\" command for this object alone call my custom function.\r\n\r\nWhat I've done so far is mark the box as a lockable container with 1 key needed to unlock. I humorously discovered that if the number of keys was 0 then the player could simply type \"UNLOCK BOX\" and poof, lock bypassed! But aside from that, I don't know what else I can do with the \"lock\" portion of the container tab.\r\n\r\nAny insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!",
