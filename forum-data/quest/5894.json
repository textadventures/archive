I'm initially thinking some kind of script on the object itself which tags &quot;There's a *object* here.&quot; onto the end of the room description, but can't think how that might be done off the top of my head.\n\nIt's not an emergency by any means, because the responsibility for remembering where an object was dropped could be given to the player, and you could argue that if they drop it they don't want it anyway. It just seems a bit illogical to not have it in the description if it's there.",
