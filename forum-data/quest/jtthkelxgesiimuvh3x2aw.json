It doesn't know where to draw the room relative to the existing ones.\r\n\r\nI believe in the manual, there is a script which will explore the map and draw it all in, to cure this error.\r\n\r\nOne alternative would be a script like:\r\n<pre><code>Grid_SetGridCoordinateForPlayer (game.pov, <em style=\"color: blue\">name of room</em>, \"x\", 0.0)\r\nGrid_SetGridCoordinateForPlayer (game.pov, <em style=\"color: blue\">name of room</em>, \"y\", 0.0)\r\nGrid_SetGridCoordinateForPlayer (game.pov, <em style=\"color: blue\">name of room</em>, \"z\", 0.0)\r\ngame.pov.parent = <em style=\"color: blue\">name of room</em></code></pre>\r\n\r\nThis way, you're positioning the room on the map. If it is accessible from the old room, you need to make sure the coordinate is  right; if the new location can only be reached by script movement, you could just make a big number (like 1000 or something) for one of the values.\r\n\r\n(In this script I used `game.pov` rather than `player` because it always works and is a good habit to get into)",
