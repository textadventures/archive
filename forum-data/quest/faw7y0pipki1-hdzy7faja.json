A little over-complex, but I think it's more stable.\r\n```\r\n<function name=\"MakeNumberSequence\" type=\"stringlist\">\r\n  numbers_not_used = Split (\"1;2;3;4;5\")\r\n  result = NewStringList()\r\n  for (i, 1, 5) {\r\n    next_number = PickOneString (numbers_not_used)\r\n    list remove (numbers_not_used, next_number)\r\n    list add (result, next_number)\r\n  }\r\n  if (HasAttribute (game, \"used_number_sequences\")) {\r\n    while (ListContains (game.used_number_sequences, Join(result, \"\"))) {\r\n      PermuteNumberSequence(result)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    game.used_number_sequences = NewStringList()\r\n  }\r\n  list add (game.used_number_sequences, Join(result, \"\"))\r\n  return (result)\r\n</function>\r\n\r\n<function name=\"PermuteNumberSequence\" parameters=\"sequence\">\r\n  change = PickOneString (sequence)\r\n  list remove (sequence, change)\r\n  list add (sequence, change)\r\n</function>\r\n```\r\nMakeNumberSequence() returns a number sequence, a stringlist with 5 elements. It puts the sequences it has generated into a stringlist attribute, and checks against them to make sure it doesn't pick the same sequence twice. If it finds a duplicate, it calls PermuteNumberSequence, which takes a randomly selected item out of the list and moves it to the end. This takes slightly less than a fifth of the time that generating a whole new sequence would take, and I think it has the same chance of generating a non-matching one.\r\n\r\n(Actually, it's not going to be that slow; because if you generated 8 number sequences at random, there'd be a 78.7% chance of them all being different)\r\n\r\n**Alternate method**\r\n\r\nIf you were looking for more sequences, I'd suggest making a list of *all* the different sequences of 5 digits. There's 3125 possible sets of 5 digits from 1 to 5; of which only 120 contain all 5 digits in some order. So it wouldn't take too long for a computer to make a list of all 120, and then you can just pick one at random from the list. If you remove it from the list when you've used it, then you know you'll get all different ones.\r\n\r\nSomething like (off the top of my head, not yet tested):\r\n```\r\n<function name=\"GetUniqueNumberSequence\" type=\"string\">\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    game.unused_number_sequences = NewStringList()\r\n    done = false\r\n    output = \"\"\r\n    number_to_add = 1\r\n    can_remove = false\r\n    while (not done) {\r\n      output = output + \" \" + ToString(number_to_add)\r\n      if (LengthOf(output) = 10) {\r\n        list add (game.unused_number_sequences, Right (output, 9))\r\n        can_remove = true\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n        number_to_add = 1\r\n      }\r\n      while (can_remove or Instr(output, ToString(number_to_add)) > 0) {\r\n        if (can_remove) {\r\n          number_to_add = ToInt (Right (output, 1))\r\n          output = Left (output, LengthOf(output) - 2)\r\n          can_remove = false\r\n        }\r\n        if (number_to_add = 5) {\r\n          if (output = \"\") {\r\n            done = true\r\n          }\r\n          else {\r\n            can_remove = true\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n          number_to_add = number_to_add +1\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  result = PickOneString (game.unused_number_sequences)\r\n  list remove (game.unused_number_sequences, result)\r\n  return (result)\r\n</function>\r\n```",
