      "EditableText": "I second what Jay and TinFoil said.  Simplify/streamline player options with items.  There is no need to look away from an object, unless you 'freeze' your character after gazing into, let's say, Saruman's staff.  Then, that might make sense, but for what I see you doing with your game, it is not a necessary command.\n\nAlso, there are a few grammar things that are easy enough to clear up - to, too, sitting and cobble, namely.  I think there were 4 misspelled words in the cottage description.\n\nI don't know if you plan on using any or all of those things, especially those in the opening room, but if not, I would try and limit the number of objects that appear in the Items window to the right.  At one point there are nine items in the window pane and you can only really interact with one of them.  I would consider marking those items as &quot;scenery&quot; (I think that's what it is) so the player can still look at them if they choose, but are not necessary to the game - or, that you want to use them to give clues in their 'look at' description to a particular puzzle.\n\nIn my first game, I had the window pane visible during game play, but in game two I am definitely not making that an option.  There were some bugs I had noticed in my first game when players opted to use the item/inventory panes instead of typing.  I prefer to not have the panes when I play because I think it sometimes offers too many 'hints' as to what to do with those objects, or more likely (in my games) gives a jumble of options that I only really intend for the sarcastic gamer that want to kiss a troll, or kill an ogre with a wet noodle.  Either way, consider getting rid of the panes if it would work for you.  These options are available in the game tab in the GUI.\n\nAlso, if you plan on having instructions for spells, especially those that are lengthy like that first one, it would be a good idea to either allow the player to take the spell page or to create a journal item that copies the spell description in a journal that the player could carry around.  This isn't too hard to do.  If you have questions about that, ask.\n\nYou do a better job than most it appears with giving descriptions to the things that players can look at, but I LOVE it (LOVE IT) when authors take the time to add scenery objects that give a response when a player looks at them.  Example, 'look at trees' or 'look at path' gives an &quot;I can't see that&quot; response, but it SAYS there are scraggly trees and a path in the description.  Obviously, this is not a game design thing, but more of a player preference thing.  It gives depth and freedom to the world you are trying to create.\n\nAll-in-all, I think you certainly have the correct idea on how to write a TA - your setting is good and there is already a 'classic feel' for the short bit you have offered.  As you continue to fiddle around with Quest, you'll find ways to accomplish what you want with minimal interference.  I'd suggest that you continue to tinker with it and when you come across an issue that you can't solve or just needing advice on things, post it to the forum.  The people here are incredibly helpful in  ironing out the issues that new game designers have (I would know, trust me!!!).\n\nIf you get a chance, play 'Xanadu - the World's Only Hope' and let me know what you think!\n\nHappy gaming.  And if you have questions, please ask.  I look forward to your finished product.\n\nXanMag",

'change 'grab up...' to simply 'grab' when moving into the garden and picking up the knife.  Actually, why don't you put the knife in the desk or somewhere in the garden and force the player to find it and pick it up?  Maybe put it in the chest in the bedroom?\n3.  I'll assume the chopping block is not a complete item yet?  It tells me it is nothing out of the ordinary.  I'd at least have a simple description in the 'look at' box for now.  If you don't want to add a 'use' command to it, that's fine since the game is in beta.  Just an FYI.\n4.  When using the pump, the word 'leaved' is in there.  I think your intent was 'lever' maybe?\n5.  After you use the pump and you 'x water' or 'get water' there are two water options that pop up.  I'm not sure where the second water came from or why the second water is there?  Actually, this happens with the herbs as well.  For giggles, I tried to put the herbs in the chest in the bedroom, and I constantly get a couple different herb option that I think are identical.  I think I know the issue here because I had the same with my berry in the desert =).  When taking the thyme, for example, I would have a script that moves the thyme to the inventory AND a flag that goes up.  Maybe name it 'thymetaken'.  If the player tries to take more thyme, have an 'If' message that says something like 'You already have thyme and you need no more.'  If the player does not have the flag 'thymetaken' then add it to the inventory.  If the thyme is used or eaten, simply unset the flag so the thyme can be taken again.  The other option is to add an 'If' statement that checks if thyme is in the player inventory and disallow it to be taken again if it is.  If you do this, you may need to make the thyme undroppable, which may be a hassle.  You could also make the bundle a surface container.  If the thyme is removed, the surface container (in this case, the bundle of hanging herbs) will no longer contain thyme.  If the player destroys the thyme, simply move the thyme back to the parent container 'bundle of hanging herbs'. Then, you could go back and take them again.  Forgive me, however, I cannot fully remember what you named the dried herbs that are hanging up.  Or, since there is an herb plot in the garden, you could force the player to pick fresh thyme and then use it with the pot/fire to dry it out?  Any of these three options should work.  This should eliminate any of the multiple waters or herbs that are popping up.  Other coders may come along and give you a code you could copy-paste to make it easier, but this is what I would do.\n6.  Add a command for 'drink water'.  It seems reasonable enough, right?  So, just allow the player to drink the water or maybe add a response like 'you are not thirsty' or 'the water doesn't look clean enough to drink, but you could use it to water the plot.'  Then, you could move the water 'object' back to the trough once used.\n7.  Will catching a chicken be possible?  I tried to get chicken but it said I have to catch one first.  I assume at some point later in an updated game that I will be able to or need to catch one?  If not, then please remove the 'you have to catch one first' because it will just confuse the player and waste their time trying to do things to catch a chicken that wasn't catchable in the first place =)\n\nBedroom...\n1.  floor --&gt; make scenery as you did in the other room.  The floor is showing up in the places and object pane and I don't think you intended it to because it's not there in the other rooms (I think).\n\nGeneral...\n1.  Make sure you have periods at the end of your sentences, especially noticeable in the 'x object' descriptions.  Minor.\n2.  I enjoyed the added description and the sounds.  Added sounds are very underrated in my opinion.  It pulls me in more.  I use <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.freesound.org/browse/\">http://www.freesound.org/browse/</a><!-- m --> for the noises I am using in my second game.  Good stuff in there.  But, if you use them as often as you seem on planning to use them, be prepared to spend some time searching/adding sound.  I like it a lot, but just be prepared!\n3.  All in all... much better.
