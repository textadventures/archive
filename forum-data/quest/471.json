      "EditableText": "I wouldn't mind a swap command either.  However, there is a more complex way to do this.  What you need are two objects: one called \"vicious rats\", the other called \"sleepy rats\".  When the game starts, make the sleepy rats invisible.  Once you feed the rats, show the sleepy rats and make the vicious ones invisible.  Also, set a flag to on.  Now make it so that when you try to take the object, check if the flag is on.  If so, give the object to the player.\n\nThat's one way of doing things, and yes, the ability to change the name of an object mid-game, or a swap command, would be great too.\n\nGlad I could help",
