I am having a few problems with this scene:\n\n1) I attempted to have it so that the exit into the next area would be locked until the player obtained all three items into their inventory, but couldn't figure out how exactly. \n\n2) I want it so the metal fragment is invisible until the player picks up both of the other items first. The player would &quot;notice&quot; the third and final item after picking up both of the others. I want Quest to &quot;list&quot; it within the text and not just in the &quot;Places and Objects&quot; section of the HUD.\n\nForgive me if I am not making much sense with what I am saying, I am still relatively new to all this and find myself a little overwhelmed.",

If true, make the metal fragment visible by clicking 'Make object visible'.  If not, do nothing. Do the same for the lunch, if player has pole, make metal visible, and if not, do nothing. Oh, when setting up the metal, remember to untick the 'Visible' box.",
