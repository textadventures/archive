Stuff it never did when I would play through, checking it in the editor.\r\nI created the game offline...so, not sure if that has anything to do with it or not.\r\n\r\nFirst issue I notice right away, is that every time I move from one room to another it adds in these lines. \r\n( please see the image linked below)\r\n\r\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVzqqCCz/lines01.jpg\r\n\r\nI have no idea where they are coming from.\r\n\r\nSecond issue I noticed when playing a short way in...is that when entering a room...you meet a person that say's a certain thing. You leave the room and come back...this person is supposed to say something different. ( I use flags to do this) It works fine when testing it in the editor. However, now uploaded and in the browser, it repeats what was said the first time...adds one of those funky lines and then says the second thing. \r\n\r\nAs I said, these are just a couple things I have noticed so far. Any ideas of what may be going on, or how to fix it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThx",
