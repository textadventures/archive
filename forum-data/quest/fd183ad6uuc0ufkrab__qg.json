How do you do to organize all your pages? I mean, right now it's no problem but when i have 100 pages I can go crazy to find X page. There has to be some way to organize visualy the pages to make it easy to navigate when you are writing, right?",

Then drag and drop the pages for that group into it. Create as many as you want.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that addresses what you want, but that's the best I can come up with at the moment.\r\n\r\n(Note that this is for the desktop version.
