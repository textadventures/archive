I would assume it does on the one hand and not on the other and I have no way of checking that I am aware of, until my game is officially published.  I just know my game seems to be taking longer and longer to get into the \"editing\" part of it.\r\n\r\nA part of me wants to say it wont be noticeably long, because the person is only playing the game one \"page\" or \"room\" at a time.  While I am editing I have to have the full game up to view all code/scripts/rooms/objects, etc at once.  But then again I assume the player has all that too, but is only seeing it room by room, because the game still needed to be downloaded in full.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know?  I do not play a lot of IF games and the ones I have seemed to of been small in nature, but I have only played a handful.  I do not want players to have to sit there waiting for the game to load and yet I know my game(s) will be rather large in size.  Thank you.",
