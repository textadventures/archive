      "EditableText": "In the older versions of Quest (before 5.0) you could give an object a property called \"weight\" and then assign a value to \"weight\"\r\nThen for the Look command you could just type (for example) A bag of sugar weighing, #sugar:weight\" grams. Then when playing the game and type in Look at Sugar and it would display - \"A bag of sugar weighing, 1000 grams\"\r\nThis could all be done easily with out going into code view.\r\nIs there a way to do it in the newer version of Quest without having an expertise in coding because my knowledge of coding is slim to none?\r\nThank you",
