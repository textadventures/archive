I would like it to go some thing like this:\n\nYou enter room where there is a monster.\nYou get the message: You hear growling.\nYou have 3s/1turn to get out of the room before being attacked.\n\nAlso, the monster is roaming, so i need the game to check each time you enter a room if the monster is there. I have tried everything i can think of. If possible please explain in the GUI editor, I'm bad at coding.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",
