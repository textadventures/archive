However, I have some initial start-up text that I would like the game to pause on while waiting for a mouse click.  There is a built in feature for waiting on a keystroke.  I was wondering if there is a way to do the same only waiting for a mouse, either built in or via javascript.  Thanks in advance.\n\nCheers!",
