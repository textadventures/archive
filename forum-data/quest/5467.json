      "EditableText": "I should know the answer to this, but I've been gone a little while and am likely rusty... and dumber.\n\nI have 'clay' that I want to use on a 'plate'.  If I use the 'use this object on another object' in the clay object's tab, everything works perfectly.\n\nMy problem is this:  the player really should 'put clay in plate' or 'put clay on plate' or 'put clay in square' not just 'use clay on plate', but I can't get Quest to recognize it as the same thing.  I assume I would use a command to create the same outcome, but when I 'put clay in plate' the standard 'Done.' response pops up.  I want both outcomes to be the same.  I've tried placing the command as a child of the plate, clay, player, and game and the results are all the same.  Help please.\n\nDo I need override the built in Quest command for put object in?\n\nThe plate MUST be a container object.  I cannot change that, btw.",

My problem is that I want &quot;use clay on plate&quot; to give equivalent results as &quot;put clay in plate&quot;.  Currently, &quot;use clay on plate&quot; works and &quot;put clay in plate&quot; simply results in a 'Done.' response and the plate is now the parent of the clay.  The best input is actually &quot;put clay in plate&quot; because it makes more sense, but I'd like it to work for either input.",
