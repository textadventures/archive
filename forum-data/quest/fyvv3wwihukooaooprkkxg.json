If they aren't it will cause an error. If they are, it will create a new list named `Kidou` and add that to the end of all the others.\r\n\r\nIf `Black Coffin`, `Crashing Blue Flames`, `Crawling Rope`, and `Arc Shield` are the names of in-game objects, then as KV says your code would need to be:\r\n```\r\nKidou = NewObjectList()\r\nlist add (Kidou, Black Coffin)\r\nlist add (Kidou, Crashing Blue Flames)\r\nlist add (Kidou, Crawling Rope)\r\nlist add (Kidou, Arc Shield)\r\n```\r\nif they are just menu options, it would need to be:\r\n```\r\nKidou = NewStringList()\r\nlist add (Kidou, \"Black Coffin\")\r\nlist add (Kidou, \"Crashing Blue Flames\")\r\nlist add (Kidou, \"Crawling Rope\")\r\nlist add (Kidou, \"Arc Shield\")\r\n```\r\nwhich is an unusual thing to do because it's exactly the same as:\r\n```\r\nKidou = Split (\"Black Coffin;Crashing Blue Flames;Crawling Rope;Arc Shield\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn which case the full code to display the menu would be:\r\n```\r\nif (not HasAttribute (game, \"kidou\")) {\r\n  game.kidou = Split (\"Black Coffin;Crashing Blue Flames;Crawling Rope;Arc Shield\")\r\n}\r\nelse if (ListCount (game.kidou) = 0) {\r\n  list add (game.kidou, \"Ultimate Final Option\")\r\n}\r\nShowMenu (\"Pick an option!\", game.kidou, true) {\r\n  list remove (game.kidou, result)\r\n  switch (result) {\r\n    case (\"Black Coffin\") {\r\n      // insert code here\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"Crashing Blue Flames\") {\r\n      // insert code here\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"Crawling Rope\") {\r\n      // insert code here\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"Arc Shield\") {\r\n      // insert code here\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"Ultimate Final Option\") {\r\n      // insert code here\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",
