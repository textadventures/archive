Or, maybe it is like, &quot;you raise a flag&quot;, the &quot;flag of walking is now raised and the flag of flying is now lowered&quot; and the reverse of the &quot;flag of flying is now raised and the flag of walking is now lowered&quot;.<br/><br/>A &quot;flag&quot; represents the action that booleans attributes of true/false (and their switching~changing between true or false) do or are used to do, and so coders use the term of &quot;flag&quot;, and~or a &quot;flag&quot; is recognizable by non-coders, whereas a non-coder is like, &quot;WTF?!, is a boolean?&quot;, lol.<br/><br/>that is probably confusing, so let me use an example, lol:<br/><br/>the &quot;player&quot; has a boolean attribute called &quot;flying&quot; and it's value is set initially to false.<br/><br/>there's a key that is far above the &quot;player's&quot; reach that he must get. (the key has it's own script not letting it be taken unless the player's &quot;flying&quot; attribute is &quot;true&quot; = if flying, then take key; if not flying, than msg &quot;What?!, Did you think you could fly?!&quot;)<br/><br/>while his &quot;flying&quot; is false, the &quot;player&quot; can't get the needed key.<br/><br/>however, the player has a flying potion in his~her inventory, and upon drinking it, it &quot;Sets the flying flag&quot; to &quot;On&quot; (true) or now has &quot;flagged flying&quot;, and now the player can get the needed key.<br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/>yes, doors and exits are not noobie friendly, lol. there's been some complaints about exits (mainly exits) and thus their often corresponding need of a &quot;door&quot; object, to unlock the exit. people want the exit to act like a &quot;door&quot; itself, instead of having to create an additional object, a &quot;door&quot; object to go along with the exit.<br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>in this case, you should ignore the GUI~Editor, and work with the code. As the GUI-Editor limits or confuses you, as it's the code lines that matter, and the GUI-Editor 's choices (container vs openable~closeable) thus limits you in what code lines are available for you to use at the same time.<br/><br/>you can have any code you want, even creating a &quot;chimera&quot; object that can do ALL (or any combination) of these things:<br/><br/>openable~closeable = a &quot;door&quot;<br/>lockable~unlockable = a &quot;door or chest or whatever&quot;<br/>container (open, closed, and~or surface) = a &quot;container or something's top, like a table's top or a counter's top or a desk's top&quot;<br/>switchable (turn on/off) = &quot;electronics or spell or whatever)<br/>etc etc etc (see the different tab's options of~for objects)<br/><br/>if you want to map out what the GUI~Editor's options match to what code lines, please do so for us!, lol <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --><br/><br/>for example:<br/><br/>choose some object to be a SURFACE container, and then check the code, to see what code lines are used (ADDED) for it.<br/>do the same for OPENABLE~CLOSEABLE, SWITCHABLE, and etc etc etc<br/><br/>you can trick the GUI~Editor, choose the object to be a container, so you're given the lockable~unlockable options, select it to be lockable (so that, that option remains there), and then switch the object to be OPENABLE~CLOSEABLE instead of a OPEN~CLOSE container, and you'll retain the LOCKABLE~UNLOCKABLE options, as otherwise, if you just set the object to be OPENABLE~CLOSEABLE, you won't have the options of LOCKABLE~UNLOCKABLE.<br/><br/>so, thus, just work with the code, as the GUI~Editor is messy at best, or limiting at worst, lol.<br/><br/>--------------<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>you can see Alex' quest engine's core's coding in the GUI~Editor by simply clicking on the filter in the lower left corner, and choosing to show all the stuff (or whatever it is called), it'll be shown as a light grey, in the left pane's &quot;tree of stuff&quot;, you can see all the pre-set verbs, and etc, and see how Alex has them set up to work, though for you and me (for noobs or at least me anyways) the coding is a bit too complex for us to try to create on our own, lol. Though, it is very educational to look at, hehe.<br/><br/>This is where~how Jaynebonne has provided the &quot;open&quot; scripts in his~her above post (or he~she just looked at the core code provided online of quest, lol), for instance.",
