I want the player to use an item in a room that makes the people get scared and run out.\r\nSo, I started by giving the crowds a property of [b:2kqibell]scared[/b:2kqibell], thinking that if an item with a property of [b:2kqibell]weapon [/b:2kqibell]were used in the room whether on them directly or just used in general in the same room, they would panic and I would move the crowd objects out.\r\n\r\nMaybe this will be similar to the drop all/take all scenario as far as running a script on every object in the room but should it also run a script on the item you are holding?

So when the command to use an object is entered we take flight. First checking, does this object have the weapon property? If not do what normally happens when using an object, if it DOES let's see if there are npc's around and if they are scared move 'em. \r\n\r\nSo we go through each object in the current room and see if they have a property NPC, if they don't Quest just forgets them, if they do Quest is going to hold onto them for a second(it calls them #quest.thing# automatically) and check them for another property SCARED, if they have this property then they get moved to NEW-ROOM otherwise they stay put.\r\n\r\nPretty simple huh? Now you could have gotten the same effect with less code by not checking if you gave those NPC objects a property called NPC and instead just checking each object in the room for the SCARED property and moving them accordingly. However if you accidentally gave a chair a SCARED property it would hightail it out of there, and this way if somebody in the room is rough and tough and not scared they will stay there. \r\n\r\nBasically I just threw in the extra step because I have coding OCD and like to keep everything exact.\r\n\r\nEdit: To make everything just as you said, the property to check for wou\r\n\r\nHope that helps.",
