      "EditableText": "Any object (including rooms) has both a name and an alias. If defined, the alias is shown to the player. Otherwise, the name is. The name must be unique internally, but the alias does not. So in your case, set the alias for the three rooms to &quot;road through village&quot;, so that's what the player will see, and then make the internal names whatever you like. I tend to lean away from having objects without aliases. I don't want to have the player exposed to what my internal names might be.",
