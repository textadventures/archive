So I opened a couple up with wordpad, and changed the code to say made with 353, just to see what would happen, and they worked better, but then objects wouldn't show up, and other things wouldn't function. For most of the games in the archive, it's not such a shame to not be able to play them, but if someone would come out with a good game, (which there  [u:1wckul4o]are[/u:1wckul4o] a few of, actually) it would be a waste of time spent making a game to not be able to use it with newer versions. That's just my opinion.               --",
