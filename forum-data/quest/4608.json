I want certain containers (not all of them) to not be able to have items placed in them.\n\nFor example, I have a pedestal that you can open to reveal a book.  However, you can place your sword in there which obviously, a sword wouldn't fit inside a pedestal, nor would most of the items the character carries.  So, I want to prevent the player from putting any items inside the pedestal.\n\nI'm very new and I know next to nothing about coding.

      "EditableText": "The problem is that &quot;put X in/on Y&quot; is a command, not a verb. So it's not handled via the verb mechanism.\n\nThe solution gets back to the code I had posted before but removed. A container can have an &quot;addscript&quot; attribute, which is a script called when an object is added to the container (put in/on). Unfortunately, it's not a script - it's something called a &quot;delegate&quot;, which is sort of like a script with extra information added that makes it almost like a function. Probably more than you need to know, but the downside of delegates is that you can't edit them in the GUI. The delegate type for this attribute is &quot;AddScript&quot;.\n\nSo if you had this attribute in your object:\n\n[code:3nzt9buc]    &lt;addscript type=&quot;AddScript&quot;&gt;\n      msg (&quot;You can't put things here&#46;&quot;)\n    &lt;/addscript&gt;[/code:3nzt9buc]\nthen it would print out that message instead of adding to the container. If instead, you had:\n\n[code:3nzt9buc]    &lt;addscript type=&quot;AddScript&quot;&gt;\n      msg (&quot;The object is vaporized! Bwa ha ha ha!&quot;)\n      object&#46;parent  = null\n    &lt;/addscript&gt;[/code:3nzt9buc]\nthen the object would disappear along with a sinister message.\n\nBut you'd have to edit this all in code view, which might be a bit much. If you can let me know the behaviors, I could create a library with some types with the right delegate implementations that you could derive your special containers from. Inheritance you can do easily in the GUI. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
