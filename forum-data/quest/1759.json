      "EditableText": "Hello! I purchased QDK Pro last night and am quickly trying to learn how the scripts work. It's a blast so far! My ten year old brother is attempting to convert the paper RPGs he has created into text adventures, and so I'm busily trying to keep ahead of the little fellow.\r\n\r\nI'm currently experimenting with a television and a dvd player as interacting objects. My goal: when the dvd player is turned on, a &quot;dvd collection&quot; menu is called. The user selects a dvd from that menu and it plays on the television. \r\n\r\nWhat I have so far:\r\n\r\n- &quot;turn on dvd player&quot; checks if the tv is on. If yes, then the dvd collection menu is called. \r\n\r\n- dvd is selected from the menu. That sets a flag, for example: &quot;dvd doctor who on&quot;\r\n\r\nQuestion!\r\nHow do I get the television to discern between several different flags? A gazillion if-then queries? ie. if flag 1 on, then look=this, if flag 2 on, then look=that? I can't make that work thus far. I had the stray thought that I could have the menu call a case selection in order to minimize all of the flags... but I'm still lost on how I could change the look property depending upon which dvd flag/case is active.\r\n\r\nIdeas? Thanks!\r\n- Lorien",
