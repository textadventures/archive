For example, if the player tries to take an object that isn't there, the default message is something like \"I can't see that here.\"\n\nThere are more advanced messages as well.  If a player tries to give an object to an incorrect object, the default message is something like \"#quest.error.pronoun# doesn't want #quest.error.article#\"\nAnd therein, lies my question.  I want a default command for dropping an object that can't be dropped.  I tried every version of this I could think of and I get nowhere.  The main idea is if a player tries to drop an object, \"You might be able to use #quest.object# somewhere else.\"  I've also substituted #@object# and #quest.error.name# and several others.\nEach time, when I try to drop an undroppable item, I get no response.\n\nPLEASE HELP!!!!",
