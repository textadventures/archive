The problem is, that the player does not see these special exits in the game, not in the &quot;places and objects&quot;-list, not in the compass, nor in the gamewindow. So its a piece of luck, that the player types this look-command. So what would be a good solution for this problem? Show the exits in the compass? Displaying something like \n&quot;...\nYou can go west or south. \nYou can look: west&quot; \nin the gamewindow? Any hints?",
