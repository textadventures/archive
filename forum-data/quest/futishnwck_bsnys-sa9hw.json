      "EditableText": "Well for starters, when you clone something you can assign it directly to a variable. Like:\r\n```\r\nNewMeatClone=CloneObjectAndMove(CoyoteMeat, SomeRoom)\r\n```\r\nAnd then you can interact with it like:\r\n```\r\nMoveObject(NewMeatClone, SomeOtherRoom)\r\nset NewMeatClone.alias=\"Fresh Coyote Meat\"\r\nMakeVisible (NewMeatClone)\r\n```\r\nAlso, why are you getting two meats in the same room? Where is the _original_ meat?\r\n\r\nBut to answer your original question, yes, it would. CoyoteMeat clones as CoyoteMeat1, CoyoteMeat2 etc. If you have an object that ends in numbers originally, like RandomBush13, then cloning it gives RandomBush14.\r\n\r\nYou can press the Debugger button at the top when playtesting your game to get a full list of every object currently in your game, and their attributes!",
