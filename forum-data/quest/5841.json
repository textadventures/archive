I made two slides with some simple movement on it.\n2.  I clicked save as... and saved the slides as a .gif.  You only get the option of saving the slides separately so I did that.\n3.  I tried to insert the PPT created .gif by 'add a picture' and it only showed the picture but no animation.\n\nI can toy around with saving just one .gif PPT slide to use, but is there some fundamental reason why the animation won't play if the .gif was saved using powerpoint.  Regular .gif files that I save from the internet work just fine.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or solution with this?  Thanks!",
