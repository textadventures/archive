In that case, you could use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (Bottle.parent = player){\r\n  // Do stuff.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most common approach (and the best practice), though, would be:\r\n```\r\nif (Bottle.parent = game.pov){\r\n  // Do stuff\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis explains why we should try to use `game.pov` rather than `player` in most cases: http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/quest_code.html#aside-about-player\r\n\r\n---\r\nPS\r\n\r\nI avoid `while` scripts, unless I'm completely sure that everything in the script will work correctly, inside and out.
