I'm new here and I've been following the tutorial for text adventures for tips on what to do, but I've altogether been making a game unique to the one described in the tutorial. I am using the browser version.\r\nI've had two major issues so far, with the most annoying on being when I select the \"if\" script, I am given no \"then\" header underneath it, only the \"add else\" and \"add else if\" options.\r\nAdditionally, I have followed all instructions on creating an in-game map, but when I go to play the game, no map is generated. This is less urgent, but still takes away from my game.\r\nAny help is much appreciated!\r\n",
