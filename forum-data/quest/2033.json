      "EditableText": "What genre do you usually pick for your games in progress? Which styles works best for text adventures? I thought about this for a while and came up with following alternatives:\n\n1. The point and click adventure a la Monkey Island: You look at stuff, put stuff together in order to create new stuff that will move you forward into the game. This gaming style is linear and story driven, which lets you focus on the writing aspect.\n\n2. The D&amp;D-style RPG: This style adds turn based combat into the mix. You can also meet new people, who can join your party in the quest for holy graals and the like. The downside of this style would be the endless amount of status variables needed in order to make such a game.\n\n3. Literotica: The power of the imagination beats a thousand sleazy pictures, so this style works very well for pure text games. The game &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; springs to mind... But to make something that is original and not done a million times before, that would be a challenge! \n\n4. Turnbased board games: If you can do D&amp;D, then I guess you can do strategy as well. I have not played any text based games of this kind though.\n\nAlso, how do you organize the writing process and manage mapping? Do you write a synopsis first and make a visual map of the rooms, or do you write directly from your heart?",

Although I think you'll be hard pressed to find those who admit they &quot;write from the heart&quot;.  Maybe &quot;from the head&quot;.  Intuition is a hard sell these days.  Structure is kind of important, as far as productivity goes.  That said, you can wing just about anything.  \n\nI think there is a difference in what is required for &quot;interactive fiction&quot; as opposed to RPGs.  Interactive fiction has a history - those who are into it expect certain functionality and conventions.  RPGs are so varied and different that, although they too have certain conventions, there is less pressure to conform.  RPG players expect that reality will be rolled up into tidy little sub-systems, whereas IF players often demand a cloning of reality.\n\nBase RPG:  \n\n[list:2b1crx6w]&gt;attack monster\n\nYou hit the monster for 10 HP.

Small blotches dot the cave floor, and there are speckles of red on your armor. [/list:u:2b1crx6w]\n\nThe point is that you've got to cover every base in IF; in an RPG you are free to leave some things un-described or inconsistent.  Gamism mocks verisimilitude, while IF is forever courting it.",
