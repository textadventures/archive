What I am trying to do is, once the player chooses a starter topic, only have the followups for that topic be selectable until the player either leaves or restarts the convo with a \"Lets talk about something else,\" type topic.\r\n\r\nIs that something I can do with convlib?",

Once you use HideTopic() on something it can´t be reversed with ShowTopic().\r\n\r\nI have the same problem but I don´t have an implemented solution. Just a concept:\r\n\r\nMy current idea is that once the player selects a branching topic, the game moves all other topics from the NPC to another room, before moving the appropriate branch-topics to the NPC. On exiting the branch the topics are moved back to the NPC. If other objects that the npc is carrying don´t matter during the conversation, you don´t even need to seperate the topics from the NPCs other children. Just move all of them to a storage room (and back).\r\n\r\nOne constraint is that you can´t place topics in rooms anymore because they wouldn´t be moved by the script. (Topics starting with a characters name and placed in a room are only visible if the NPC is in the room.)\r\n\r\nAre there any more obvious problems with this idea?",
