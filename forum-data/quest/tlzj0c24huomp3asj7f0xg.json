However, it would be great if you could \"just\" fix a few bugs, such as the problems with the map problems which occur when you play \"A Stranger, Unregarded\".\r\n\r\nAre there planned any updates?  (either downloadable interpreter or online play)\r\n\r\nIt is a shame if these games are forgotten and I don't see it as realistic that all these games are converted partly manually to QuestJS which would probably require a whole new round of testing.\r\n\r\nI don't know if Quest 5 has been fully abandoned(?) but 10 years ago or so, we had a similar situation when users went from Adrift 4 to Adrift 5. Not only were they quite different, so the users had to learn the new, but Adrift 5 wasn't fully backwards compatible either, so the Adrift 4 games appeared bugged and a lot of users were disappointed back then. Considering all work was more or less done by one person, it was fully understandable. Just thought I share that story in the hope that you will still make sure the Quest 5 games are playable, preferably even better by fixing the interpreter bugs, ideally both online and the downloadable version.",
