      "EditableText": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a game with music (as a matter of fact something is almost always playing). One challenge that I'm experiencing right now is that when the player loads a saved game they will start out with silence until they enter a part of the game where music will be activated again. The song that should be playing is often indicated by a flag. I am wondering if there is any way to make a certain script run when a saved game is loaded. My idea is that this script will check  for the appropriate flag and play the corresponding song. \r\nDisclaimer: I mostly use the graphical editor (offline version). I have a little experience with programming and know how to access the \"code view\" for the game, but if any explanations can be kept relatively simple I would appreciate it ^_^",
