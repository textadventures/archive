First,  is there anywhere that has any decent tutorials, particularly relating to MUDS? I'm interested in anything to do with writing players stats, skills, magic - the kind of thing you find in a typical MUD. I'm a relative (but not total) novice with regards to programming. Secondly, are there any other good sources of resources (try saying that after a few pints) out there for Quest, in terms of developing? Script libraries and the like?\n\nThanks for your time, and once again - hello!",
