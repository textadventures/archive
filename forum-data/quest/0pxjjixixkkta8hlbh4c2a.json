      "EditableText": "I think what you are probably more able to garner are possible paid advertisements and donantions.  There are hundreds of free text adventure games already out there with many more on the way.  Unless you are doing something extremely unique or fun, I just don't see it selling.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, you have the potential to alienate yourself from the rest of the community.  I mean I guess it would be great to have a handful of people in the grand scheme of things, pay for and play your game.  But you throw away the oppotunity for thousands of people who are not willing to pay and will simply pass your game by for practically an infinite amount of others that are free.\r\n\r\nI say that, but know for a fact other games that were made in garages so to speak, actually sold well.  They were determined, stuck with simplicity and had the fun factor on their side.  But they also were graphical and pretty to look at.  Interactive Fiction and Multi-User Dungeons are a niche and not likely to do as well.\r\n\r\nThen again there are some people who enjoy throwing away their money so maybe you can profit a little from it.  It is not like you had to pay for using Quest or any thing.  Just don't quit your day job with out banking first.\r\n\r\nEither way, good luck to you!  ^_^",

      "HTML": "<p>I think what you are probably more able to garner are possible paid advertisements and donantions.  There are hundreds of free text adventure games already out there with many more on the way.  Unless you are doing something extremely unique or fun, I just don't see it selling.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, you have the potential to alienate yourself from the rest of the community.  I mean I guess it would be great to have a handful of people in the grand scheme of things, pay for and play your game.  But you throw away the oppotunity for thousands of people who are not willing to pay and will simply pass your game by for practically an infinite amount of others that are free.</p>\n<p>I say that, but know for a fact other games that were made in garages so to speak, actually sold well.  They were determined, stuck with simplicity and had the fun factor on their side.  But they also were graphical and pretty to look at.  Interactive Fiction and Multi-User Dungeons are a niche and not likely to do as well.</p>\n<p>Then again there are some people who enjoy throwing away their money so maybe you can profit a little from it.  It is not like you had to pay for using Quest or any thing.  Just don't quit your day job with out banking first.</p>\n<p>Either way, good luck to you!  ^_^</p>\n\n",
