It is beautiful and peaceful, yet eerie and unnerving, as though you are being watched. You feel like this place is familiar to you, although you're sure you have never been here before. Massive trees surround you on all sides, and seem to continue endlessly no matter how far you travel. You are unsure if it is day or night for the thick canopy of leaves that block the sky entirely. True to the forests name, no sound, not the songs of the birds or even the wind can be heard.
