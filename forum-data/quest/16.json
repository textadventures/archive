      "EditableText": "\"if property\" checks whether a property exists, and the format is \"if property &lt;object name; property name&gt;\", not \"if property &lt;object name; property name = value&gt;\". Properties without values are either on or off; properties with values can be anything.\n\nSo, there are two ways of fixing your problem:\n\n1. Use boolean properties, which are either on or off. So, instead of using \"properties &lt;prOpen = false&gt;\", use \"properties &lt;not prOpen&gt;\". Then instead of \"property &lt;Grate; prOpen = true&gt;\", use \"property &lt;Grate; prOpen&gt;\". Instead of \"if property &lt;Grate; prOpen = true&gt;\", use \"if property &lt;Grate; prOpen&gt;\".\n\n2. OR use the correct syntax for checking whether an object's property has a particular value. This isn't done using \"if property\", as that only checks boolean (on/off) properties, and here you're setting properties to [i:mvunrfxi]values[/i:mvunrfxi] of \"true\" or \"false\". A subtle difference, and one that has been misunderstood in the past - so I will probably add value-checking support for \"if property\" to future versions of Quest. Until then, the proper syntax to use is \"if ( #Grate:prOpen# = true) then ...\" (and this is the best syntax to use even if I do implement \"if property &lt;object name; property = value&gt;\", as you can also use checks other than \"=\" with this syntax, such as greater than &gt;, less than &lt; etc.)\n\nHopefully this makes sense, I seem to have waffled a bit.",
