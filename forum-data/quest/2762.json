There also appears to be an option in the dropdown to create a StringList as an object/room attribute, but not an object list. If I create the objectlist using [i:2f5gzq7j]NewObjectList[/i:2f5gzq7j] in a script in the game start script then I can appear to be able to assign it values using [i:2f5gzq7j]new list game.objectlistname[/i:2f5gzq7j] from a function elsewhere in the game (or at least it doesn't throw an error), but if I try and access the list using [i:2f5gzq7j]ObjectListItem(game.objectlistname, dice)[/i:2f5gzq7j] then it throws an error of [b:2f5gzq7j]Function Not Found ObjectListItem(Object, Int32)[/b:2f5gzq7j]. Likewise if I move the list value assignment into the start script. If however I put the objectlist creation and assignment and ObjectListItem all into the same function (which isn't really what I want) then it all works fine.\n\nAm I missing something? Get the same problem on 5.0 and 5.1.\n\nOtherwise great programme.",
