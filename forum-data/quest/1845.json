Im really glad that they put it into the magazine (otherwise I wouldn't have found out about it) but I would like to mention that the version on the disk supplies all the extra files for &quot;typelib&quot; but not the actual .qlb (when I try to run the typelib example the program crashes and says that the &quot;typelib.qlb&quot; file is missing) and that there doesn't seem to be any tutorials that came with it (apart from the help file and arena.asl) . Is this correct or did the software installer not work fully on my computer??? (Im sorry if this is the wrong place to mention it, but it IS related to the magazine I guess)",

Hope you enjoy Quest as well...",

I wrote TYPELIB.QLB (in its various versions) a LONG time ago to address shortcomings in early versions of Quest 2 and subsequently revised it for Quest 3.  It was intended to provide functionality that was missing in those early incarnations of Quest.\n\nWith the advent of Quest 4, TYPELIB as last released is pretty much redundant and I discourage anyone from using it. It must be remembered it was a workaround (by necessity pretty much a kludge in lots of ways) and most of what it did is now built into Quest.  It served its purpose, but it is no longer needed.\n\nBest of luck with your projects!\n\n(Still lurking, but no longer participating)\n\nAl (MaDbRiT)",
