My problem is that the program is almost always freezing on me when I'm doing anything with a lot of ifs or heavy scripting. It will let me go in and load up one part of heavy script but then if I try to change any of it, try to open up a different script or try any cutting or pasting it will completely freeze. \r\nI have gone through the other posts on this and tried the to reinstall quest but still the same problem. I love the program and really want to complete the game I've started but now I can't even change something that I know I've done wrong, I need to add a new if above the current ones to make different responses when the npc changes room but if I try to change the script it freezes and crashes.\r\nAny help would be great as I really want to continue using the program.",
