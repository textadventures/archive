Setting the item.alt for a known clone, like key1, is easy.  I'm having trouble creating an alt for an unknown clone.\n\nI have an attribute of player.stuff that's an integer.  I would like, each time a clone of any object is created, to set the current player.stuff integer as an alt for that clone.\n\n[code:2x4qkmpt]this&#46;listalias = player&#46;stuff + &quot;&#58; &quot; + this&#46;realname\nthis&#46;alt = player&#46;stuff\nCloneObjectAndMove (this, player)\nmsg (this&#46;realname + &quot; added to cart&#46;&quot;)\nthis&#46;listalias = this&#46;realname\nthis&#46;alt = this&#46;realname\nIncreaseObjectCounter (player, &quot;stuff&quot;)[/code:2x4qkmpt]\n\nThis is what I have, as a script on an object type, where realname is an attribute on each object that I want to be the listalias of each item.\n\nHowever, after I 'verb' the item in question, I can't seem to 'look at' either the original object or the clone using either the original name or the alt.  I get this error, &quot;Error running script&#058; Cannot foreach over '7mm Longarm' as it is not a list&quot;.\n\nI THINK what's happening is that it no longer recognizes item.alt as a list... but I don't know how to fix it.\n\nCan you guys help me?\n\nThanks.",
