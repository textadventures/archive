      "EditableText": "Hmm. What are the destinations' aliases?\r\n\r\nIf `D1 01` is also the alias of the destination, you could use the parser to do it for you.\r\n\r\nGive the command a pattern like: `^visit address\\s*(?<object>\\S.*)?$`.\r\nThen add a script attribute named `changecommandscope` to the command:\r\n```\r\nwhile (ListCount (items) > 0) {\r\n  list remove (items, ListItem (items, 0))\r\n}\r\nforeach (dest, game.destinations) {\r\n  list add (items, DictionaryItems (game.destinations, dest))\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis basically uses the parser's object matching system, the same as when the player types the name of an object they can see. It just changes the list of available objects to those that appear in `game.destinations`.\r\n\r\nthen you could change the script to:\r\n```\r\nif (IsDefined(\"object\")) {\r\n  player.parent = object\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  // this part runs if the player doesn't type a destination\r\n  // put the existing script here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the address the player needs to type is not the same as the room's alias, it would be a little tougher. I'd probably do it by making a room full of objects that map onto the rooms. For example, you could make an object with the alias `D1 01` and its `to` attribute pointing to the actual room. Then you could put all these objects in a room that the player can't reach, and change the scope of the command to that room's name. In that case you don't need a `changecommandscope` script (but you do need to make a bunch of extra objects)\r\n\r\nHope I got that right :)",
