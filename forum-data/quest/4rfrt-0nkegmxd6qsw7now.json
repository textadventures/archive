I'm using the online/web version.\r\nFirst of all, I'm having trouble with talking/conversations and showing a menu. It's at the beginning of the game, and I want to use it in case the player has any questions. I've tried doing the show a menu and click an option thing, but that didn't work. Mainly because I copy-pasted the code and only changed the formatting and the dialogue options. Maybe it's a glitch. I tried the ask/tell too, but that didn't work.\r\nI've also had problems with health and combat. The health seems to look fine.\r\nSee here.\r\nplayer.sethealth = 4\r\nBut I can't seem to get the variable to go down. - and + don't work. Maybe it's the version. Anyways, since this is the first try/version, I've just experimented by trying to have the Pokeon attack the player. But that didn't work.\r\n\r\nAny help is fine. Thanks in advance.\r\n",
