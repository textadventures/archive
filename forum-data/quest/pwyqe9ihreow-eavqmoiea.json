My intend was to use Quest for commercial use, and convert my game in android app. I was really excited by this functionality, and I found the method consisting in using quest.js and phonegap. \r\nHowever, apparently quest.js is no longer maintained, and I can't find any \"exe\" to use. So, I don't understand how to use all this files for the conversion. Is it still possible to convert my quest game into html ?\r\n\r\nThank you",
