      "EditableText": "The easiest way is to use a flag and check if that flag is true.  Let's say... you have a button that needs pushed.  Pushing the button allows you to 'use keyboard'.  Add the verb 'push' to the button.  It's on the verb tab for the object.  Add a new script here.  Maybe, print message 'You have pushed the button.'  Add another script here, too.  Set flag (under variables in the pop-up).  Set flag on object button and name it pushed (or anything else you want).  On the keyboard object, click on the use/give tab.  Here, add a new script.  Choose the 'If' script.  Select 'If object has flag pushed' then run the proper script allowing the player to use the keyboard.  In the 'Else' section of these script, run the proper script telling the player that the keyboard cannot be used yet.\n\nIf this doesn't make sense, ask again!  Also, feel free to check out the 'game' &quot;Quest - Tutorials and Templates&quot;.  It's kind of a tutorial for people who use the GUI rather than write code.  Again, ask if you have any questions.",
