Put it in the inventory to start with, but you can make it hidden.\r\n\r\nIf you give the quiver a script attribute called `changedarrows`, it will be run whenever the number of arrows changes. So you could give it a script like:\r\n```\r\nif (this.arrows > 0) {\r\n  this.visible = true\r\n  this.alias = ToStriing (this.arrows) + \" arrows\"\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  this.visible = false\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen for any arrows, you would give them a \"take\" script (to run when the player takes it) that does:\r\n```\r\nquiver.arrows = quiver.arrows + 1\r\nthis.visible = false\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd for shooting a bow, I assume the bow will have a shoot verb; or that there's some command for shooting. You would make it do something like:\r\n```\r\nif (quiver.arrows = 0) {\r\n  msg (\"You don't have any arrows!\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  quiver.arrows = quiver.arrows - 1\r\n  // the rest of the code to shoot something goes here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you follow how that works, checking a numeric attribute to see how many arrows the object represents?\r\nThere are more complex versions that can also handle piles of arrows out there in the world; this one only does the \"3 arrows\" thing in the inventory. But if you can understand it, you can probably work out how to do it.\r\n\r\nPeople have found many different ways to do that kind of thing. Searching the forum for \"stacking system\" will find a few different approaches, but I think the one I just mentioned is probably the simplest.\r\n\r\n(I did have a pretty fancy one that allows the player to type things like \"drop six arrows\" to split up their supply; but in most cases I think that won't be necessary)",
