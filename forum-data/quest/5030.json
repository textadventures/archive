      "EditableText": "Firstly I would set the window object to be invisible. Then in the open curtains script you can set windows to become visible and in the closed curtains script set it to be invisible again. Or you can just change the response for x windows depending on their state to give a different reply. It's quite complex for a newbie and difficult to convey without being able to give you working examples.\n\nInstead of making the curtains a container like I previously suggested, have you tried just creating them as verbs on the curtains object? This will be a trickier way of doing it as you'll have to set an attribute/flag checking what state they're in but this is the way to do it if making the curtains object a container doesn't work.",
