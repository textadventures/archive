I want each player to start the game with different items. How can I add items to a particular player's inventory when they start the (QuestNet) game? Here is my code that is not working:\r\n\r\nplayer startscript {\r\n\tif $name(%userid%)$ = blake then give &lt;Mobile Phone&gt; \r\n}\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nrob",
