I Want the player to be able to Look At the tickets they have and see the total amount they have. So I wanna be able to +add and -decrease tickets based on winning tickets and using them to buy stuff, any advice? I'm fairly new to coding so I have no real idea. (Sheparoo)\"\r\n\r\n// --------------------------\r\n\r\n\"How do I make the code so that the player recieves tickets for playing the arcade game?\r\n\r\n(I plan on making Skee Ball, for example, and no matter what, the player gets tickets depending on performance)\r\n\r\nThere will be 7 skee balls and therefore 7 attempts to score the highest score possible. I want there to be two verbs, one to throw the ball straight (random chance of 50,40,30,20, or 10 points) and another to throw the ball diagnally (75%chance10points,25%100points).\r\n\r\nSO, I'd like there to be 5 different ranges of tickets you can get. For instance:\r\n~ 70-100pts = Exquisitely Lame - 5 tickets\r\n~110-190pts = Bad - 10 tickets\r\n~200-340pts = Good - 25 tickets\r\n~350-540pts = Awesome - 50 tickets\r\n~550+ pts = Unbelievable - 150 tickets\r\n\r\nHow would I code those outcomes (just one for an example)?\r\n\r\nAnd how can I hide the tickets until the player wins/finds their first tickets?

I Want the player to be able to Look At the tickets they have and see the total amount they have. So I wanna be able to +add and -decrease tickets based on winning tickets and using them to buy stuff, any advice? I'm fairly new to coding so I have no real idea. (Sheparoo)\"\n\n// --------------------------\n\n\"How do I make the code so that the player recieves tickets for playing the arcade game?\n\n(I plan on making Skee Ball, for example, and no matter what, the player gets tickets depending on performance)\n\nThere will be 7 skee balls and therefore 7 attempts to score the highest score possible. I want there to be two verbs, one to throw the ball straight (random chance of 50,40,30,20, or 10 points) and another to throw the ball diagnally (75%chance10points,25%100points).\n\nSO, I'd like there to be 5 different ranges of tickets you can get. For instance:\n~ 70-100pts = Exquisitely Lame - 5 tickets\n~110-190pts = Bad - 10 tickets\n~200-340pts = Good - 25 tickets\n~350-540pts = Awesome - 50 tickets\n~550+ pts = Unbelievable - 150 tickets\n\nHow would I code those outcomes (just one for an example)?\n\nAnd how can I hide the tickets until the player wins/finds their first tickets?
