I want to ask the player to name their character. I need to prompt the character and then have them provide a string. Then I need to access the string to display or copy it to 'player.name'.\n\nI can't find the function that asks the character to input a string. &quot;Ask&quot; seems to only ask Yes/No questions.\n\nThanks for any help,\n\nJohn\nCalifornia, USA\nDabbled in Quest 4 and now Quest 5",
