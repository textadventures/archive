To help, here is a simple example to show what I want to do.\r\n\r\nThere is a simple game with 3 rooms: room 1, room 2, and room 3. The player starts in room 1. If the player enters into room 2, they get attacked by a bear, and lose 50% of their health (in my game, losing health is caused by entering the room, and not by the object.) If a player enters room 3, they get attacked by a Lion, and lose 50% of their health. In this example, I would want “You have been killed by a bear: game over” when the player is killed by the bear, and “You have been killed by a lion: game over” when the player is killed by the lion. Obviously, my game has a lot more, and a lot more ways to die. However, just tell me what to do for my example, and I will figure it out for my actual game.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I am making a text adventure.",

Meaning you can also extend this via if's and elses.",
