The error comes about because when you cancel, &quot;result&quot; is null. So the switch fails. You can handle that by putting:\n\n[code:xu5i2liv]if (result &lt;&gt; null) {\n&#46;&#46;&#46;\n}[/code:xu5i2liv]\naround your switch statement.\n\nFor the first part, you can't control where the popup comes up. (It's a bit tricky to try to determine where exactly pictures and text are anyway, short of not putting it over the window at all, which is highly non-standard.)\n\nOne option (if it suits you) is to change &quot;show menu&quot; to &quot;ShowMenu&quot;. This will use the inline menu code instead of the popup, which might be more to your liking... or not. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
