It doesn't run the script at all, to look into this, run Arena.asl in QuestNet server.  \n\nI can't be certain for all versions, but this is true for pro.\n\nI'd also like to suggest an option to have QuestNet's automatic saves be named something containing the current time at the moment of save. This would allow multiple save files to exist, allowing the restoring of a game from whatever time the user chooses and would also aid in finding a bit more information on QuestNet's uptime problem.",
