I’ve come to realise that it’s a little bit limited when it comes to the player rephrasing commands (i.e typing ‘in’ instead of ‘go into the house’ so I tried out the help button, which is good as it gives the player a bit more handling on the controls. This too, though, is limited, so I was wondering if it was possible to maybe change it slightly, or to take it even a step further, make it change depending on the situation you are currently in in the game.",
