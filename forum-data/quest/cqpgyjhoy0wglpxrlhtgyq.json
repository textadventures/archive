Meaning, I want to be able to have an object be selected with a verb, but only have it appear AFTER something has happened. I have figured out how to add verbs to objects through events by using code. But the verb doesn't have any effect. It simply appears in the object display verb area after the certain event has happened.\r\n\r\nIs there a way for me to create verbs for objects AFTER an event has happened and how do I give that verb meaning?",
