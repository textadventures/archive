I have a few questions about this website, I apologize if the question might sound dumb.\r\n1. Can I program in C++ or should I use HTML?\r\n2. What is Gamebook? \r\n3. I notice we can play music/audio but can we also change the background colour/image and edit text style?\r\n4. Do you guys recommend using web ver or window version? ",

Read a section, if you want to do this - turn to page 47, or if you want to do this instead - turn to page 118.  Gamebook is less flexible, easier to use, but is largely limited in options.  Text adventures are like your classic computer games - n, s, e, w, eat apple, pull lever type commands.  TAs give the illusion that the world is open to explore however the user wishes and they can do whatever they want.

Depending on what you want to do, it can be pretty simple or complex.\r\n\r\n4.  100% use the downloadable desktop version.  If you can avoid the online/web version, do it.  Web version is limited and has quite a few bugs.",
