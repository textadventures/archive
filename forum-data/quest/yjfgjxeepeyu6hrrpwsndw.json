Unfortunately the code works only if you upload your pictures to the internet. I was wondering if there is any way to link the pictures directly from your computer?\r\n\r\nWhile at it, I was also wondering if there is a way to have the picture on top, while keeping the alternative pane order, so that first I can see the picture, followed by status, followed by compass and then inventory.\r\n\r\nAny help would be warmly appreciated!",
