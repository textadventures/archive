If you try one room with several exits off the road, you need to customize your exits - grocery, home, arcade, etc.  if you do one road room with custom exits, you can have an 'exit' command exit and move that player back to the one road room.

The street would be a single Object / room with all other elements orbiting it.\n\nAt other hand, if you plan a character advancing through the street and having places to hide, shots to duck and enemies to defeat, each piece of the street will be a different stage towards the objective. \n\nWhen writing interactive fiction, perhaps attempts only mimicking actual places is not the best, but you should find the meaning or purpose of this place in your narrative.",

Sometimes it may make more sense to just send them directly to where they need to be for the story to progress.",

Going  back is fixed by an exit to nowhere displaying a message about the futility of retracing your steps ( impending night) this means the same general scenery objects are always there, but can be added to as discovered using repeating first time messages. A crude way of doing things but it works for me.",
