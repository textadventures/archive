Play WOW a bit at the moment.\r\n\r\nOn the scripted descriptions, I'll be doing that in my game as well. Make a system where the weather will affect stuff. Like in a town, if it's day and windy and raining it could say 'looking up you see huge rain clouds, which are soaking all around you. a breeze is blowing, making the sign outside the pub swing, it's creaking slightly adding to the noise of the wind and rain.' which'd be so neat. iIll work on a system for doing this soon and if you like I'll share it with you. Got some good ideas already on how to do it.",

I don't know if I should thank you or despise you for that thought, Elex... it was so much easier just planning on every day to be without wind, rain, or a noticeable temperature; just still.  Well, it's going to be hard to leave that thought behind, so more code indeed!",

I'm planning to release my core codes for HavenHold as a huge library/engine when it's done, but I think as long as you put in your game that you stole all your ideas from me then it should be ok. I like your idea Witchy, as it gives me credit while still being in-game. If you want to work together on some ideas for a weather system, that'd bo good. As I last time I built one it would soon go weird and stay at one end of the spectrum, trick I think is to hvae no feedback (variable A changes B which changes C which then changes A, changes B..... and so on until the weather is stuck). Also things like area setting would be good, saying the average weather there, and what special types of weather it can have eg: pritty unlikely to get snow in a desert.",
