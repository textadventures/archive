Could I program a calendar into Online Quest, where the days pass except when you're on a planet, or is that an impossibility? I wish I could have my characters travel for a certain number of days before they could arrive at their next stop. It would take less than a year for the journey to end, and I plan for the journey to start in April, so...\r\n2. Could I program a ship to travel with my characters? Edit, yes, I can, I just need to figure out how to program \"If object is in room logic.\r\n3. Could I program diseases, where the character would get sick and lose health faster?\r\n4. If I can program a ship, could I program it to break and need spare parts?\r\n5. I can't find anything on hunting and ammo. How would I do that?\r\n6. If I can figure out how to have a calendar, I'd like my character to be held up by events. Is there a way I could do that?\r\n7: How would I program food to be worth more to every character's health if there are less characters?\r\n8:  Medicine to remove the disease condition.\r\n9: Theft or fire destroying items?\r\nHelp with any of these items would be greatly appreciated. (I may even put thanks to you in the end sequence.)\r\nEdit: I decided for my ease, I'm going to design the game with one character, and add others later.
