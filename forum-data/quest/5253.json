Good Luck! You'll need it...&quot;\n\nObject Attributes:\n\nthe Value must *NOT* have double quotes, it can't be the special~reserved (a Boolean Attribute's Values) 'true' nor 'false', and it must be an actual-existing Object in the game!\n\n[code:31d6hclb]player&#46;parent = room\nplayer&#46;left_hand = shield\nplayer&#46;right_hand = sword\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;shield&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;sword&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;[/code:31d6hclb]\n\nBoolean Attributes: literally as 'true' or 'false'\n\nNO double quotes!\n\n// the orc starts out alive (duh, lol):\norc.dead = false\n\n// you kill the orc:\norc.dead = true\n\nexample of a built-in Boolean Attribute:\ntv.switchedon=false // or (too lazy to look it up): tv.SwitchedOn=false\ntv.switchedon=true // or (too lazy to look it up): tv.SwitchedOn=true\n\nInteger Attributes: any non-decimal number\n\nplayer.strength_integer = 100\ngame.event_flag_state = 0\nplayer.strength_integer = player.strength_integer + 3\n\nDouble (Float~Floating Point) Attribute: any decimal number\n\nplayer.damage_double = 45.2 // or: &quot;45.2&quot;, as I've never used Doubles, so I don't know if it needs the double quotes or not.\n\nList (Stringlists and Objectlists) Attributes: these are a bit more advanced, so not getting into them\n\nDictionary (Stringdictionaries, Objectdictionaries, and Scriptdictionaries) Attributes: these are even more advanced, so not getting into them\n\netc Attribute Types: too tired to get into them\n\n-----------------\n\nanyways, finally about your question, conceptually about Attribute usage:\n\nyou're used to using and thinking in terms of Object (physical thing) usage, but these are very unweildy, such as:\n\nimagine having actual individual 'silver and gold coins' Objects for your currency~transactions, the sheer quantity of them + having to move them around .. YUCK !!!!\n\nINSTEAD, you want to use Attributes!\n\nYour Objects have Attributes, which you can simply adjust, no moving of actual physical things around, nor in having those physical things. Attributes are awesome! see below, using the currency~transactions example (in code):\n\nwe're only moving the 'sword' Object around, no 'gold coins' and 'silver coins' extra Objects being moved around\n\nshop_owner.cash = 500\nplayer.cash = 100\nsword.price = 50\n\nBuying:\n\nsword.parent = shop_owner\n\nplayer.cash = player.cash - sword.price\nshop_owner.cash = shop_owner.cash + sword.price\nsword.parent = player\n\nSelling:\n\nsword.parent = player\n\nplayer.cash = player.cash + (sword.price / 2)\nshop_owner.cash = shop_owner.cash - (sword.price / 2)\nsword.parent = shop_owner\n\n*note: this should require 'if' scripting to check if you have enough 'cash' to buy the sword and the shop owner to buy the sword, of course, which I've left out, obviously.\n\n----------\n\nfinally for your question specifically:\n\nI would have your 'security' be an Integer Attribute on your 'player' Player Object, by creating~setting it to zero in the GUI~Editor:\n\n'player' Player Object -&gt; 'Attributes' Tab -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (see below)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: security\nAttribute Type: int (integer)\nAttribute Value: 0\n\nin code as scripting: player.security = 0\n\nin code as creation tag:\n\n[code:31d6hclb]&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n  // blah code lines\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;security&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;\n  // blah code lines\n&lt;/object&gt;[/code:31d6hclb]\n\nanyways, conceptually what we're doing is 'flag stating', which probably makes more sense in the examples below:\n\nplayer.security = 0 ~~~~~ you don't have any security clearance, no pretend security card\nplayer.security = 1+ ~~~~~ you have higher levels of security clearance\n\nlet's say you 'push' Verb on a 'machine button' Object, which in its scripting, gives you: player.security = 1\n\nthan on a 'computer' Object, there's a 'hack' Verb, which if successful (using 'if' scripting), each time but increasing harder, increases your security by 1:\nplayer.security = player.security + 1\n\nand lastly, you got 'teleporter door' that are 'Locked' Objects~Exits that require levels of security clearance, example in pseudo-code:\n\nif (player.security=0) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;You don't ahve clearance.&quot;)\n} else if (player.security=1) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;You get into, are moved to, noobie areas~rooms of the game.&quot;)\n} else if (player.security=2) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;You get into, are moved to, intermediate areas~rooms of the game.&quot;)\n} else if (player.security=3) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;You get into, are moved to, hard areas~rooms of the game.&quot;)\n} else if (player.security=4) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;You get into, are moved to, the last area~room of the game.&quot;)\n}",

Good Luck! You'll need it...&quot;<br/><br/>Object Attributes:<br/><br/>the Value must *NOT* have double quotes, it can't be the special~reserved (a Boolean Attribute's Values) 'true' nor 'false', and it must be an actual-existing Object in the game!<br/><br/><pre><code>player&#46;parent = room<br/>player&#46;left_hand = shield<br/>player&#46;right_hand = sword<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;shield&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;sword&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>Boolean Attributes: literally as 'true' or 'false'<br/><br/>NO double quotes!<br/><br/>// the orc starts out alive (duh, lol):<br/>orc.dead = false<br/><br/>// you kill the orc:<br/>orc.dead = true<br/><br/>example of a built-in Boolean Attribute:<br/>tv.switchedon=false // or (too lazy to look it up): tv.SwitchedOn=false<br/>tv.switchedon=true // or (too lazy to look it up): tv.SwitchedOn=true<br/><br/>Integer Attributes: any non-decimal number<br/><br/>player.strength_integer = 100<br/>game.event_flag_state = 0<br/>player.strength_integer = player.strength_integer + 3<br/><br/>Double (Float~Floating Point) Attribute: any decimal number<br/><br/>player.damage_double = 45.2 // or: &quot;45.2&quot;, as I've never used Doubles, so I don't know if it needs the double quotes or not.<br/><br/>List (Stringlists and Objectlists) Attributes: these are a bit more advanced, so not getting into them<br/><br/>Dictionary (Stringdictionaries, Objectdictionaries, and Scriptdictionaries) Attributes: these are even more advanced, so not getting into them<br/><br/>etc Attribute Types: too tired to get into them<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>anyways, finally about your question, conceptually about Attribute usage:<br/><br/>you're used to using and thinking in terms of Object (physical thing) usage, but these are very unweildy, such as:<br/><br/>imagine having actual individual 'silver and gold coins' Objects for your currency~transactions, the sheer quantity of them + having to move them around .. YUCK !!!!<br/><br/>INSTEAD, you want to use Attributes!<br/><br/>Your Objects have Attributes, which you can simply adjust, no moving of actual physical things around, nor in having those physical things. Attributes are awesome! see below, using the currency~transactions example (in code):<br/><br/>we're only moving the 'sword' Object around, no 'gold coins' and 'silver coins' extra Objects being moved around<br/><br/>shop_owner.cash = 500<br/>player.cash = 100<br/>sword.price = 50<br/><br/>Buying:<br/><br/>sword.parent = shop_owner<br/><br/>player.cash = player.cash - sword.price<br/>shop_owner.cash = shop_owner.cash + sword.price<br/>sword.parent = player<br/><br/>Selling:<br/><br/>sword.parent = player<br/><br/>player.cash = player.cash + (sword.price / 2)<br/>shop_owner.cash = shop_owner.cash - (sword.price / 2)<br/>sword.parent = shop_owner<br/><br/>*note: this should require 'if' scripting to check if you have enough 'cash' to buy the sword and the shop owner to buy the sword, of course, which I've left out, obviously.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>finally for your question specifically:<br/><br/>I would have your 'security' be an Integer Attribute on your 'player' Player Object, by creating~setting it to zero in the GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>'player' Player Object -&gt; 'Attributes' Tab -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: security<br/>Attribute Type: int (integer)<br/>Attribute Value: 0<br/><br/>in code as scripting: player.security = 0<br/><br/>in code as creation tag:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>  // blah code lines<br/>  &lt;attr name=&quot;security&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>  // blah code lines<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>anyways, conceptually what we're doing is 'flag stating', which probably makes more sense in the examples below:<br/><br/>player.security = 0 ~~~~~ you don't have any security clearance, no pretend security card<br/>player.security = 1+ ~~~~~ you have higher levels of security clearance<br/><br/>let's say you 'push' Verb on a 'machine button' Object, which in its scripting, gives you: player.security = 1<br/><br/>than on a 'computer' Object, there's a 'hack' Verb, which if successful (using 'if' scripting), each time but increasing harder, increases your security by 1:<br/>player.security = player.security + 1<br/><br/>and lastly, you got 'teleporter door' that are 'Locked' Objects~Exits that require levels of security clearance, example in pseudo-code:<br/><br/>if (player.security=0) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;You don't ahve clearance.&quot;)<br/>} else if (player.security=1) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;You get into, are moved to, noobie areas~rooms of the game.&quot;)<br/>} else if (player.security=2) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;You get into, are moved to, intermediate areas~rooms of the game.&quot;)<br/>} else if (player.security=3) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;You get into, are moved to, hard areas~rooms of the game.&quot;)<br/>} else if (player.security=4) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;You get into, are moved to, the last area~room of the game.&quot;)<br/>",

      "EditableText": "yeah well I spent a long time making loads and loads of edits to the civ 4 xml files, I think I really improved the game tbh, at first I just focused on the WW2 era and made loads of new units, I made a limit for every unit so you can have 200 max infantry, 10 max medium tanks, 6 max heavy tanks, 20 max light tanks, 50 max machine guns etc etc, everything was limited except eventually when you've built everything you have the option for weaker reserve infantry or some weak frigate ships.  Then I made most units more realistic or good at countering others, made some more fun invisible units like snipers..  I gave all the units the historical names they had so the American light tank was a stuart 37mm, the german machine gun was mg42 etc, and I gave them stats I thought were kind of realistic to their actual strengths.. like the Japanese tanks were just awful.  I made 3 new civics Communism, Capitalism and Nazism and made each side favour the relevant one so Germany would always choose Nazism, Russia communism etc, and I made them love the sides which chose the same and hate the sides which chose a different one, so the alliances were always historically accurate.  And I put them in the right place on the world map.   After a while I think it got quite good, but then my laptop broke so all the changes were lost lol.  I would have put accurate graphics and sounds too onto it eventually if I could and maybe even turned it into a mod to share if other people would have liked it.  But yeah, meh, oh well.",

      "HTML": "yeah well I spent a long time making loads and loads of edits to the civ 4 xml files, I think I really improved the game tbh, at first I just focused on the WW2 era and made loads of new units, I made a limit for every unit so you can have 200 max infantry, 10 max medium tanks, 6 max heavy tanks, 20 max light tanks, 50 max machine guns etc etc, everything was limited except eventually when you've built everything you have the option for weaker reserve infantry or some weak frigate ships.
