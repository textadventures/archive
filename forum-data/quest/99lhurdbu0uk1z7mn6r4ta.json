Sometimes find it laggy so I started hunting the forums to see if that would happen when I downloaded my game... Then I figured I'd just try downloading it and see what happens as I ultimately want to try and sell a game via my website. \r\n\r\nI only get 1 file when I download which doesn't execute or do anything on my mac. Just one solitary file which led me to do more hunting. \r\n\r\nAm I going wrong soemwhere or does the Web Editor not output a game that I can take as a package and sell via my website eventually?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help. Jsut want to avoid building a complete game if it can't be taken offline and ultimately sold somewhere and or even played offline by others I choose to give it to wihtout it being hosted on this site forever. \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers ",
