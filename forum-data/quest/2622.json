I've always wanted to find a text adventure program I could use since I can't program for toffee, and this one is just fantastic. Now, my questions.\n\n1) Is there a way I can use the conditional case script function with flags? In the tutorial it bases it on a player entering a telephone number. I currently have my npcs acting different and offering different speech menus depending on how far the player is through certain quests (for which I set and unset flags appropriately). This works well, but it does mean that I have to embed if function after if function. As I add more quests (and thus more flags) this gets increasingly convoluted and time-consuming.\n\nI have tried simply having more than one if script without embedding, but this tends to cause those scripts to overlap and I find that it means I cannot have a &quot;default&quot; response if no flags are set (ie, if the character is not involved in any active quests), as that default response then gets said by the character [i:13aqmo51]as well[/i:13aqmo51] as any flag-appropriate speech.\n\nAny ideas would be appreciated, because the length of some of these if functions (and the numbers of windows I need to click through to get to the most recent) will start to drive me mad!\n\n2) The story I am working on is [i:13aqmo51]very[/i:13aqmo51] explicit. Would it still be suitable for upload to textadventures.co.uk when I'm done, or would it be best off kept privately? I see there is an adult section already on the website with some very explicit work displayed, but I simply want to make sure. Just to make it clear, when I say explicit I mean in terms of the language used and the graphic nature of the game - I don't mean I'm descibing anything illegal. All the, um, adult material in the game is consensual and legal between partners!\n\nThanks for the help.",

If it's still 0 at the end, you know the response hasn't been handled yet, so you can print a default.\n\nAdult content is OK on textadventures.co.uk but obviously nothing illegal is allowed. I have the final say so I reserve the right to delete a game, but I am generally pretty lenient.
