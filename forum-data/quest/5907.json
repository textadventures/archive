The subsequent statements fail because they depend on the GET INPUT information.  At least that's what I think I'm seeing happen.\nHow can I use GET INPUT successfully, and then immediately run another command that use the supplied (and processed/manipulated) input and then return to the script?\n\nEven without GET INPUT, I'd also like to know how to have a script run one or more custom commands (with parameters), do them in series and return to the script when completed.\n\nI guess an event driven environment might make this impossible without having some jscript or additional engine capability, but I'm not sure.",
