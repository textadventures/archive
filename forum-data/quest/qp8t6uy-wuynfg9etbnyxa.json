It doesn't have to strictly be 'Player' like in my example. If you have the player controlling an object named 'Hero' then it'd be 'Hero.Willpower'.\r\n\r\nOn a second readthrough, I think I more thoroughly understand what you want. For a little display on the side to read 'Willpower 100/100' and such, where Health and Score would be, right? For that, using my example, you'd need a 3rd attribute (2 if you don't want MaxWillpower), one to actually DISPLAY the result.\r\n\r\nSo it'd look like - without MaxWillpower - that you give your object, say, Hero, the status Willpower as a blank string that the player actually sees, and the attribute WillpowerNumber as a double equal to 100.\r\n\r\nThen you'd have code write, again in psuedocode:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHero.Willpower=\"Willpower \"+Hero.WillpowerNumber+\"/100\"\r\n```\r\nOr however it is you want to format it.\r\n\r\nThen, say, somewhere a rock falls on the hero's head and reduces their willpower.\r\n```\r\nHero.WillpowerNumber=Hero.WillpowerNumber-20\r\n```\r\nBut wait, is Hero.Willpower still showing it as 100/100 and not 80/100? Update Hero.Willpower to properly reflect the new WillpowerNumber with\r\n```\r\nHero.Willpower=\"Willpower \"+Hero.WillpowerNumber+\"/100\"\r\n```\r\nThat's where changeScripts are VERY useful. Rather than need to include the Willpower Display Update Code every single time anything might possibly change Willpower, you just go to Hero, click the WillpowerNumber attribute, and use the button (Alongside Add Attribute, Remove Attribute etc) to make a Changescript for Hero.WillpowerNumber, and put the code there.\r\n\r\nThat way, ANY time ANYTHING changes Hero's WillpowerNumber, it'll automatically update your Hero.Willpower display!",

displayment of): 'Life: 999/999'\r\n\r\n// unfortunately, the status attributes, don't automatically update for us, so we got to cause it to update for us, which the easiest and usually best way is via the special 'changedNAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE' Script Attributes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nplayer.changedcurrent_life => {\r\n\r\n  // handling/correcting if/should your current life be/get raised above the maximum life or below the minimum life (if you want this type of game mechanic, of keeping a stat in a min-max range/bounds, so games don't do this game mechanic however, it's up to you):\r\n\r\n  if (player.current_life > player.maximum_life) {\r\n    player.current_life = player.maximum_life\r\n  } else if (player.current_life < player.minimum_life) {\r\n    player.current_life = player.minimum_life\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // this code line below, is the adjustment to the 'player.life' String Attribute, as this is what the status attribute needs to use for its displayment, and since

+ player.current_life + \"/\" + player.maximum_life\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nyou also need to handle when/if you 'maximum_life' gets changed as well (such as when leveling up, your maximum life increases):\r\n\r\n```\r\nplayer.changedmaximum_life => {\r\n\r\n  // handling/correcting if/should your current life becomes higher than the maximum life, if/should/if-can your maximum life be lowered below your current life (if you want this type of game mechanic, of keeping a stat in a min-max range/bounds, so games don't do this game mechanic however, it's up to you):\r\n\r\n  if (player.current_life > player.maximum_life) {\r\n    player.current_life = player.maximum_life\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // this code line below, is the adjustment to the 'player.life' String Attribute, as this is what the status attribute needs to use for its displayment, and since this is within the special 'changed' Script Attribute, it causes your status attributes to update, displaying the new/correct displayment of your 'life' stat:\r\n\r\n  player.life = \"Player Life: \" + player.current_life + \"/\" + player.maximum_life\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nusually, a minimum value of a range, isn't adjustable, but if you want this game mechanic, than you got to handle it as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\nplayer.changedminimum_life => {\r\n\r\n  // handling/correcting if/should your current life becomes higher than the maximum life, if/should/if-can your maximum life be lowered below your current life (if you want this type of game mechanic, of keeping a stat in a min-max range/bounds, so games don't do this game mechanic however, it's up to you):\r\n\r\n  if (player.current_life < player.minimum_life) {\r\n    // depends on how you want to handle this game mechanic, some examples:\r\n    //\r\n    // player.current_life = player.minimum_life // if you want to be killed by it\r\n    // or\r\n    // player.current_life = player.minimum_life + 1 // if you don't want to be killed by it\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // this code line below, is the adjustment to the 'player.life' String Attribute, as this is what the status attribute needs to use for its displayment, and since this is within the special 'changed' Script Attribute, it causes your status attributes to update, displaying the new/correct displayment of your 'life' stat:\r\n\r\n  player.life = \"Player Life: \" + player.current_life + \"/\" + player.maximum_life\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nif you're new to coding... this scripting example of mine probably scares you... but my point was just the concept of how it works... hopefully... you can kind-of follow the code and see the concept of how it works (again use my link at the top of my post, as it's a step by step guide on doing all

quest Text Adventure game*\r\n\r\nfirst, let's create our Attributes:\r\n\r\n'game' Game Object -> 'Attributes' Tab -> Attributes -> Add -> (see below, repeat as needed)\r\n\r\n(Object Name:

I needed a super flexible system that could make any number of combatants, both ally and enemy, and have them all execute different moves, with different stats and health. I did this by making a BaseFighterObject and stuck it in a debugroom, and when a fight starts I clone a bunch of it and put it in the Fight room. Permanent fighters - like, say, the main Player, or an important teammate you recruit - instead has one cloned and assigned to them at the start of the game as the FightingObject attribute.\r\n\r\nThis lets me use the FilterByAttribute(GetDirectChildren( stuff to search for Fighters with specific characteristics and make a super-flexible battle system. I can do AoE attacks that affect only enemies, only allies, only enemies that are Mechanical, etc. With the use of cloning a BuffBase object and such, I can even do robust buffs/debuffs with turn duration, or are permanent, last through fights, can be removed, do stuff when they run out etc, and a AbilityBase to make cooldowns and such for various enemy attacks.\r\n\r\nI am _exceedingly_ proud of the fight system I cooked up for my indev game.",

I needed a super flexible system that could make any number of combatants, both ally and enemy, and have them all execute different moves, with different stats and health. I did this by making a BaseFighterObject and stuck it in a debugroom, and when a fight starts I clone a bunch of it and put it in the Fight room. Permanent fighters - like, say, the main Player, or an important teammate you recruit - instead has one cloned and assigned to them at the start of the game as the FightingObject attribute.</p>\n<p>This lets me use the FilterByAttribute(GetDirectChildren( stuff to search for Fighters with specific characteristics and make a super-flexible battle system. I can do AoE attacks that affect only enemies, only allies, only enemies that are Mechanical, etc. With the use of cloning a BuffBase object and such, I can even do robust buffs/debuffs with turn duration, or are permanent, last through fights, can be removed, do stuff when they run out etc, and a AbilityBase to make cooldowns and such for various enemy attacks.</p>\n<p>I am <em>exceedingly</em> proud of the fight system I cooked up for my indev game.</p>\n\n",
