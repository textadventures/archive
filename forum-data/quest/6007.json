I couldn't get it to work for ages and finally realised that in code view my Show Menu which I had selected using the GUI view was showing as &quot;ShowMenu&quot; and was giving an in-line menu with hyperlinks. When I changed it to &quot;show menu&quot; (in code view) it worked.\n\nI found a few references to the two different types but nothing that said how to differentiate without going in to code view. I am not big on coding (too dumb for that!) and do most stuff in GUI which means that I would have to switch to code view to change this every time I wanted to use it. Is there a way to do it right in GUI?\n\nThanks!!\n\nP.S. It is after 11pm and I have been at work all day, so if there is an obvious answer to this I apologise  <!-- s:( --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /><!-- s:( -->",
