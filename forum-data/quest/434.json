The string variable works fine during the game (Inserting #V1name# in a sentence gives off the content of the string), but after I named the \"go to\" exit \"Travel to #V1name#\", all that appears is \"Travel to\" and the error log tells me \"'V1name' no such string defined\". Can you help out a little?\n\nThanks",
