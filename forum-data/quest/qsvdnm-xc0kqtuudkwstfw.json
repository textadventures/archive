This part is the first stage of the game and I'd focus on that before asking more questions.\r\n\r\nI don't know how objects and rooms work.\r\nDoes the codes from Gamebook work the same in Text Adventure?

      "EditableText": "(filler for getting my edited post, updated/posted)\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nI think (I've not used quest online, so could be wrong), unfortunately, not for the online editor: you can only open up individual/specific scripting Elements' scripting boxes for writing/editing in their code/scripting (for parts of your game/code only --- scripting Elements: an Object's Script-Attribute, Verbs, Turnscripts, Timers, Commands, Functions, etc scripting Elements), so you can't get access (with using online quest) to your entire game code, unless you download your online game file onto your computer:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/ (Elements: these are the main/\"physical\" things of Quest, some/many can do/hold scripting: some/many are scripting Elements)\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/types/ (Attribute Types / Data Types)\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/types/script.html (the Script Attribute)\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/quest_code.html\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/using_verbs.html\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/copy_and_paste_code.html (a section on online-vs-offline example with using the 'Function' Element from this link is shown below)\r\n\r\n```\r\nCreate a new function (commands are similar)\r\nRight click in the left pane, and select add function. Give it the right name (same capitalisation, etc.). Bottom of the stuff on the right is Script.\r\n\r\nClick on the seventh icon (Code view) if off-line.\r\n\r\nIf you are working on-line, click the “Code view” button at the bottom. You should now get a text box below. Just paste the code into this box.\r\n\r\nClick on Code view again, and you should see the normal Quest view. If you see some red text, something has gone wrong. Check that you copy-and-pasted the whole code and nothing but the code (though it could even be a mistake in the code). You may need to set the return type or add parameters - see what the forum post says. To add a parameter, just click on the plus by the word “Parameters”. Make sure you give the exact names specified and in the same order.\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nyou can actually create your own game with just notepad (or Apple: text editor), and if able (not sure how restricted/protected are: your job's/company's computers and/or their rules/policies), save it to a flash drive, then play it (or open and edit in its GUI/Editor) on your computer at home (need the quest software to play it and/or to have/use its GUI/Editor, of course)\r\n\r\nan example here of creating a default new game, (pretend I opened up notepad, or Apple: text editor), and am writing this to the notepad/Text-Editor file (NAME_OF_GAME_FILE.txt, but change its extension, to make it playable as a quest game with the quest software: NAME_OF_GAME_FILE.aslx)\r\n\r\n(I'm still using an older version of quest, so it might be slightly different from the newest version of quest)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"NAME_OF_YOUR_GAME\">\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"gameid\" type=\"string\">SOME_RANDOMLY_GENERATED_HASH_STRING</attr>\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"author\" type=\"string\">NAME_OF_AUTHOR</attr>\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"version\" type=\"string\">1.0</attr>\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"firstpublished\" type=\"string\">2019</attr>\r\n\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"room\">\r\n\r\n    <inherit name=\"editor_room\" />\r\n\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"player\">\r\n\r\n    <inherit name=\"editor_object\" />\r\n    <inherit name=\"editor_player\" />\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"parent\" type=\"object\">room</attr>\r\n\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nta-da, a default new game of quest has just been created!

You should now get a text box below. Just paste the code into this box.\n\nClick on Code view again, and you should see the normal Quest view. If you see some red text, something has gone wrong. Check that you copy-and-pasted the whole code and nothing but the code (though it could even be a mistake in the code).
