Noob here\r\nI'm making my first game ussing Quest, and I'm trying to figure out how to have something that can increase or decrease in value by script relative to the previous value\r\nWhat I mean by that is I'd like to have something like money where instead of just using scripts to set an attribute or variable value to a certain number, you can increase it by a certain amount. I'm trying to create lots of these \"variables\" for my first game where I'm going to have the player's actions/commands/items in inventory/etc. influence these variables to change NPCs' responses and actions to suit them. For example, I'd like a variable named 'Trust' that increases or decreases based on how you interact with a certain NPC, and I can use that to change the NPC's responses with if scripts and such.\r\nSo yeah\r\nThanks for helping uwu",
