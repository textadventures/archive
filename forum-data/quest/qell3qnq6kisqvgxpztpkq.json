It looks like `#text#` is somewhere that it's being treated as an expression rather than a command pattern.\r\n\r\nIf you're using a player-input text as a number, remember to use both `IsInt` and `ToInt`. So a command that gives the player a requested amount of money might look like:\r\n```\r\nif (IsInt (text)) {\r\n  msg (\"You gain $\" + text + \".\")\r\n  game.pov.money = game.pov.money + ToInt (text)\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"The amount of money must be a number.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(A common mistake is to assume that the player typed a number without checking)",
