Many hours have been spent and unfortunatly I can't trigger the event I need to make the end of game boss appear.\n\nI would like the boss to appear when the inventory contains 10 specific items. I tried making two doors, each requiring 5 keys. When the first is opened it moves to my &quot;warehouse&quot; and a second is swapped in its place. I then have it that opening the door triggers the boss. This failed, but I am unsure why (then again it is waaaaay past bed time).\n\n\nAny other ideas for making this happen, and of course as as a noob I am limited to the GUI......",
