      "EditableText": "Hey guys, been trying to do some coding for my game and think I may have uncovered two bugs (or I'm just not doing something right).\n\nFirst, let me specify this is a multiplayer game.\n\nI've set up some status variables for Health, Coins, etc. Most have a starting value of \"0\", but I wanted Health to start at 100.  When I put 100 (or any number for that matter) as a starting value, it still shows up in the game as \"0\".\n\nSecond, when trying to use status variables in the multiplayer game, I'm using the command Health[userid] to give each player their own array. This works fine if I use it as a \"command\", if I try to use this in a conditional statement, it will not display any values. Has anyone else experienced this?  Any help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks",
