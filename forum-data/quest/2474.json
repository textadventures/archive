The reason they can't be the same direction east to west is because my pictures of the street are different views. Everytime i click the box off to make a corresponding exit, it keeps coming back. The box auto checks itself after i uncheck it and leave the screen. So i keep ending up with 2 exits from each street to the same place.",
