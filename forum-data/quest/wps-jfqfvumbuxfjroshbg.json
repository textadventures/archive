I am a beginner coder, and I am 100% new to Quest. In other words, I have no idea what I'm doing. So why am I taking on such a huge project? I wish I had an answer. I'm just bored and have too much free time.\r\n\r\nAnyway, can someone please explain to me how to do what I'm trying to do in very simple terms? I need someone to tell me exactly where to put everything. Basically, talk to me like I'm a toddler. Feel free to be as condescending as you'd like.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated.",
