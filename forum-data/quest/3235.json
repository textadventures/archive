Just a curiosity question I have just used a create exit command for the first time, of which I am pleased that it was very easy to understand ( thanks to Alex for making this so) however underneath it shows reference to \n[ type &quot;optional&quot; and id &quot;optional&quot; ] I know that this is not detrimental to the game and I don't have to fill it in but as they say that curiosity killed the cat.

If you don't specify an id, one will be generated for you (every object has a unique name/id), and it would be a bit tricky to actually determine what it is.
