Ideally:\r\n\r\n1) The player should not be able to use the ```save``` command.\r\n2) The player would ```use``` a thing in order to save. Like a typewritter in RE.\r\na) The game should ask for confirmation of the save.\r\nb) If the player agrees, then the save is made.\r\n\r\nHow can I get this done?\r\nThanks in advance!",
