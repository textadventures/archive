      "EditableText": "Hello,\n\nIm searching for the best work flow for doing a text adventure game with a lot of branching dialogue. I like Quest because it can keep track of rooms and objects which seem to be a good fit for a text adventure which is focused on giving lots of player agency. But it will be focused on dialogue and not interacting with a lot of objects. \n\nThree candidates ive found so far: \nInklewriter - Very linear, novel like, used in banner saga\nTwine - Very visual - but uncertain how complex a game it can support. No keeping track of rooms.\nQuest - Rooms, but difficult dialogue creation?\nChat mapper - Awesome, but you need to export format to some game engine. Costs a pretty penny.\nInform7 - used to make Blue Lacuna, interesting english language programming language. Altogether different but hopefully works as well as the rest for publishing to different platforms?\n\nMight it be possible to find some great tool for writing dialogue and then important it to Quest, such as Chat Mapper? Or am I going about it all wrong?\n\nHow do you go about creating dialogue in your games?\n\nThank you for your help!\nChow",

You number the flowchart and write the dialogue in a word processor. I use yEd Graph Editor for just about everything - mapping my game out, puzzle dependency charts, everything. Carrion Fire has no dialogue trees, but I'd use it for that too.\n\nOnce you do this, it comes down to which software is easiest to program in. I've searched - for a long time - and nothing has beaten Quest.",
