[like the tutorial]\n\nobject one = 1kg\n\nobject two = 50kg\n\nobject three =  1000kg\n\nwhen I put the commant to look at object instead of having it say [object one weighs 1kg]  is there a way to set the weight between 1 and 49 to be &quot;light&quot; 50 to 999 to be &quot;moderatly heavy.&quot; and 1000+ to be &quot;Too heavy it is impossible to lift&quot;\n\n\nso if I look at object two it would say \n\nobject two is moderatly heavy.\n\n\nif anyone can help me with this I would be greatful\n\nthank you.",

In the else if check if weight &gt; 1000 and print &quot;it is moderately heavy&quot; if it is true.

If you need to check the weight of an object anytime outside the command, I recommend the second one.",

I had a weight set for the player then added a switch to read the weight and display a message of light medium heavy dependant on the numbers and then added an item the increaed the weight if you ate it so it worked! [/b:a0y1c43r]I think the second option is closer to what I want to do.\n\nbut let's say I wanted more steps than light moderate heavy.\n\nlooking at the help wiki I saw something called &quot;SWITCH&quot; where you can put quite a few in there\n\n0 = weightless\n1 = light\n2 = average\n3 = heavy\n4 = very heavy\n5 = extreamly heavy\n6 = unmoveable!\n\nect ect\n\nbut I have no idea how to pull that information into a printed message based on the current items number/weight\n\nlook at box1 [le't say box one is 3]\n\nand have it print out\n\n box1 is heavy\n\nso later I could add something to the box and have it become [4]\n\nbox1 is very heavy\n\nI aprecieate the info thank you.",
