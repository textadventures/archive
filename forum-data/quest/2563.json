Great job. \n\nI've been doing pretty good working with it despite the lack of full documentation ... but I have run into a problem that I can solve by making my own function, but before I go down that route I wanted to see if there is already something in place ... or at least an easier way to do it.\n\nWhat I want to do is run a random script from a script dictionary. I can think of a variety of uses for this ... anything from random spell effects to random encounters to random shop inventory.  \n\nSo is this functionality already in place and I just can't find it? or is there an easy way to do this? \n\nThanks in advance.",
