This all works.\r\n\r\nHowever the issue I have is that I want to regain the top half of the screen for text content in the rooms where the map is hidden, however with the hiding line all it does is just hide the map but keeps it's space occupying the screen which is not what I was hoping for. \r\n\r\nAnyone know how to do this on the gridPanel css?",
