Now, click 'Enter next command into string variable'. \n\nUnder 'String variable', type the name of the variable. I'll name it 'password' for now. We're not yet done, though.\n\nAdd a Select Case (You can add one by clicking the 'Script' menu on the top-left and clicking 'Add Select Case').

You can also click '#' the button on the top right of the text bar beside 'Select Case' and pick the 'password' string under 'Insert a string variable:'.\n\nOn the right, click the 'Add' button. Type the correct password beside 'Case:'. The script editor opens, revealing the Print a message script. Type correct then press the 'Add more' button on the bottom. For this, I'm going to set a flag on (under 'Variables'). Call the flag 'unlocked' for now.\n\nAdd another case, this time set it to 'Else:' and type 'Incorrect password, locking system.' and set a flag on (call the flag 'system_locked', for now).\n\nClick 'Ok.'\n\nNow, add another menu item. Name it emails. Add a information prompt if you haven't yet (It is on the bottom). Click the 'Close' button.\n\nAdd another menu and call it 'emails'. The information prompts is 'Emails'. Add a menu item called 'Inbox'. Here, you can add another menu with a list of emails. \n\nAdd another menu item called 'Outbox'.

      "HTML": "I'm going to edit the tutorial a bit now, and I hope this one's going to work.<br/><br/>First, make a menu (for the computer). Under 'Game', click 'Menus'. On the side, click the 'Add...' button. Name it whatever you want, for now, I'll name it computer menu. <br/><br/>The Menu Editor will open. On the right side, there are 5 buttons. Click 'Add...' and under 'Please enter the text to display for this menu choice:', type 'Unlock door'.<br/><br/>After that, the Script Editor will pop up. Click the '+' button beside 'Other'. Now, click 'Enter next command into string variable'. <br/><br/>Under 'String variable', type the name of the variable. I'll name it 'password' for now. We're not yet done, though.<br/><br/>Add a Select Case (You can add one by clicking the 'Script' menu on the top-left and clicking 'Add Select Case'). Next to 'Select Case:', type the name of the variable from earlier (password) in the center of '#'. You can also click '#' the button on the top right of the text bar beside 'Select Case' and pick the 'password' string under 'Insert a string variable:'.<br/><br/>On the right, click the 'Add' button. Type the correct password beside 'Case:'. The script editor opens, revealing the Print a message script. Type correct then press the 'Add more' button on the bottom. For this, I'm going to unlock an exit (the door!)<br/><br/>The script for the correct password should look something like this:<br/><pre><code>Print &quot;Correct&#46;&quot; <br/>Unlock the exit from &quot;Computer room&quot; to &quot;east&quot; <br/>Modify &quot;computer&quot;'s &quot;use&quot; action to &#46;&#46;&#46; Show the &quot;emails&quot; menu </code></pre><br/><br/>Add another case, this time set it to 'Else:' and type 'Incorrect password, locking system.' and set a flag on (call the flag 'system_locked', for now).<br/><br/>The script for the 'Else' case should look like this:<br/><pre><code>Print &quot;Incorrect password, locking system&#46;&quot; <br/>Set the flag &quot;system_locked&quot; to on </code></pre><br/><br/>Click 'Ok.'<br/><br/>Now, add another menu item. Name it emails. Add a information prompt if you haven't yet (It is on the bottom). Click the 'Close' button.<br/><br/>Add another menu and call it 'emails'. The information prompts is 'Emails'. Add a menu item called 'Inbox'. Here, you can add another menu with a list of emails. <br/><br/>Add another menu item called 'Outbox'. You can also add some emails here, if you want.<br/><br/>I've added new menus called 'inbox' and 'outbox' with the information prompt 'Inbox' and 'Outbox'. <br/><br/>On the emails menu, edit the script of both menu options and choose 'show a menu' from under 'Run script'. For inbox, run the 'inbox' menu. For outbox, run the 'outbox' menu.<br/><br/>Click 'Close' and edit the 'computer menu'. Click the 'Emails' menu options and click 'Edit...'. Choose the 'Show a menu' script and select the 'emails' menu.<br/><br/>Add a room (if you haven't already), then add an object. Name it 'computer'.
