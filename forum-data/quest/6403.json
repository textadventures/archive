However, they can become visible and listed with the command &quot;list&quot;. How can I go about doing this?\n\nI have tried making a command that makes the objects visible after the command is executed, but have no way of making it listed in the text field. Print list? Print object? List object? What's the one magic command that will list the visible objects in the room?\n\nThanks",
