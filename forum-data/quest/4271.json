However this seems to have confused the map system. I attempted to move the Cupboard object to the top level but that does not seem to be an option, I can only move it into other objects.\n\nSo a) can I fix my game? Could I edit the xml, or load it into the Windows version, then upload a fixed copy back? Would that create a new game on the website? I don't see a way to edit my game, just upload a new one, I'd rather keep my comments, views, url etc, if possible.\n\nb) is this a known bug?",
