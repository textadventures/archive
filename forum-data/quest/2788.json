What I couldn't find is how pixie made the score to appear score = 0/5 (I think I clicked on everything to trace it, and just didn't see it) ..... not sure if that is built in the library?  but since I am bringing to the discussion scoring, and there happens to be a library item created for this, then maybe understanding how library items can benefit ones game?? \n\n3) Randomization with scoring .... Often the best games are ones that have a chance for random results .. which is factored by ones score.  A simple example, is opening a box which [b:381swi1c]could[/b:381swi1c] explode ... how do I set a random number generator where if the number generated is larger then the players luck number would explode but if less then would not.  So if luck is 74 / 100 and the random number is 72 then the box will open safely.\n\nFor fun, In my ancient Basic (which really worked well for text adventures), it might look like this:\nrandomize\nluck = 74\na = int (rnd(0)*100)+1\nif a &gt; luck then life=life-10\n\nThank you for your time and replies,\nderekb",

LOL) ... when learning it (back in the Commodore days), there was something called REM which had no purpose to the actual game program, other then it 'rem'inded the programmer of any information ... and when I learn Basic, I would learn from example programs which included REM statements which gave insight on what a given line was doing (ie. REM This line initializes the randomizer and sets the random numbers highest number as 16).  \n\nI am sure, I will get it eventually ...
