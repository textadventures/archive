I'd say pick two things from that list and write out exactly how you want them to function. This way you aren't trying to go too many directions at once but you do have something to put time into if you get really stuck on one and are waiting to get some help, or just taking a break from it.\r\n\r\nThat said, for #4 Quest has a built in save/load feature unless you want something that isn't a standard save/load, and #10 is just a container unless you have some specific functionality planned for it.\r\n\r\nAs I suspect with your fairly extensive list you do have a plan here, and it's definitely important to expand on each section as much as you can. In coding there is almost always more than one way to create a system and which method is best can often be determined by how it has to interact with all of its parts. So the more details you can give on what exactly you want each thing to do the better.\r\n\r\nie: for #1 the guns, is your spare ammo being held in magazines or is it just going to be tracked per bullet? Will reloading discard partially spent magazines? How do you want your guns bullet capacity and currently loaded ammo to be shown to the player? etc...\r\n\r\nEDIT: also what XanMag said above me is true, especially if this is your first game, simpler is generally better. As you're going through your game systems I'd suggest really looking at all the parts and trying to simplify things where you can. At the very least creating a test game file to try out specific scripts and such is not a bad idea. For example I have a handful of test games I build either a single system or just partial systems in to test how scripts or certain techniques work out in practice. I never intend to release them or turn them into anything resembling a finished game but it can be helpful for experimenting without cluttering up your main game files.",
