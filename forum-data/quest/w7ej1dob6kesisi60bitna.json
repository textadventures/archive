      "EditableText": "I was in a rush to get feedback too when I made \"Xanadu - The World's Only Hope, Part 2 - Revenge\", the greatest text adventure game ever written (wink, wink... laughs a little... cries a little). Eleven months later it has a play short of 200 (that's 0.62 plays per day and 20-30 of those are probably mine!).  lol.  Bottom line, you really need to write for you and no one else.  The market for TA's is pretty small.  If you think it is good, then most likely, others will to.  If others think it is good, plays will start to roll in.  Don't expect 1000's of plays unless you make it on the editor's choice list or if you have made a cult game (like those goofy giantess games or undertale or my little pony bleck or warrior cats or any other such filth).  Or, just make a smutty porn game.  People will flock to those...\r\n\r\nIt's unlikely that people will play, let alone comment and provide immediate feedback, so soon after publishing.  If I were you, I would complete the game, test it about a gazillion times, publish it privately, share the link on a post on the forum with a note that you are looking for beta-testers, and then go back and alter your story based on the feedback you get.  If you are at roadblock that prevents you from continuing based on player decisions, then you should make as many avenues as possible to account for those possible decisions.  It is tedious, yes, but it is what the best games are made of.  My advice... write, write, write, write... think of inside-the-box choices players might want to make and account for those options... write, write, write, write... think of outside-the-box choices players might want to make and write some more.  Also, a LOT of people are really into playing a WIP.  I love beta-testing but I don't like playing partially finished games.  Just my opinion, but I bet a bunch of people share it.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  Also, there are other communities outside of textadventure.co.uk that you could advertise in too. , like intfiction and ifdb.tads.org, but again, playing a near finished or finished game is much preferred by those who would be willing to test.",
