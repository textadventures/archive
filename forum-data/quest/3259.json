So here's the basic concept.\nYou control up to two &quot;Main Characters&quot;, and have a deck of cards for each. You get to pick and choose which cards go in the deck before the face-off starts.\nI've figured the easiest way to do this would be to create objects for all the cards, with attributes for each of the cards to tell you about them, and simply move them around from a &quot;deck&quot; object, to a &quot;hand&quot; object, and later put in/on a &quot;battlefield&quot; object. Any cards that you own that are not in either of these are simply possessed, and are being carried in your inventory.\n\nHowever, I'm having trouble modifying the &quot;Inventory&quot; command in the core file.
