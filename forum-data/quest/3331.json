      "EditableText": "Hello everyone hope all is ok . I was working on my game earlier on today and everything was working fine when I checked the latest work, so I decided to give it a rest and come back to it later. I left it running on the table as usual, but when I came back and decided to look at it again it would not run and greyed over, with a message (quest has stopped running) so the only way to start it up again was to double click it on the desk top. It loaded up the game but it would not run again. I've worked on it now for nearly a year so you can imagine my panic. Lucky enough I've got two backups on different sticks. So I deleted the game off the computer and installed the backup. To my delight it worked. Has anyone else had this problem? Thanks Terry <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
