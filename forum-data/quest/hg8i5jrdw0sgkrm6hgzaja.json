So for the object that I would want to give to the n.p.c.s  I would run handle objects individually under give this to (other object). I would then put in the object names for each npc and then run the script that happens when you give it to that npc correct? So TLDR for example; I give npc Sally a paintbrush she says \"this reminds me of my childhood.\"  I gave the paintbrush to npc George he says \"My daughter always loved painting as a kid, it brings back better times.\" (that's essentially what I am trying to do right now.)",
