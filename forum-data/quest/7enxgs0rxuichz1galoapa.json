I just want to print a message saying it doesn't open.  \r\n\r\nI tried making it a container either:\r\n1) Closed with an 'on open message' defined and an 'on open script' that closed it again but you could put items into it which I didn't want (I wanted a message saying you couldn't).\r\n2) Open but then the 'on open message' doesn't work as the open command prints 'it is already open' but at least then I had a 'on inserting item' script that printed a warning and didn't allow objects to be put in it.  \r\n\r\nI just want to give a custom you message in both cases (open and put object in it).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I have containers that work fine but when the container is on the ground and open the objects in it are listed as if they were on the ground.  Is there an automatic way of getting it to say 'containing: <object1>, <object2>' etc ?  Like it does if you are carrying the container.\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nSimon\r\n",
