BEFORETURN is from the singleplayer code so it doesn't have any reference to an ID. My only thought on how to get whatever you are doing without modifying your existing code too much would be to try the built in function $thisobject$, that might attach an id or object to the context of which it is run.\n\nMy other suggestion would be to use the \"with\" option after your before turn OR somewhere creatively in it, to attempt to run it in context to the executing player.",
