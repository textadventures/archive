This will cause the description to only be shown if the current command is `look`.\r\n\r\nIf you have a room whose description is a script, you would do the same thing, just putting the whole thing inside an `if` block testing the condition `game.pov.currentcommandpattern = look`.\r\n\r\nThis is simple enough, but you need to do it for every room. Could be time consuming if your game is large.\r\nOn the other hand, using this method you could put something in the 'else' block, if you want to display a shorter description when the player enters some rooms.\r\n\r\n**Option 2: Modifying the 'look' command**\r\n\r\n> I can change the room description to 0, but it wont show it how I want it\r\n\r\nThis is a useful idea. If you set the room description to 0, but then modify the \"look\" command so that it changes this setting before showing the description, it could do what you want.\r\n\r\nIf you find the \"look\" command (the desktop editor allows you to show hidden elements from libraries and edit them, but I'm not sure how), you will see that its script is simply:\r\n```\r\nShowRoomDescription\r\n```\r\nYou can change this to:\r\n```\r\ngame.autodescription_description = 1\r\nShowRoomDescription\r\ngame.autodescription_description = 0\r\n```\r\nSo then the actual description is element 1 in the room description when the player is looking around, and 0 the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nIn this case, if you have a room where the description contains something the player would immediately notice, you could put `game.autodescription_description = 1` in the \"before first enter\" script for the room, `game.autodescription_description = 0` in the \"on enter\" (so that it doesn't stay as 1 when they move to another room) and then use the method described in option 1 above.",
