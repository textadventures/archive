      "EditableText": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'd like to create an educational quiz for the public on a specific subject. I'd like it to be multiple choice where the player racks up a score, possibly against the clock. If possible I'd like to record the score and time to create a leader board, but I'm happy to manually create this providing I can capture the score and time, if this is possible. I'm guessing I then have some options as to how to display the quiz: via textadventure website as a downloadable game, as an HTML quiz hosted on textadventure, ported as an app (I'm happy to pay for this service) or hosted on my own website.\r\n\r\nWhilst I can build the quiz in Quest (Windows) I'm wondering what the best platform is to create this quiz. Should it be done through Quest as a text adventure or an adventure book? Would Squiffy be preferable or should I create it via textadventure as HTML? Does Squiffy or the HTML game-builder allow me to keep scores and times and, if they do, do I have to have a good understanding of javascript to build these features myself?\r\n\r\nMy preference is to build it using Quest (text or book, which one?) and then get it converted to an app, or host it on my own website, so I'm assuming Squiffy.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?",

      "EditableText": "Hi DarkLizerd. Yeah, the creation of the quiz should be straightforward with no-return exits. Could be fun including hints etc too. I'm more interested in working out which platform will port best to a public-facing quiz, i.e. as an app or hosted html. Bear in mind every page will have an image and I want to keep a score. I'm leaning towards the desktop version of a gamebook, but it doesn't have the 'score' feature included and I'm not sure how easy that is to port to an app.",
