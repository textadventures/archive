I guess you could use the shell command, right? Problem is in getting the variables from one game to the other though. That could be shell'd through a batch file to write the variables but then how would you go about reading them back again?",

Was just wondering. \n\nMy fear is if I keep adding and adding to the game (a.k.a. like a Mudd or Muck) that at some point I'd run out of space. I seriously doubt I'll get the file up to the current limit though, but I am a bit wasteful in my over use of (hidden) objects in each room to account for the player examining things out of the room description that you can't necessarily take but might want to know more about. So at some point if I get enough really really object packed rooms I don't know if it'll bog down the CPU or crash the game or what. I worry about this stuff because I used to be a Lotus Notes database programmer and learned the hard way what the database did when it got too full. \n\nJust bought the registered versoin of QDK the other day and have to say I really like it. Though I used to write all my script in text editors and for some languages I prefer it, I like having a script editor like this for writing text adventures. Seems to make it easier to see the object oriented programming in a visual format than wading through huge blocks of code. I messed with TADS a little and though it has its advantages, it doesn't seem to have any kind of script editor like this, so that's why I went with QDK. Anyhow back to work I guess.",
