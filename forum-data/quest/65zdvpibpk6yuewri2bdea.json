I want to have a \"scenery\" super-room which will basically reflect what is going on in the background of several various rooms. Traffic, weather, and so on. Also, I would love to have several rooms like this, not just one. I am wondering what would be the easiest way to implement this? Maybe I could create one object and leave references to this object and let it display in each room which has the reference? \r\n\r\nI will try to look it up on my own, but I suspect there might be an easy answer to this....",

In this case whenever you enter the child room, the script will look up the parent and Message the description of the objects located in parent? that will do probably.",
