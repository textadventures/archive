Thank you.  However, I was staring at my screen thinking it was not working... I mean Jerry (That is my NPC name.) never left the room.  I was like crap, I must have done something wrong then something caught my eye.  Jerry was arriving and leaving my &quot;Places and Objects&quot; list on the right.  But he never left my actual game screen or it's original place/line on the screen.  I kept clicking on him trying to look at him and it was telling me, &quot;I can't see that.&quot;, but he stayed clickable.  I have seen other games where it informs the player that &quot;NPC has arrived from the N.&quot; and then &quot;NPC has departed to the S.&quot;.  How do I go about doing that?  That way my screen is being updated and the lines move up and eventually out of site.  I could just keep typing &quot;L&quot; or &quot;Look&quot;, but that seems unnatural for the player.  Where would I stick a print message in all that code?  (Assuming it is a print message... or if dashes or slashes must be used etc.)  Also what if I wanted to talk to Jerry.  Right now I have him on 10 second intervals of roaming, because I want my reactions quick when testing.  But what if I wanted to talk to him?  If I tried to interact with him and was actually in a conversation with him, when his 10 seconds are up regardless of what he is doing, will he just leave again?  And if so, how do I stop him from leaving when I was in an active conversation with him?\n\nHere is the code that I reworked for my testing game...

Thank you.  However, I was staring at my screen thinking it was not working... I mean Jerry (That is my NPC name.) never left the room.  I was like crap, I must have done something wrong then something caught my eye.  Jerry was arriving and leaving my &quot;Places and Objects&quot; list on the right.  But he never left my actual game screen or it's original place/line on the screen.  I kept clicking on him trying to look at him and it was telling me, &quot;I can't see that.&quot;, but he stayed clickable.  I have seen other games where it informs the player that &quot;NPC has arrived from the N.&quot; and then &quot;NPC has departed to the S.&quot;.  How do I go about doing that?  That way my screen is being updated and the lines move up and eventually out of site.  I could just keep typing &quot;L&quot; or &quot;Look&quot;, but that seems unnatural for the player.  Where would I stick a print message in all that code?  (Assuming it is a print message... or if dashes or slashes must be used etc.)  Also what if I wanted to talk to Jerry.  Right now I have him on 10 second intervals of roaming, because I want my reactions quick when testing.  But what if I wanted to talk to him?  If I tried to interact with him and was actually in a conversation with him, when his 10 seconds are up regardless of what he is doing, will he just leave again?  And if so, how do I stop him from leaving when I was in an active conversation with him?<br/><br/>Here is the code that I reworked for my testing game...
