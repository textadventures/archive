I don't want it to be set to a specific number, I only want it to increase the more times this command is being called.\r\n\r\n<code style=\"color: inherit\">Object.attribute = Object.attribute + 2</code> is the usual form.\r\n\r\nIf you want to input this in the GUI, you will find it under \"Variables\" → \"Set a variable or attribute\". Put `Object.attribute` in the left box, and `Object.attribute + 2` in the right. Make sure the type is set to \"Expression\"; otherwise you'll be entering the command `Object.attribute = \"Object.attribute + 2\"` which doesn't work.\r\n\r\nNote that you can only use this if the attribute is an integer – you will need to set it to zero (or whatever its starting value is) before you can add something to it.\r\n\r\nYou could also do it using <code style=\"color: inherit\">set (Object, \"attribute\", Object.attribute + 2)</code>, which is generated by \"Set an object's attribute (named by an expression)\" in the GUI.\r\n\r\n> I also want to check for a range of integer values, for example if the value is currently anywhere between 0 and 2 and tried this:\r\n\r\n`and` takes two boolean statements (things which can be `true` or `false`) and tells you if they're both true.\r\n\r\nWhat you want is one of:\r\n* <code style=\"color: green\">if (Object.attribute = 0 or Object.attribute = 1 or Object.attribute = 2) {</code>\r\nor\r\n* <code style=\"color: green\">if (Object.attribute >= 0 and Object.attribute &lt;= 2) {</code>\r\nor\r\n* <code style=\"color: green\">if (Object.attribute &lt;= 2) {</code> if you don't need to check for negatives.\r\n\r\nIf you want to check for several values that aren't consecutive numbers, it might be easier to use `switch`. Like this:\r\n```\r\nswitch (Object.attribute) {\r\n  case (0) {\r\n    msg (\"The attribute is zero\")\r\n  }\r\n  case (1,3,5,7) {\r\n    msg (\"The attribute is a low odd number\")\r\n  }\r\n  case (2,4,6) {\r\n    msg (\"The attribute is a low even number\")\r\n  }\r\n  default {\r\n    msg (\"The attribute is 8 or more\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou can have as many options as you want in each `case`, and as many cases as you need. If there's a lot of different numbers that count, it can be worth using `switch` even if you only need one `case`.",
