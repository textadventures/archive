      "EditableText": "Hey there!\n\nI have been wondering if anyone can tell me what code should i write for showing the amount of gold in my inventory upon looking at the gold in my inventory? The way I added gold into my game was via attributes/integrer. Whenever I find gold I just write the following code: player.gold = player.gold + 100. And then i get 100 gold. It appears neatly in my bar under the health, but I wish to be able to write a command: examine gold/look at gold and then get a description: &quot;you have xx amount of gold in your inventory.\n\nCan anyone help me with that? There has to be a simple code to show this. I tried ListObjectContents (this), but this only gives me a list of objects i am carrying in my inventory. Basically it just tells me You are carrying gold, but it doesnt tell me the amount. I need to list the integrer value of the amount of gold. Thanks in advance.",
