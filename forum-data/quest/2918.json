All through the game I have been using  the look command to look at all objects, as well as look at and its worked great. But now the only command I can use  is look at. I have looked at the lookat command and that seems fine. \nExample (look at #object#; x #object#; examine #object#; exam #object#; ex #object#; look #object#), but now it will not work. Hope this is an easy fix otherwise I will have to start over.   <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\" /><!-- s:roll: -->",
