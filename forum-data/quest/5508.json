So suppose the game has two rooms, A and B, and a data file with rooms C, D and E. When the player saves, all five rooms will be saved.\n\nNow you update your game, adding rooms F and G to the data file. The player reloads the save game, with rooms A to E. You need some way to recognise that the game has been reloaded. I am not aware of a way to do that, but as a last resort, the player could type a REOAD command. That would start the file reload process.\n\nThat process would have to recognise rooms C, D and E are already there, but to add F and G. If all you are doing is adding (and that would include adding exits to existing rooms), that should be (relatively) easy. If you want to change something, you need to think about whether the player has already changed an attribute on that object. Not trivial, but certainly doable.\n\nI am not sure how scripts will work in your data files - as far as I know you cannot convert text (from a file) into a script. That may mean you need all your scripts defined in your original, either as types (and I would use types heavily), or as attributes that you assign to new objects.\n\nUse the game.publishfileextensions attribute to define which file types Quest will include in your game.\n\nBefore you get very far at all, upload your game and check it works on-line.
