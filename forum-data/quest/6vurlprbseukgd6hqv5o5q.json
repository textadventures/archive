I have the Quest text editor installed but whenever I go to open it, it will show up on the taskbar and I will receive no error messages yet the actual window will not show up. When I click on the icon on the task bar I can see the window for a brief moment as if it's opening on another monitor but I only have one monitor. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled the program twice and restarted my PC several times. Anyone know anything about this? ",
