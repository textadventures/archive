I have quite a few messages popping up at various places in my game and I'm having a bit of a nightmare making everything format nicely with proper line breaks (I've set the various newline options in the  Room Descriptions tab in the game object, but there is still tweaking required to prevent either lack of line breaks or too many line breaks).\r\n\r\nThanks!",
