      "EditableText": "This is probably a very dumb question! But thank you in advance!\r\n\r\nI have a question about containers: specifically about adding objects to a container. I have no idea what coding to use to restrict the “add” to just one or a few objects. I feel like I should be using “switch” or running an attribute or soemthing similiar, I just don’t know how to impliment it. \r\n\r\nFor instance: I have a lantern that contains a little fire spirit. It can be taken out of the lantern. I also want the player to be able to put it back in. But I don’t want them to be able to put other things into the lantern, such as a book or something. It’s not necessary to put the fire spirit back into the lantern, and obviously not a big deal if the player takes the time to shove large things into smaller things because they want to? But I’d like to learn! So just in general, how do I create a way to restrict items?\r\n\r\nI don’t have much knowledge of Quest beyond basic stuff, and I can usually find a work around. Any help is welcome, especially if you can dumb it down a little for me as I am not very good with code! I am using the browser version if that changes anything. ",
