I feel much more comfortable working with Qdk, but I still cant get it where i can add, subtract, multiply, or divide status variables. \nI keep getting a run time error 13. \nIf you would be willing to tell me how to fix this, or to give me a better description on how to put it in with ASL coding I would be very happy.",
