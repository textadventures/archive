I suggest putting underlines in your properties - and perhaps using the instr() function to check for underlines in the command - or dots.)\r\n\r\nAnd Freak, you are also right that the one action - wizzywozzling - for an object is fairly silly... But what about &quot;throw&quot;, surely if you use it once then it's still a fairly common action.
