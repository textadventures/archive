You can't just throw it willy-nilly everywhere you go. You know? \n\nSo my story is attached at the bottom. Im looking to make the grenade be able to throw at specific items that are allowed for it to be tossed. For example, if I added a rock and a tree to the room; I want the player to be able to throw the grenade at the rock. Having the rock explode and disappear from the scenery. \n\nif the player decided to throw it at the three.... well I wouldn't want that. So a message that would say 'you can't throw it there' would be something nice. \n\nI'm assuming this might be somewhere along the lines of the Verb: throw or creating an object type where it can be assigned to an objects attribute for both rock and grenade (kind of like connecting the two so that if you typed throw at another object it wont work) \n\nlet me know if this is possible please.\nnew Quest is pretty bad ass too by the way.",
