I've been implementing my first &quot;real&quot; room, adding both scenery and real objects. Once, I tried &quot;use&quot; on one of the objects (one I wanted to implement &quot;use&quot; for), and it brought up a &quot;on what&quot; list. I had seen that in some other games, but hadn't realized it was a default thing.\n\nThen I discovered that it happened for all of my objects, even the scenery ones.

That way, you only need to turn on what you actually want to enable for an object. But &quot;use&quot; is not only the other way around (no default message), but the default behavior is something I think almost nobody would actually want to have happen, since it just gives you a blanket list of objects (not even necessarily a constrained list of actually usable ones). It could be said that that aids players, but I think it's the other way around. If the player types &quot;use X&quot; and it gives them a list of options, and *none* of the options actually work, then it just gives the user a red herring to chase, since it seems the game is offering some clue or constraint (it implies &quot;use&quot; has meaning when it might very well not).\n\nMost well designed games I've seen here have managed to cut that off. I assume it's either by making some sort of &quot;non-usable&quot; type to inherit from, or by going to each object and implementing some sort of message. While those are both possible, it seems a lot of work for budding game authors to have to go through just to disable a feature they didn't want to begin with.\n\nI personally would love to see &quot;use&quot; handled like room descriptions: make the pop up list an option, but by default have it print a &quot;You can't use that.&quot; message.\n\nThat's my take, anyway.
