I had rather assumed that if I select one of the 13 base fonts in Quest and didn't pick a web font, that the nearest available would be used.

A 'base font' must also be selected from the 13 safe families offered (as defined by w3schools). The base font is only used if the game is played without an internet connection.\r\n\r\nWithin a game, it is also possible to change the web or base font and the font size dynamically.\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm experiencing, which I think just cropped up in the last week is that the Quest games I play on my computer, which is connected to the internet, all default to the same font and same font size (looks like Times 15). Also, if a game script attempts to change the font or font size it has no effect. I don't think this is a direct Quest problem as I have the same version of the Quest system running on my laptop and it is fine there. There was a Windows 8 update on 25 Jan, which may be the cause of this issue. Any suggestions for how to sort out this problem would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nBTW, I also see that the room name in the location bar uses the base font rather than the web font and that IS being set as selected?",
