I have built room with object, added pictures and sound files.\r\n\r\nNow I want to question the students about the facts than they have read.  I don't know the logic behind or a method to do this.    They will have to ask for something (gold) then I will respond with a question.  If they get the question correct I'll give them gold, if their answer is incorrect I need to put them back in the room where they can re-read the facts.   Also, if they get gold I need to keep a running total.      So, building the game has been easy, but I've hit a wall.  Thank You    Gary",
