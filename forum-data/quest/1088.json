My game is beginning to get quite large and I have noticed that after working on a new portion (in QDK) that when I go back and play through some of the earlier work, that strange things have happened.  For example, an object such as a coat in the third room of the game is no longer available for interaction.  The item shows up on the right side of the screen but when you try to look/examine/etc Quest can not see it.  The only way to fix this that I have found is to remake the item and fix all the scripts associated with it.  Why, if the coat has worked fine for three months, does it fail to work when the portion of the game I was working on had nothing to do with that room or the coat.  I suspect that it might have to do with synonyms...but I'm not sure.  Advise me...please.",
