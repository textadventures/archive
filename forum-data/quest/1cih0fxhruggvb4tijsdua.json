Now I know I can change hyperlink colours in other situations, and really, I don't feel I even need the hyperlink to show up,  as I already have a centred message telling the player to press any key. But I get a <b><span style=color:blue>Continue...</span></b> that appears in the corner of my page.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to prevent this little message coming up with the use of the 'Wait For Key Press, Then' or some way to change the message or colour? On another note, is there a way to make things occur with only the press of a specific key? Say, Press W to Continue? Not something I need, just curious - although I assume that would be something to do with input.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!",
