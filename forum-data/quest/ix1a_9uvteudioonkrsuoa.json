Well, I am not that enthusiastic and, all things being considered I have decided to stay with Quest. But I had noticed a gentleman named Aaron A. Reed who had written a short extension (library for Quest users) for \"dynamic rooms\", a concept that made me think of Pixie's \"Deeper\" game.\r\nI have \"translated\" Mr Reed's extension from Inform 7 to a Quest library (It is more a complete rewriting than a translation, actually, Inform's \"natural language\"  being in that case very complex and contorted, much more than any programming language I know of - but the basic concept is Mr Reed's and I have to acknowledge it).\r\n\r\n- I have published the game on http://textadventures.co.uk under the name \"MazeTVI\", my name being Thierry Videlaine. Any feedback would be appreciated.\r\n- I must add some new features to the library, and then I will make it public with Mr Reed's consent, although I am not aware of any restrictions placed on the re-use of his work.\r\n\r\nThierry\r\n",
