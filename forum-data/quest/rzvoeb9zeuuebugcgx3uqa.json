If the player decided to spend all his time in room 1 then the character would not appear as the player needs to be out of room 1. If I used a \"when entering a certain room\" to trigger this new character event then the player might not go into the certain room or might go into the room at the start of the game which triggers the character's arrival too soon.\r\nI need a bit of time for the player to explore the house, especially exploring room 1 before the character arrives.
