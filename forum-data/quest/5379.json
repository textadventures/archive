I've decided to add pictures for backgrounds (even if they cannot be removed) with dynamic resize to fit the game window, and I've been able to set the transparency for the GamePanel. I've also been able to change the font to another one and re-size it, even if, and I don't know why, after a while it gets set back to the &quot;Press Start 2P&quot; font.\nHowever I haven't been able, in any way, to change the text/foreground colour, and I really need it for plot reasons :/ \nI don't need to change it just for a single message, but for everything, from room descriptions to exits to messages.\n\nI would really appreciate some help here, this thing is driving me crazy...\n\nThank you all in advance, and forgive me if this looks trivial to you (and also for my italian english, I'm trying to improve :p )",
