During the board game the players earn Time/hours, and if for example they choose 'Ask him about the suitcase' I need the script to subtract -1 hour.\r\nAnd, the players can only choose two of the three to four options in each room.\r\n\r\nBasically, what I'd love to use Quest for is to show the player a room (essentially a picture of the room with a discription) and then three to four options that cost something (hours) and hides the already used options.\r\n\r\nIt would be absolutely amazing if someone would write to me just the basics of how to accomplish this.\r\nThank you,\r\nCarsten.",
