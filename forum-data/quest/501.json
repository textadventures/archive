I want the paper to be invisible and unavailable until after the table has been examined.\n\nFor the paper, I have checked off \"invisible\" and \"unavailable\" on interactions tab.\n\nFor the table, I run a script when the table is examined.  It prints a message, reveals the paper, and makes the paper accessable.\n\nWhen I test the game, I examine the table and the paper is revealed.  But when I try to look at the paper, it says \"I can't see that here\".\n\nWhat have I missed?\n\nThanks.",
