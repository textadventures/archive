I used the show menu thing from Quest Docs' Character Creation but can't figure out how the person will reply to the player's answer.\r\nShould I use set attribute or set flag? or something different?\r\n\r\nHelp me, please.",

I chose to print a message that included Minnie's response. She mentions five things you could ask her about. I printed it as a numbered list.\r\n5. I added a 'Get input, then' script, followed by a 'Switch' script.\r\n6. In the 'Switch' script, I discovered an absolutely beautiful bit of code... If you type in LCase(result) in the Switch box, it will take whatever the player types in and make it all lowercase!! If you do this, you do not need to worry about (or account for) a player that types in all CAPS or uses correct capitalization. CATS = cats, Cats = cats, CAtS = cats. It's a nice little tool!\r\n7. Under the 'Switch' box there is a plus sign next to the word 'Cases:' Click on that.\r\n8a. For option 1 in the menu, I added this as the case \"1\",\"one\",\"tutorial\",\"this tutorial\",\"game\",\"the game\",\"the tutorial\"\r\n8b. What this does is it accounts for anything that the player may type in that indicates that they want to talk about the first thing in your homemade menu. I repeated this basic procedure for the next five cases.\r\n9. When the player types in a response that matches one of your cases, you need to add a script that runs the appropriate response.\r\n10. Be sure to add a default response. A default response will take care of anything the player types in that does not match one of the cases.",
