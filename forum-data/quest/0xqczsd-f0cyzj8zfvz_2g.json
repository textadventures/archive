Is there a way I can have the game tell what platform it's on and display something different, or force the interface to be the same for both. Let me know if you have any ideas. Thanks!",

It won't change immediately; so I'd recommend checking if that attribute is already set, and if not call whereAmI and then create a script attribute `game.changedquestplatform`, which will be run as soon as Quest gets a response from the frontend to recognise what kind of device it's on.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you're already using javascript code to adjust the layout, you could have it look at the `platform` javascript variable to see what kind of device it thinks it is on.",
