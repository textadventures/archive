I accidentally nested something in itself and the game was not a happy camper at all. lol. I do have a few functions that loop based on player responses for character creation (Basically, confirm the input was correct for their name, if not, get input again and confirm, etc...) but I'm not sure how I can write up a function that will call each chapter of the game. Right now I have two functions I'm trying to work with, gameSetup and gamePrologue. If there's some way I can write up a function that'll constantly check for the completion of gameSetup before it calls gamePrologue, that would be awesome but I can't think of it for some reason :(\r\n\r\n@bergedorfcacher\r\nRight, basically that's what I'm going for but I'm not sure what's keeping it from working.

I'm not sure why, but quest just keeps going while waiting for input, so instead of completing the character setup (which is nested in function1) it'll ask for the players name and then give them a room description.
