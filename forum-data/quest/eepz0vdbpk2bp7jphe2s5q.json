      "EditableText": "Create a textadventure named markusmon\r\nCreate room2\r\nOn room object, select exit tab, create north path to room2\r\nat room2, create an object named \"marpikachu\"\r\nuntick visible checkbox to make marpikachu invisible\r\nat room, script tab, enter room, code the following\r\n```\r\nif (RandomChance(50)) {\r\n  MakeObjectVisible (marpikachu)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**This means the player will be rewarded for repeatedly exploring your game rooms, just like the original game intended**\r\n\r\n__________________________________\r\n\r\nAt marpikachu object, select verbs tab, add in a new verb called \"catch\"\r\nIn the catch verb, code:\r\n```\r\nif (RandomChance(50)) {\r\n  AddToInventory (marpikachu)\r\n  msg (\"You have successfully caught the pokemon\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  MakeObjectInvisible (marpikachu)\r\n  msg (\"Unfortunately, the pokemon have ranaway\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Why play a monster catcher game if you can't catch them,\r\nso definitely add the catch verb in**\r\n\r\nThere are two ways the player can catch marpikachu\r\n1. They can simply click on the \"catch\" verb button\r\n2. They can type in parser command \"catch marpikachu\"\r\n\r\nBut most people dun understand parser commands,\r\nso create a help object in room and add the description:\r\ntype parser command \"catch marpikachu\" to catch pokemons\r\n\r\nOf course, you can add other helpful advice like if the player explores the game,\r\nthey can discover more previously hiding pokemons\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\n**FAQ: But, there is no benefit in catching monsters?**\r\nWell, we can make it easier to catch pokemons if we have more pokemons\r\n\r\nIn player object, select attributes tab, add in \"power\" attribute and assign it from string to int \"0\"\r\n\r\nGo back to the catch verb and upgrade it to\r\n```\r\nif (RandomChance(50+player.power)) {\r\n  AddToInventory (marpikachu)\r\n  msg (\"You have successfully caught the pokemon\")\r\n  player.power = player.power+1\r\n  msg (\"This pokemon gives you +1 power\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  MakeObjectInvisible (marpikachu)\r\n  msg (\"Unfortunately, the pokemon have ranaway\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, after catching marpikachu, the player now have 51% chance to catch the other pokemons,\r\nso, this is the benefit for catching monsters,\r\nbut eventually, the player will become too powerful,\r\nso you will have to change the code of the first line to\r\n```\r\nif (RandomChance(20+player.power)) {\r\n```\r\nThis is 21% catch rate\r\nBut this code is written only on powerful monsters like marmewtwo,\r\nso that the whole game makes sense,\r\nand you do not have to edit previous codes that you have already written\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n**FAQ: But the game is too easy, just catch more monsters and hoard them in your inventory to become stronger**\r\nCreate a turn script and name it energy,\r\ntick the checkbox of \"Enabled when the game begins\"\r\ncode the following:\r\n```\r\nfirsttime {\r\n  player.energy = 100\r\n}\r\nplayer.energy = player.energy-player.power\r\nmsg (\"Energy: \"+player.energy)\r\nif (player.energy<1) {\r\n  MoveObject (game.pov, room)\r\n  msg (\"The player have too little energy and fainted\")\r\n  msg (\"You are sent back to the starting area\")\r\n  player.energy = 100\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe first time code sets the player to have energy, similar to how we setup player's power\r\nEvery time the player does something, he loses energy equals to his power equals to the number of pokemons he have,\r\ntherefore, he is encouraged to have lesser pokemons, rather than more\r\n\r\nSo, go back to marpikachu, at inventory tab,\r\nat \"after dropping the object\", code:\r\n```\r\nplayer.power = player.power-1\r\nmsg (\"You have released this pokemon and lost 1 power\")\r\n```\r\nNow the player can strategize what pokemons to keep and what to skip,\r\nmake sure to have some pokemons to have higher power than the others\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n**The gameplay is too linear, there is only 1 attribute \"power\",\r\nthe player doesn't really have any choices to formulate strategy**\r\n\r\nIn player object, select attributes tab, add in \"sight\" attribute and assign it from string to int \"0\"\r\nChange the very first code that we learned, how to make monsters visible on enter room to:\r\n```\r\nif (RandomChance(50+player.sight)) {\r\n  MakeObjectVisible (marpikachu)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo for harder monsters like marzapdos whom is hiding above the clouds,\r\nmake them harder to be spotted\r\n```\r\nif (RandomChance(20+player.sight)) {\r\n  MakeObjectVisible (marzapdos)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo to spot marzapdos, we only have 20% chance of seeing it every time we enter the room,\r\nbut if we change our strategy to have more \"sight\" than \"power\",\r\nwe can find more monsters easier\r\n\r\nMake sure to start adding monsters that gives sight rather than power,\r\nor perhaps, even a hybrid one, why not?\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n**But I want to see my monsters fight**\r\nIn player object, select attributes tab, \r\nadd in \"monster\" attribute and assign it as a string\r\nadd in \"skill\" attribute and assign it as a string\r\n\r\nGo back to catch verb and upgrade it\r\n```\r\nif (RandomChance(50+player.power)) {\r\n  AddToInventory (marpikachu)\r\n  msg (\"You have successfully caught the pokemon\")\r\n  player.power = player.power+1\r\n  msg (\"This pokemon gives you +1 power\")\r\n  player.monster = \"marpikachu\"\r\n  player.skill = \"Pika zap zap zap\"\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  MakeObjectInvisible (marpikachu)\r\n  msg (\"Unfortunately, the pokemon have ranaway\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, every time a player catches a new monster,\r\nhis monster choice and skill description changes too\r\n\r\nCreate \"ash trainer\" object and create \"battle\" verb for it,\r\nin it, code:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Player summoned \"+player.monster)\r\nmsg (\"\"+player.skill)\r\nmsg (\"Ash summoned margengar\")\r\nmsg (\"Margengar casts slime, it is super effective!\")\r\nSetTimeout (3) {\r\n  playerscore = GetRandomInt(1,player.power*player.sight)\r\n  enemyscore = 10\r\n  if (playerscore>enemyscore) {\r\n    msg (\"You have won the battle\")\r\n    msg (\"You have unlocked a nearby locked exit\")\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    MoveObject (game.pov, room)\r\n    msg (\"The enemy is too strong, you have lost the battle\")\r\n    msg (\"You are sent back to the starting area\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe wait 3 seconds adds in some suspense,\r\nThe playerscore is randomized between 1 to his power times sight,\r\nthis is to cast doubt on his strategy so he might mistake unlucky as being under powered,\r\nmaking the game more challenging in a fun and strategic way\r\n\r\n_____________________________________\r\n\r\n**FAQ: That seems like it, I can't digest anymore**\r\n\r\nWell, not really, this is just the start of your full game,\r\nthe unique factor about this gameplay is the energy system,\r\nbecause the player have 100 energy, he can only travel a limited number of rooms,\r\nhe needs to strategize on how to reach further areas before he runs out of energy\r\n\r\nPossible solutions include shops that sells items\r\n1. Berry - Gains 10 energy\r\n2. Bicycle - 50% chance to lose 1 less energy per script turn\r\n3. Cruise - Teleport to a faraway room\r\n4. Maze - By defeating certain enemy trainers, you can unlock shortcut exit rooms\r\n\r\nAlso, power and sight to determine a battle outcome is quite simplistic,\r\nit will be more fun to add in speed and ultimate as well,\r\nspeed can increase your minimum playerscore,\r\nwhile ultimate can increase your maximum playerscore\r\n\r\nVariations in strategy\r\nIn the beginning, hoarding monsters with high power is great,\r\nbecause the player does not need to travel far and needs to catch more pokemons\r\n\r\nIn mid game, sight monsters are more valuable, because there are more and more elusive monsters,\r\nalso at mid range distance rooms, energy is valuable, players need to spot monsters as fast as possible\r\n\r\nIn end game, speed and ultimate are valuable even though they dun help with discovering or catching monsters,\r\nthey do help with defeating trainers, which unlocks various game elements like secret doors, secret shops and secret npcs,\r\nperhaps even a new town where the player can choose to respawn there instead",
