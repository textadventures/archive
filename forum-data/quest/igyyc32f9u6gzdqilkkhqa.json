It's a door, so it logically has to be visible in both rooms, right?\r\n2.  Must it be a 'closed container' so that it can be opened and closed and be locked?\r\n3.  Unlocking the door and opening it must also unlock (or make visible) an exit?\r\n4.  After unlocking the door, can you 'go e' for example and automatically go through the door or should I handle the open door/close door scripts so it doesn't appear so obviously un-door-like?\r\n\r\nShould I be at all concerned with these dumb doors and locked exits at all?!  \r\n\r\nIt just seems like so much code and situation to consider for simply having a door.",
