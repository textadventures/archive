(what's locally?)\n\nHowever, drawing upon that result to take the player to a different room for a different scene to unfold (or what not), is what's eluding me still. Reviewing your code, I can see that the LCase( command is going to be key her. Without making use of switches whilst reviewing your code, makes things a little odd - especially outside of the application. &amp; your use of &lt;b&gt;/&lt;br&gt; is similarly something I've not encountered in the scripts elsewhere.\n\nMaybe you know how I could link the defined result from my code attached to 3 different scenes?

Reviewing your code, I can see that the LCase( command is going to be key her. Without making use of switches whilst reviewing your code, makes things a little odd - especially outside of the application. &amp; your use of &lt;b&gt;/&lt;br&gt; is similarly something I've not encountered in the scripts elsewhere.<br/><br/>Maybe you know how I could link the defined result from my code attached to 3 different scenes? I keep thinking it's an &quot;if&quot; function of &quot;if LCase(Easy), plonk player in Room3&quot; or something along those lines.<br/><br/><pre><code>      get input {<br/>        switch (LCase(result)) {<br/>          case (&quot;mother&quot;) {<br/>            msg (&quot;\\&quot;Well played, outsider&#46;\\&quot;  For your wit, I shall give you this prize&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He hands you a reward for your witty banter&#46;&quot;)</code></pre><br/><br/>I'm thinking Get input, LCase(result), where the case is &quot;mother&quot;, play message &amp; move object.<br/>Then to use another case, just do a new line with case.<br/><br/>Hard coding (as opposed to using the user-friendly-ish buttons) is a bit more tricky.. because, as coding goes, one missing/wrong placed character messes it all up - - - &amp; all I know is that of a mathematician: close all brackets lol",
