      "EditableText": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm sorry about the lack of response!  There was more stuff to add than I'd realized, and I've been hard at it!\r\n\r\nMy last post was just me talking to myself (and knowing someone would correct me if I was mistaken).  It does not matter if you're making a gamebook or a text adventure now.  I fixed that issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is thoroughly untested.  I don't know if I've mentioned that...\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/phvys9dicuimsspr_m9wyq/audiovideolib\r\n\r\nThe BIG thing is:  The desktop player will not play .mp3 files when using an HTML audio tag (which is what we're doing when we use the functions in this library).  \r\n\r\nSomething about Chromium not including the mp3 format because it is not actually free to use:\r\nhttp://www.chromium.org/audio-video\r\n\r\n...and the desktop version of Quest is running an embedded Chromium browser, so: no mp3 functionality there.  This, I believe, is why Alex added the ```play sound``` script in the first place.  \r\n\r\nSo, I include an ogg file for desktop players, along with the mp3.\r\n\r\n(You can use Audacity or ffmpeg (each are free) for all of your audio creation/conversion needs, by the way.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhy not just use the ogg format, you ask?  Because I'm not sure if that will play on iStuff.  (I have no iStuff, nor do I have a Mac.  So, I can't test that without troubling someone.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\nTo simply play a sound from a local file:\r\n```\r\nPlayAudio (\"announcement.ogg;announcement.mp3\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how I have two, separated by ```;```?  This is because one file is a backup which will play if the browser does not support the other's format.\r\n\r\nIf I had those sounds hosted online, it would be:\r\n```\r\nPlayAudio(\"https://thehost.com/sound.ogg;https://thehost.com/sound.mp3\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```PlayAudio(src)``` just plays a song throughout its entirety, even if you clear the screen or the player goes to a new page in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo play a looped sound, use: ```PlayAudioLooped(src)```.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo stop all sounds, use: ```DestroyAllAudio```.\r\n\r\n---\r\nNOTE:  Quest will not include .ogg files unless you add that format to ```game.publishfileextensions```!!!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/37004788-3d3d573c-2097-11e8-86ae-5fc96634f211.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nActual documentation coming very soon!",

There was more stuff to add than I'd realized, and I've been hard at it!</p>\n<p>My last post was just me talking to myself (and knowing someone would correct me if I was mistaken).  It does not matter if you're making a gamebook or a text adventure now.  I fixed that issue.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is thoroughly untested.  I don't know if I've mentioned that...</p>\n<p>http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/phvys9dicuimsspr_m9wyq/audiovideolib</p>\n<p>The BIG thing is:  The desktop player will not play .mp3 files when using an HTML audio tag (which is what we're doing when we use the functions in this library).</p>\n<p>Something about Chromium not including the mp3 format because it is not actually free to use:<br>\nhttp://www.chromium.org/audio-video</p>\n<p>...and the desktop version of Quest is running an embedded Chromium browser, so: no mp3 functionality there.  This, I believe, is why Alex added the <code>play sound</code> script in the first place.</p>\n<p>So, I include an ogg file for desktop players, along with the mp3.</p>\n<p>(You can use Audacity or ffmpeg (each are free) for all of your audio creation/conversion needs, by the way.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Why not just use the ogg format, you ask?  Because I'm not sure if that will play on iStuff.  (I have no iStuff, nor do I have a Mac.  So, I can't test that without troubling someone.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Anyway...</p>\n<p>To simply play a sound from a local file:</p>\n<pre><code>PlayAudio (\"announcement.ogg;announcement.mp3\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how I have two, separated by <code>;</code>?  This is because one file is a backup which will play if the browser does not support the other's format.</p>\n<p>If I had those sounds hosted online, it would be:</p>\n<pre><code>PlayAudio(\"https://thehost.com/sound.ogg;https://thehost.com/sound.mp3\")\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>PlayAudio(src)</code> just plays a song throughout its entirety, even if you clear the screen or the player goes to a new page in the game.</p>\n<p>To play a looped sound, use: <code>PlayAudioLooped(src)</code>.</p>\n<p>To stop all sounds, use: <code>DestroyAllAudio</code>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>NOTE:  Quest will not include .ogg files unless you add that format to <code>game.publishfileextensions</code>!!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/37004788-3d3d573c-2097-11e8-86ae-5fc96634f211.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Actual documentation coming very soon!</p>\n\n",
