      "EditableText": "If i may add my two cents... Gamebook version of Quest is a somewhat second hand product. There is less attention to it because the community uses much more the parser adventure mode than gamebook mode. A wise way of solving most of your problems when creating a gamebook that needs some of the parser resources is making a gamebook inside the adventure mode. The method i have been working on is using objects as the gamebook choices. I decided doing it because objects has the \"look at\" option, allowing me to expand the explanation of a given choice without the actual need of adding a wall of text to the main text. A personal need of mine, because i already use wall of texts in the main descriptions. If you use this resource, it is easy to \"pause\" the gamebook mechanics to insert a turn based combat resolution.",
