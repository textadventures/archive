I think the code is a little harder to understand this way, but it's smaller and will work with all list types. If you're doing this quite often, it might be easier to put this script in a function named something like `ShuffleList` with a single parameter, `list`:\r\n```\r\nfor (i, ListCount (list)-1, 1, -1) {\r\n  item = ListItem (list, GetRandomInt (0, i))\r\n  list remove (list, item)\r\n  list add (list, item)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen you can just do `ShuffleList (some_list_variable)` to shuffle the members of a list (this is an in-place operation - it changes the order of the members of a list, rather than returning a new list).",
