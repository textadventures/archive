Like if the player is taking an item and if i wanted to have 10 preset versions of that item and wanted the program to give the player a random one of those 10 items? Just a thought. I didn't think there was any way to do it that i saw but you are the master.",

After the 'Select Case:' you could type '$rand(1; 10)$' (or click the function button and choose the rand function, from then on, change the lowest and highest number to 1 and 10).\n\nAfter that, add cases. Click Add, and type on the case '1'. Press Ok. The script editor will pop-up, and from there you could add a message and add another script that gives one of the object's preset to the player. Click Ok.\n\nAdd more cases, typing '2', then '3', then '4', and continuing on until you finish the highest number, 10.\n\nI hope that works. ^_^",
