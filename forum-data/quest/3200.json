      "EditableText": "I keep running into this problem... In my game, I have a series of objects which I am using as spells. I have a command which allows the player to cast a spell given that spell object is contained within a hidden object, the player's spellbook. My problem is, when a player learns a new spell, the original spell object is cloned and moved to their spellbook. Say we're using a spell named &quot;blind&quot;. This changes the object's name to &quot;blind1&quot; as it is a duplicate of an already existing object. There are other parts of the game where that object has already been cloned, so now the object's name is &quot;blind2&quot; or &quot;blind3&quot;. So I can't have the game check for a specific name. I need a way for the game to check the spell book for the object's alias instead, which is &quot;Blind&quot;. Is there a way to do this? \n\nAnother similar note, I am working with another script which would end the game when the player's health reaches 0, but not if the player is carrying a specific item in their inventory. I am calling this item &quot;phoenix&quot; right now, if the player's health reaches 0 and the object &quot;phoenix&quot; is in their inventory, then it restores their health and the game does not end. I tried this with a &quot;for each&quot; script, which checks the player's inventory. I hit the same problem with the first, It can only search for the specific &quot;phoenix&quot; object rather than a clone, say &quot;phoenix1&quot; or &quot;phoenix2&quot;. And if the player is carrying more objects in their inventory than just the &quot;phoenix&quot; then it runs the script on them as well, because they are not &quot;phoenix&quot; and ends the game. How can I fix it so that it searches for the alias &quot;Phoenix&quot; and only ends the game if the player lacks it?\n\n[code:12zq8pku]if (player&#46;health &lt;= 0) {\n          if (Got(phoenix)) {\n            msg (&quot;You nearly succumb to your wounds&#46;&#46;&#46; But before your vision fades for the last time, you feel a burning heat radiating from your pouch&#46; A powerful energy washes over you as the Phoenix Phylactory you were carrying uses its magic to restore your life!
