Only suggest of course, I can't very well expect the programmer to drop everything he's doing and obey all my wishes.\n\nAlso note that these wishes are written from the perspective of a (very) casual programmer / author, and not hardcore in either of the two.\n\n\n[size=150:1y188gdg][b:1y188gdg]Simpler connection between the non-coding editor and script commands[/b:1y188gdg][/size:1y188gdg]\n\nI think that Alex talked about this when announcing Quest 5.0. I don't know any specifics, so I'll throw this in anyway.\n\nOne of the main problems I have with Quest right now, is that if I am to specify something a bit more advanced than the built-in easily-accessible functions that don't need coding, I have to go into the ASL file and edit everything from there. For an author point of view, this is fairly tedious, at some points completely unfathomable.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is a &quot;Execute script&quot; function, much like the &quot;other script function&quot; but that handles multiple lines of code, so I don't need to scout through the entire ASL file to find the proper object or room, and then put in the right code in the right spot... to be honest, I'm not really that good a programmer, but I'm good enough to handle smaller bits and pieces of code <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->.\n\n[b:1y188gdg]Pros[/b:1y188gdg]\nMakes it easier for non-programmers to acheive more advanced functions and coding options\n\n[b:1y188gdg]Cons[/b:1y188gdg]\nNone that I can think of for the author him/herself, but it's quite possibly quite a bit of work for Alex.\n\n[size=150:1y188gdg][b:1y188gdg]Objectifying of Music/sounds[/b:1y188gdg][/size:1y188gdg]\nI suggest making sound files an object, much like &quot;objects&quot; or &quot;rooms&quot;. This would allow potentially more methods and functions to control music in a game.\nWhy? Well, considering that Quest is aiming to modernize the 80's text adventure game, a better control on the music could be excellent in several ways:\n\n[*]Several pieces of music/sounds playing simultaneously. For example if you want background music with your game at the same time as you're adding sound effects like doors, creaking or even full speech.\n\n[*]Easier control-functions. An object name could be defined for the music. Let's say that have a certain area in my game consisting of a few-four rooms. All the while the player are in these rooms, a certain piece would be playing. Let's say I add this said piece and called it &quot;scarymusic&quot;. With the name I could then check if the certain music was playing in every of these rooms, and if it wasn't, it could start. \n\n[*]Possibility for simple effects. I'm thinking very simple things like fading in and out music and the likes.\n\n[b:1y188gdg]Pros:[/b:1y188gdg] Gives games a much more multimedia and accessible feed. Adds more layers of emotion into a game\n[b:1y188gdg]Cons [/b:1y188gdg]Again none for the authors, but probably a chore to program into the engine.\n\n\nOk. That's the things I can think of so far. I might add more things as they come up in my mind. I hope for feedback from everyone, and by all means, if you think I have a proper nerve to come here and suggest things like a besserwisser, feel free to say that too:)",
