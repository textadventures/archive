(easier said than done/found, lol. But generally it's easy to fix up bad code, just once you find the bad code parts, lol).\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nyou've got a simple coding mistake (very common to mess up code), one of your 'AddToInventory' Functions doesn't have an input (an Object, as the 'AddToInventory' Function moves an Object into the 'pov: currently controlled', which is generally the default 'player' Player Object) to use for its scripting.\r\n\r\nif you're using the web/online version, you've got to download your 'xxx.quest' published/uploaded game onto your computer, unzip it (to get at the actual 'xxx.aslx' quest files), and then right click on your 'xxx.aslx' game file and open it up via a text editor software (notepad, wordpad, notepad++, apple: text editor, etc), then you've got to find an 'AddToInventory' Function in your entire game code that is missing its input:\r\n\r\nAddToInventory ()\r\n\r\nand you need to change it to having some input (an Object), for an example (pretending you've created/added/have this 'book_1_object' Object in your game already):\r\n\r\nAddToInventory (book_1_object)\r\n\r\nthen save your game file of course.\r\n\r\nas to getting your game back online/web, I've never published, so not sure if you can replace your old game or if you just have to publish your fixed game again, having now two published games, your old unfixed game and your new fixed game.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nif you're using the desktop/offline quest, then it's the same as the above, but you've already got your 'xxx.aslx' quest files on your computer.
