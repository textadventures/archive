Wanted to know if anyone else has done a really hand-holding game section (or full game)?",

It's basically a compilation of little scenarios that are often asked about on the forums and solutions I have come up with to those problems.  In any room you can type 'explain' or 'explain [specific object]' (in some cases) and it will explain how I did that using the downloaded version of the Quest program.  <b>THIS IS NOT HELPFUL</b> for the online version.  Again, this is not super user-friendly and needs an overhaul, but it does address how to do some of the stuff with Quest in a way that <b>I</b> understand it  =)  \r\n\r\nAnd... to navigate, type 'move rooms' and you should get a list of options to choose from.  Navigation is the big overhaul I need to make to this.  Don't say I didn't warn you!  =/\r\n\r\nBest of luck!  I am willing to help with specific scenarios if you are interested.  I could whip up some demo scenarios for each instance you bring to my attention.  If you are so interested pm me and I'll help out!
