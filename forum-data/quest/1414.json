One, a rather lengthy description for when the player first enters the room, or any time thereafter that they request the long version.  Then, a shorter description that will run if the player enters the room again.  Kind of like the 'look at' and 'examine' differences for objects.\n\nThis is for use with v4, if that makes a difference.\n\nThanks!\n\nAlf",
