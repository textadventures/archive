      "EditableText": "Hey folks!\r\n\r\nThis morning, I had an urge to go back and revisit the first text adventure I ever played. Weird to think that my parents bought it from a computer shop, but five years after it was actually release. How many 5yo games do you see in the shops now?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I failed to find any remakes, ports, or online versions. So now I'm playing it on an emulator, which took me more than an hour to get working.\r\nAnd I find that the description for almost every item is \"I see Nothing special\". And I've already found more that a few grammar issues in the game (such as `You ca‘nt do that`, which is starting to drive me nuts.)\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about remaking the game as I play it; a simple project that doesn't require me to think too much. But should I make it as close to the original as possible; or add descriptions to the items that don't have them, fix the grammar, and try to make it a little more polished?\r\n\r\n(I'm seriously going to fix the big guess-the-verb thing at one point, because it's really dumb to have a verb that says \"___ is not in my vocabulary\", except for the one object it can successfully be used on. But would anyone care if I try to make the game a bit more polished? Is anyone interested in remakes of thirty-year-old games anyway?)",

      "EditableText": "Hi mrangel,\r\nThe two main games that I've implemented are remakes from the 1980s. One is also the first game I ever played: _L, A Mathemagical Adventure_, which has a write-up on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_%E2%80%93_A_Mathemagical_Adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen I started, my plan was just to implement the first half, partly as a way to learn Quest, but mostly find out if it was even possible to handle some of the puzzles involved as they involved sound and graphics. The original was implemented in Basic on the BBC Micro. Initially, I thought I would stick as closely as possible to the original but it progressively diverged. Some of this was to meet basic modern expectations. For example, the original didn't implement 'look at' except for a few special cases. I also found I couldn't implement a couple of the puzzles in the same way. There were no grammar problems (it's immaculately written!) but there were a few things I didn't like. For example, the second half of the game felt rushed and incomplete. So, when I started to implement it, I 'improved it'! A few people who played the original, have found the game on textadventures and tried it out, and so far no one  seems bothered by my tweaks.\r\n\r\nI have a lot more I could say, but overall, I found it a very enjoyable and worthwhile experience. Here is the result. Type ABOUT for more information.\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/e4hrqb_vpeo4np1a0jel9g/l-too-another-mathemagical-adventure",
