For example, you could make a turnscript that does:\r\n```\r\nforeach (room, AllRooms()) {\r\n  room.playerhere = Contains (room, game.pov)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd then you could give any room a script attribute named `changedplayerhere` which looks like:\r\n```\r\nif (this.playerhere) {\r\n  // Put code here to run it when the player enters this room\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  // Put code here to run it when the player leaves this room\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis would be a little more flexible in some circumstances. For example, it would even trigger the scripts if the room the player is in moves to a different containing room. (This is probably rare, but I can imagine things like a room representing a caravan or something that an NPC can move, and a script that needs to be triggered when the player enters a new town whether or not the player is actually moving to a different room at the time).",
