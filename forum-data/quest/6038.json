      "EditableText": "Hi All,\n\nOk, this is probably a stupid question... When you create a verb on an object is that supposed to add it to the Verb list? I am trying to create a &quot;push;pull;move&quot; verb and when I try and create it on the object it only shows the first word I put (in this case push) and doesn't add it to the list of verbs on the tree so that I can add extra verbs. If I can't that means I have to add each possibility as a verb themselves and then add the script to each. Then if I want to add the same verb to another object which will work the same way I would have to also add this to the other object manually. This just doesn't seem right...",

Then when you go into your object, you will see that verb in the list (look at the very bottom), and you can use it directly.\n\nThis implicit creation (or not) of verbs when editing an object seems to be a never ending source of problems. It's so much better to just explicitly add the verb up front and have total control over what you're doing! <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
