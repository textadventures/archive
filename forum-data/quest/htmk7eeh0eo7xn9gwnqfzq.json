Testing with JAWS 2019, I saw some accessibility improvements compared to last summer, but couldn't determine whether it was Quest or JAWS which improved. Still, labels do not get associated properly with text fields, the attribute tab acts weird, and code view doesn't work properly, either. (But hey, I can actually play games offline now, which is a HUGE improvement, so it's by no means all bad news).\r\n\r\nI feel like with a bit of effort, I could make the GUI accessible using JAWS scripting. But why make some script if you could change the GUI itself? I Can't guarantee it, but I'm fairly certain I can get some improvements in - I'm both experienced with C#, VS and NVDA + JAWS. Also developed my own applications which included the Tolk library for more accessibility, so I do have some expertise.\r\n\r\nBut I heard Quest is getting a new game creating framework, so before I dive in and start building something which will be deprecated in half a year... Would that be worth it? Or should I wait till the new framework is established and then help making any new desktop application version accessible? Are we going to stick to the current quest application, just with a new framework?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny thoughts and info appreciated!\r\n\r\nPS. If you have questions, I'll be happy to answer them, too.",
