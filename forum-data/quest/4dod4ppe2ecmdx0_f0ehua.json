      "EditableText": "That looks correct to me.\r\n\r\nAre you sure it's in that verb that the error appears?\r\n\r\nNOTE: In the online editor, if you make a typo it will often save without saying anything is wrong. Then when you click on a different object to edit, an error message will pop up. And it'll keep on showing that error message until you refresh the browser, even if the problem is fixed. That's a bug in the online editor.\r\n\r\n1. So, first question: Does the error still appear if you refresh the browser, or if you leave the site and come back?\r\n\r\n2. The code you posted there looks fine. So the editor is probably showing the error in the wrong place. It does that sometimes.\r\nHere's how I go about solving those problems:\r\n   1. Go to the \"My Games\" page\r\n   2. Click \"Download\" for the game with the problem\r\n   3. Open the file in Notepad or vim. If you're not used to dealing with file extensions, the easiest way is to drag the file into a Notepad window.\r\n   4. Use the search/find feature to look for the text from the error message (`ListCount(this`).  It might be in a few different places. Look at all of them, and see if you can see which one has a `(` or `)` missing.\r\n   5.
