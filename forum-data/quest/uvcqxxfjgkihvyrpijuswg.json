      "EditableText": "Translating games is usually pretty difficult unless they were designed for it, because the strings within the game might not be in complete sentences. If you're running the game in a web browser (playing online), some browser extensions may be able to translate it; but some might not work so well with JS-heavy pages.\r\n\r\nThe last time I tried to play a Quest game in another language, I used the Google Translate app on my phone. Its camera mode will let you point the camera at your computer screen and show a live translation of whatever words are there, and running it on a separate device means there can't be any compatibility issues between the game and the translator.\r\n(this also works for online fiction sites like Wattpad, whose copy-protection occasionally causes problems for Google Translate. Pointing my phone's translator at the screen works fine)",
