Most important would be Game ID - hit the 'generate...' button to the right of that field to get a new ID, as if you uploaded a copied game without a new ID it would cause problems.\r\n\r\nThis is what I've done before, anyway. I ended up taking the concepts I liked from my old projects, reworking the ones I didn't, and then constructing a framework with things like my combat system, resources, shops, etc all functioning and working and ready to build off of. A sort of engine-in-an-engine, I guess.",
