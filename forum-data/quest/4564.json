      "EditableText": "Is there a way to replace the pictures instead of clearing the screen and then showing a new picture? Basically what I am aware of, you can add a picture by &quot;show picture&quot; command, but if you don't clear the screen before, the layout you will get is basically this:\n1. Original picture\n2. Some text which you wrote while playing the game\n3. New picture.\n\nWhat I would like is to keep the text you wrote while playing the game, but replace the picture instead of dumping it under the text, because usually the screen centers on a new picture and then you have to scroll before you can get to inputting new commands in the game, and frankly I do not like that solution very much. The problem could be avoided if you could just replace the picture, so that you get this kind of layout:\n1. Original picture that can change to New picture once certain conditions are met\n2. Some text which you wrote while playing the game\n\nFurthermore I am wondering if there is a command for showing ShowRoomDescription elements such as &quot;You can see object X,Y,Z&quot; and &quot;You can go to place A,B,C&quot; without having to necessarily show the whole room description. I just want to be able to call the function part which describes which objects you can see and where you can go. Is that possible? Note that I am aware of ShowRoomDescription, but that function also calls the text you wrote before and that is exactly what I want to avoid.",
