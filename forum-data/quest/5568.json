A response would require these specific keywords. A script would trigger differently for the input, &quot;Ask Bill where the Romans are going.&quot; \n\nI can't imagine this as not feasible. I do not care for out-putting a question to answer a question or showing a menu of topics for the user to pick from.\nI want to research how to pick apart an input from the user and come up with a reasonable response without relying on an exact match scenario. If it is as simple as creating a variable of the input and then using an ...if(var contains whatever) statement then I can probable move ahead easily enough. \n\nI find it difficult to discover lengthy explanations online. It would be to much for you guys to show me and since I am unwilling to take a course in JavaScript, I will rely on the old, &quot;Come to a problem and stop everything your doing and hunt down the answer on Google&quot; approach.
