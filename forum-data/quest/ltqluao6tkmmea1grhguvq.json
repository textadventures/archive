You can't get to the panes to even read them.\r\n\r\nThe [example game I posted](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/oc4uvldffuo98j0yjajavw/scroll-to-top \"Play online or download it here!\") scrolls up and down twice on my Kindle Fire.  After that,it sticks at the bottom, focused on the text input field.  You definitely do have to scroll back up, but nothing really goes haywire in my Kindle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Scrolling to the bottom to focus on the text input field is a feature of Quest.  We would normally _not_ want the player to have to scroll down to enter their command.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### The example game **does** scroll to the top and stick correctly for me on the latest versions of ALL OF THESE BROWSERS:\r\n\r\n- Chrome (desktop and Android)\r\n- Chromium\r\n- Internet Explorer\r\n- Edge, Firefox\r\n- Safari (iPhone6)\r\n- Whatever the default browser in a Samsung Galaxy S6 is called.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is the line of code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSetTimeout (2) {\r\n  JS.eval (\"$('html, body').stop().animate({scrollTop: 0}, 'slow');\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nI have the following Galaxy devices:  S3, S6, Tab2.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't bounce up and down at all on any of these for me.
