I have all that set up fine and good, but when I type the &quot;open&quot; and &quot;close&quot; commands for the book, it says, &quot;You open it,&quot; and then proceeds to print the custom open message I had entered. How can I get it to stop saying &quot;you open it&quot; or &quot;you close it&quot; and just print my message instead?\n\nThanks for any help.",
