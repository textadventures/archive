So far I have to create a completely new object and copy and past my descriptions in each one, while checking or unchecking the appropriate boxes for the desired effects.  It would be far easier and beneficial to simply copy the grass object it self and then paste it where ever I like.\n\nNow whether the game would automatically name it “grass”, “grass1”, “grass2” etc., doesn't matter to me since I can go back and do that on my own, although it would be helpful.  But what I am really after is to simply copy the object and place it in any outdoor room I want, with out the hassle of recreating it from scratch each time.  (Or the same could be said for a vase on a table for an indoor room.)  Is there a way to do that?\n\nI have not gotten far enough in the tutorial to see it if it is there in plain site and for that I appologize.  I know you guys get bogged down with some of the simpliest of questions with equally simple answers that are clearly taught or shown else where... or perhaps I had over looked it, but I have done a search and have not found what I am looking for, although there was a thread for copying duplicates to “another” game.  I just want it in this one game at the moment.  Thank you for your time and patience.",
