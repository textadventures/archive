(or Lamp Power: !) Whatever you want the player to see. \n\nNext, on the same tab,\nLook at &quot;Attributes&quot;\nAdd\noxygen (make it an [i:2yljnh33]integer[/i:2yljnh33]: 0) \n\nAdd\nlamp_power (make it an [i:2yljnh33]integer[/i:2yljnh33]: 0) \n\nThey should display now. Then you can set up variables like when player enters so and so room, or whatever...\n\nSet variable:player.oxygen = player.oxygen + 100\nSet variable:player.lamp_power = player.lamp_power + 100\n\nIf you want them to subtract, there are numerous ways of doing it. \n\nYou could have each room have a script that does this...\n\nIf expression: not player.oxygen = 0 \nthen\nSet variable:player.oxygen = player.oxygen - 1\netc\n\nOR\n\nYou can set up a &quot;Turn Script&quot;\nGame (tree of stuff)\nRight Click\nAdd\nTurn-Script\nName: oxygen_and_lamp_power\nClick the &quot;Enabled when game begins&quot; box\nThen set up the script to - 1 from both per turn. \nBut make sure you set up that if it isn't 0 then subtract (or it'll start going into negative values)\n\nAfter that in the same Turn Script...you can do something like...\nif (player.oxygen &lt; 0) {\n  player.health = 0\nMsg (&quot;&quot;)\nFinish Game\n}\nif (player.lamp_power &lt; 0) {\n  player.health = 0\nMsg (&quot;&quot;)\nFinish Game\n}\n\nOr something like that ^_^\n\nHope I helped!",
