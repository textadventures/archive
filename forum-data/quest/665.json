      "EditableText": "Hello there, Dennis. I've just created a DEMO for you. I know that you wanted a train to pass every 5 turns, so I implemented that, but I wasn't sure what you meant about the NPC. I think you meant that you want it to follow you, but I'm not sure about when, how, what etc. you meant. So I created a character that follows you onto the train when you get on. If you wanted something else, tell me, and I'll fix it. Anyway, the DEMO has that every five turns, the train comes....but you only have a limited time to board it before it leaves again....and in case it does, it comes again in another five turns. After boarding, it takes you to a different location. (And moves the NPC with you.) Anyway, I hope I didn't make any mistakes, because it's 4:30 A.M. here, and I'm drop dead tired. If something doesn't work, just let me know. Hope this helps. \nP.S. (I know I always post this when I post a code, but here goes again...) In case you don't know how to use the posted code, just copy it into a word program, such as wordpad, or notepad, and save as &quot;something.asl&quot; Then just click on that file.
