Quest Text Adventures have a full world model, where objects and rooms relate to each other in a meaningful way, and have numerous features not supported by Game Books. Squiffy has no world model, but is great for creating multiple choice games that focus on text and story, and will produce a game that can be run in any browser, without the need for a dedicated server.

There are options in Quest to make the text input box completely disappear.\r\n\r\nNOTE: To create a game that you can play by clicking links, the author must include each option as a menu item in each object's drop-down menu. You'll also have to remove USE from the objects that you didn't write the USE responses for.\r\n\r\nI would strongly advise creating a small game in Squiffy first.

to walk away from the training ground. it was the older boy that you beat earlier. <br/>\"hold it [name]\" he said as he pulled your shoulder and forced you to face him. you have this urge to punch him in the face so hard but you calm your nerves and let him speak. <br/><br/>\"i hope you dont think that you are better than me just because you beat me in mere swordsplay\" he taunts at you. you noticed the glow in his palm that indicates magical spell is used.<br/><br/>he just as anyone else in this kingdom knows full well about your inability to harness and use magic. and by that fact alone makes you an outcast. the undesireable. the freak. most people shun at you and talks behind your back, but some people... like this older boy, they dont care if you are the prince of the kingdom. they dont care if you are the heir of the throne and that they owe their allegience to you, they just find satisfaction to bully your inability to use magic. but somewhat, somehow you actually respect people like him. he have the guts to confront you and not just talks behind your back and even spread rumors just like most people you know. <br/><br/>\"i dont want any problem... its just practice anyway.\" you replied<br/><br/>he takes a few step back putting some distance between the both of you as he displayed his fire magic to intimidate you.<br/>\"ofcourse... its just practice. but you see... its been a long time since we had magical fight practice and i just want to know how good i am  by sparring you again, with magic this time of course\" he said with mocking tone.<br/><br/>you clench your fist when you heard the word magic.<br/><br/>{command:Page8:says that you are not interested in anymore spar and walks away}<br/><br/>{command:Page8:you turn your back to him and walks

take a sidestep instinctively and feels a warm thing fly across where your head is supposed to be, had you not evade it. a firebolt spell. you grit your teeth and turn around seeing the older boy with a huge grin across his face holding fire in his palm. <br/><br/>you stood there motionless, some 10 meters away from him and glares. a second later, 2 firebolt flies to you which you can easily avoid with just your upper body movement. <br/><br/>\"whats the matter? come on use your magic against me already~\" he said \"but oh... i forgot~ you cant!\" he said again mockingly and with a big laugh <br/><br/>you dont really have any choice except to stand your groud and evade his spell. you know you cant beat a spellcaster in a close combat let alone in this range. you think for a few moment as what to do when suddenly the older guy yelps in pain with surprise, you see a beautiful young lady with a bright scarlet hair behind him with angered looks in her face. <br/><br/>\"go away... NOW\" she glares at the older boy while showing a blue-ish aura around her.<br/><br/>\"s...sorry princess.. right away princess\" he replied and quickly bows and walks backward a few step before turning around and runs<br/><br/>\"nothing is too much huh?\" you grins at her<br/><br/>\"hhhhmph... he deserves that, anyway are you okay [name]?\" she walks towards you with worried looks in her face <br/><br/>\"ive been better, thanks for the help anyway, if only i can do what you did back there\" <br/><br/>\"aww gezzz you are the prince.. you shouldnt look so pathetic\" she hits your head jokingly and grabs you by the arm \"care to lead this princess to the castle?\" she said in spoiled voice<br/><br/>\"thats my arm that you are strangling there\" you tried to push her head away from your arm gently <br/><br/>\"nope... i am the princess and i claim this arm as mine\" she said jokingly <br/><br/>you walk with her towards the castle. unlike you, an adopted heir, she is a princess by blood... a real royalty, flesh and blood of the king himself. she is about the only person in the kingdom -except the king- that doesnt mind about your inability to use magic. in fact she respect you because of it and think very highly of you. <br/>along the way you...<br/><br/>{command:Page9:ask her about magic}<br/><br/>{command:Page10:ask if she remember about the first time we

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;only lands in the southern provice that has never been covered by snow and mostly used for farming industry. because of the lack of snow, this provice produce most of the kingdom's needs of food product including the all important alcoholic bevereges such as wine or mead. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and last is the central provice. where the capital city of magicinda, infinium is located. the central provice are the smallest yet most important province. library, academy of magic, the castle, just about any important things can be found in this province.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;every provice is governed by governor, not handpicked by the king, but is voted by lords and ladies from the province. lords and ladies are the title bestowed by the king for those who have lands to rule and pay tax to the king. a lord or lady can have as little as 10 villages but some can have as many as 50 villages even cities and castles. they have certain sovereignty over their land but answer to the king and his extension the governor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~the capital city... infinium~&lt;br/&gt;lies a courtyard of a soldier training barrack near the castle. and there you stand... a 14 year old boy... almost a man,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{command:name:what is your name?}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;]]&gt;&lt;/description&gt;\n    &lt;options

afternoon~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;someone grab you by your shoulder just when you are about to walk away from the training ground. it was the older boy that you beat earlier. &lt;br/&gt;\"hold it [name]\" he said as he pulled your shoulder and forced you to face him. you have this urge to punch him in the face so hard but you calm your nerves and let him speak. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"i hope you dont think that you are better than me just because you beat me in mere swordsplay\" he taunts at you. you noticed the glow in his palm that indicates magical spell is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he just as anyone else in this kingdom knows full well about your inability to harness and use magic. and by that fact alone makes you an outcast. the undesireable. the freak. most people shun at you and talks behind your back, but some people... like this older boy, they dont care if you are the prince of the kingdom. they dont care if you are the heir of the throne and that they owe their allegience to you, they just find satisfaction to bully your inability to use magic. but somewhat, somehow you actually respect people like him. he have the guts to confront you and not just talks behind your back and even spread rumors just like most people you know. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"i dont want any problem... its just practice anyway.\" you replied&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he takes a few step back putting some distance between the both of you as he displayed his fire magic to intimidate you.&lt;br/&gt;\"ofcourse... its just practice. but you see... its been a long time since we had magical fight practice and i just want to know how good i am  by sparring you again, with magic this time of course\" he said with mocking tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you clench your fist when you heard the word magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{command:Page8:says that you are not interested in anymore spar and walks away}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{command:Page8:you turn your back to him and walks away without saying a word}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;]]&gt;&lt;/description&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;object

is supposed to be, had you not evade it. a firebolt spell. you grit your teeth and turn around seeing the older boy with a huge grin across his face holding fire in his palm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you stood there motionless, some 10 meters away from him and glares. a second later, 2 firebolt flies to you which you can easily avoid with just your upper body movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"whats the matter? come on use your magic against me already~\" he said \"but oh... i forgot~ you cant!\" he said again mockingly and with a big laugh &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you dont really have any choice except to stand your groud and evade his spell. you know you cant beat a spellcaster in a close combat let alone in this range. you think for a few moment as what to do when suddenly the older guy yelps in pain with surprise, you see a beautiful young lady with a bright scarlet hair behind him with angered looks in her face. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"go away... NOW\" she glares at the older boy while showing a blue-ish aura around her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"s...sorry princess.. right away princess\" he replied and quickly bows and walks backward a few step before turning around and runs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"nothing is too much huh?\" you grins at her&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"hhhhmph... he deserves that, anyway are you okay [name]?\" she walks towards you with worried looks in her face &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"ive been better, thanks for the help anyway, if only i can do what you did back there\" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"aww gezzz you are the prince.. you shouldnt look so pathetic\" she hits your head jokingly and grabs you by the arm \"care to lead this princess to the castle?\" she said in spoiled voice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"thats my arm that you are strangling there\" you tried to push her head away from your arm gently &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\"nope... i am the princess and i claim this arm as mine\" she said jokingly &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you walk with her towards the castle. unlike you, an adopted heir, she is a princess by blood... a real royalty, flesh and blood of the king himself. she is about the only person in the kingdom -except the king- that doesnt mind about your inability to use magic. in fact she respect you because of it and think very highly of you. &lt;br/&gt;along the way

I deleted the first line because there would be no way the game can print the player's name before the player has entered it. (Also, the link at the bottom now reads: 'Enter your name and continue...', but, by looking at your code so far, I can tell you know how to change that if you'd like to.)\r\n2. I added a page I labeled 'getname', which is just the script to collect the name. Once the name is entered, the player is taken to Page2.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: If you want to print the name the player entered at any time (except for on Page1) you can now use <code>{player.alias}</code>.**\r\n\r\n---\r\nI basically just added the page called 'getname' and linked Page1 to it. \r\n\r\nThis is the script that collects the player's name then moves them to Page2: \r\n<code>  msg (\"What is your name?\")\r\n      GetInput() {\r\n        player.alias = result\r\n        MovePlayer (Page2)\r\n      }</code>\r\n\r\nNow, anytime you put ```{player.alias}``` anywhere in text, it will print the name which was entered by the player.\r\n\r\nHere's the altered code:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click here to view code</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--Saved by

from heating a bath tub, to fighting a battle. magic is a day to day life for the people lives here.&lt;br/&gt;snow covers most of the land all year long in most part and the kingdom itself is divided into 5 provice.&lt;br/&gt;the northern provice with the coldest athmosphere. there is not much things here except a huge old stone tower that stands some 300m tall. the details regarding the tower has always been a mystery for the general population.&lt;br/&gt;the western province consist of thick forrest and rivers... which ofcourse frozen during winter. this provice are the main producer of wood and pelts. the thick forrest offers plenty of games to hunt and the river have lots of great fishing spot.&lt;br/&gt;the eastern provice are full of mountains and hills... people dig deeper into the mountain everyday in search of mineral such as iron and bronze and even precious gems like ruby or saphire.&lt;br/&gt;only lands in the southern provice that has never been covered by snow and mostly used for farming industry. because of the lack of snow, this provice produce most of the kingdom's needs of food product including the all important alcoholic bevereges such as wine or mead.&lt;br/&gt;and last is the central provice. where the capital city of magicinda, infinium is located. the central provice are the smallest yet most important province. library, academy of magic, the castle, just about any important things can be found in this province.&lt;br/&gt;every provice is governed by governor, not handpicked by the king, but is voted by lords and ladies from the province. lords and ladies are the title bestowed by the king for those who have lands to rule and pay tax to the king. a lord or lady can have as little as 10 villages but some can have as many as 50 villages even cities and castles. they have certain sovereignty over their land but answer to the king and his extension the governor.&lt;br/&gt;~the capital city... infinium~&lt;br/&gt;lies a
