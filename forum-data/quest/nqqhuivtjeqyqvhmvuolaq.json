You can add the .js file to your game by going to Advanced -> Javascript.\r\n<code>\r\n        document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e){\r\n\r\n\tvar exit_dir = \"None\"\r\n\t\r\n\tif (e.keyCode = 37) {\r\n\t\texit_dir = \"west\"\r\n\t}\r\n\telse if (e.keyCode = 39) {\r\n\t\texit_dir = \"east\"\r\n\t}\r\n\telse if (e.keyCode = 38) {\r\n\t\texit_dir = \"north\"\r\n\t}\r\n\telse if (e.keyCode = 40) {\r\n\t\texit_dir = \"south\"\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tif (exit_dir != \"None\") {\r\n\t\tASLEvent('MoveCallback', exit_dir);\r\n\t}\r\n})\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n2. Create the MoveCallback function. Give it a single parameters 's' and add the following code.\r\n<code>\r\nexit_dir = s\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n3. You'll need to add more code to MoveCallback but that's dependent on how you got your game set up so I'll list the basic steps.\r\n\r\n3a. Get all the exits that lead from the current room and that go in the same direction as exit_dir.\r\n\r\n3b. If there's only 1 exit, you can just move the player. If there's multiple, you can have them choose from a list first and then move them.\r\n\r\nI tested this using the same project that I used for the tutorial. There's only one exit going in a given direction at a time and the exits are named so that I can easily access them.
