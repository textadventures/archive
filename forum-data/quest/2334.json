Your best chances at preventing this are having your looping point occurring at the centre crossing line of the audio's waveform, with the ending point and the beginning points of the waveforms being as close to the same direction to each other as possible.\nYou can try to redraw the beginning and ending waveforms at maximum zoom in an audio editor.  If the angles of the waveform's lines are altered though, you'll be changing the amplitudes of the related harmonics, at that point which again, can result in a 'click'/'thump' in the resulting audio.\n\nAnother method could be to crossfade the loop points.  (Mix in a gradual fadeout of the end of the sample, with a gradual fade in of the beginning of the sample.  These can work quite well at times depending on what your actual audio source is.  If it's music or speech, this could be something of a problem.  If it's background audio - forest; wind; waves; etc., you'd have a greater chance of success.)\n\nRich",
