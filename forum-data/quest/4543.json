There you can set the order of how automatic room descriptions are displayed. If you don't want exits displayed simply set the number next to where it says 'exit list' to zero. This will do it for the entire game though not just an individual room. \n\nOnce the exit is created, click on the room in the left panel, click 'exits' in the main window and then click 'edit' in the right panel. In the main window there will now be a check box you can tick that says 'locked'.\n\nHope that answers your question.",
