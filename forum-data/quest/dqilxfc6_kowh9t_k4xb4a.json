I'm brand new to the Quest scene, and I've been working on an interactive fiction story in Gamebook set during the French Revolution (Heavily based on narrative so that's why I'm using gamebook).  I'm having a _really_ hard time trying to implement consequences to the player character's decisions and have the NPCs reflect on the dialogue choices made by the character.\r\n\r\n The game I have in mind has multiple different endings and depending on the player's dialogue choices, the NPCs will either react positively or negatively. I could go about this by typing page after page, but is there any non-cumbersome way of going about this? \r\nThe problem is, is that I've found so much information on Quest Documentation pages about coding within Gamebook, but I have absolutely no idea where to start.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd go into more detail if I could, but I'm _very_ inexperienced when it comes to this so I'm sorry if I am way too vague. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
