      "EditableText": "Hello again.  Taking a small break from my main Text Game and wanted to fiddle with the Game Book and now I am fully engulfed in a first chapter with a few more chapters in my head.  (It is taking longer than it would to normally write a chapter, because of all the side missions and possible endings...)  But I am running into a few problems.  Before I even post the file, I was just wondering if there are any &quot;known&quot; work arounds or fixes and or a work in progress to fix or change some things.\n\nFirst, I have about 35 pages and will most likely be a little over 40, before the first chapter is done and I will publish it.  But I find it becoming extremely hard to remember what page goes to the next etc.  I write in tangents and maybe that is my problem, but in a game like this with multiple choices, I have to.  Is there a way to incorporate a &quot;tech tree&quot; of sorts or lines connecting pages on the tree so I know what goes where?  As of right now I have to click on each individual page to see and then back track to the following page and so on till I get to the right one.\n\nAlso I some how moved my Page 4 to a different page.  I found it easily enough, but I could not take it out of that page.  If I did I just put it in another page.  I am not sure if that actually affects anything or not, but I could not get it out from hiding no matter where I clicked.  Even putting it to &quot;Game&quot; just hides it to the &quot;Game&quot; folder.  So I deleted it and then remade Page 4 and now...\n\nWe now come to my serious problem.  I remade it.  I go to the following pages and it says it is linked to such and such a page.  Yet when I run the game it acts as if I typed out the page in plain text, as in no clickable blue link, and it says &quot;(broken link)&quot;.  Yet the page is clearly showing it was made again, but it is all the way down to the bottom between Pages 34 and 35.  Does it being so far down make a difference?  How come the page did not &quot;recenter&quot; or &quot;recalibrate&quot; itself to be between Pages 3 and 5?  Am I suppose to now skip Page 4 and then just go to next page in line like 38 and link the old links to it or is it going to be a cascading problem from now on?\n\nOr is the problem simply that I am redirecting one page to go to an existing page and one page can not hold more than one &quot;incoming&quot; line for game traffic so to speak?  (I wanted to save time and pages so I did some redirects that make sense.) It is late and maybe I just need to mess around with it some more, but with all these pages it is confusing me and worse yet my later chapters will be at least twice as long.\n\nAlso, that I can remember anyway, some pages are longer than others and actually need to be scrolled down.  But when you get to the page, or at least begin the game which is the first page.  (I have to give the player some back ground info.) it immediately scrolls for them to the bottom where the links to the other pages are.  But I want them to have to scroll down manually so they actually read the first part with out have to scroll back up to read it.\n\nFinally, is there a way to add sound waves?  Just simple few second bursts of sounds?  Thank you.",
