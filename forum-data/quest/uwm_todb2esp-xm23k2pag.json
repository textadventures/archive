I like playing games on here and I was even planning on using Quest online to make one, but one thing I've noticed with a lot of Quest games specifically is that when I'm afk at some point it times out, and then there's no way for me to resume. I can't figure out how to load a game. Whenever I save, it says I've saved successfully, but load, resume, open... nothing seems to work. I refresh the page like it says. I read some page on a Google result saying that when someone refreshes it, there's an option to resume the game but that doesn't happen for me.\r\n\r\nI'm not playing in an incognito window.\r\n\r\nSorry about asking a playing question on here, I tried Googling it and finding some place on the site about Quest playing help, but couldn't find anything.",
