I chance upon Quest and these forum just the other day, and have taken a very brief look into this apparently very cool software.\n\nI've spent a bit of time browsing the forums to get my bearing a little bit.  I see that there are some very knowledgable authors that actually share their knowledge and experience with the masses (Thank you.)  I also see that the forums are 'alive' (current posts) and this gives me hope.  How many times have I found an old adventure game utility that is dead and the support a mear fading ghost of better times?  But not so here it seems.  Cheers!\n\nSo I'll try not to seem too silly.  (too late?) Bear with me, however, as I ask the first of what will hopefully turn out to be a short list of noobish type questions:\n\n\nI've started tinkering around with rooms and objects and quickly came to the conclussion that I needed containers!  A glancing through the forums and I find a link or two.  Then I go out to the Quest folder itself and find a promising pdf file and some other files related to TypeLib.qlb.  Yay! I think to myself.  I'll just follow the simple instructions and add the library via the Games menu.\n\nAlas, the download of Quest that I grabbed from the axesoftware site does not seem to actually include the TypeLib.glb library file itself!  Help!  Point me to a link, or MaDbRIT, if you see this, please email it to me at:  <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:mhenry00@comcast.net\">mhenry00@comcast.net</a><!-- e -->.  I'd really like to get that library incorporated in early on so that I can learn it as I work my way through the learning curve on the Quest/QDK system overall.\n\n\nMuch thanks in advance.",
