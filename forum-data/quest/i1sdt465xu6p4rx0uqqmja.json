Trouble is, I can't even get the thing to respond to a simple question with a printed message. I have made sure that the ask/tell function is switched on in the game features. I have followed the example in the tutorial with the Bob NPC as closely as possible but when I ask the device anything I get the response \"I don't recognize that command.\" I've tried finding help online and on the other tutorial page about Ask/Tell. When I try to just make a new ask command it tells me that that command is already in the game. I'm really stumped on how to get it to work. The example seemed so simple? All other aspects of the tutorial and building the game have gone smoothly so I'm really bummed about this. I have 0 coding experience like I said so if you suggest a solution involving the code view please be patient with me as I try and figure it out. I am using the Desktop version of Quest. Is there any other information I can give to indicate what the problem is? If this is unclear please let me know.",
