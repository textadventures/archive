For instance, what if I wanted Beer Bottles as a health meter and they would be slowly taken away or broken or removed entirely one by one until nothing was left or a guy's face that would get rougher looking with blood and bruises?  (Like from the DOOM series of games.)  I am not saying it has to be super fancy with awesome graphics, but just something so you know they are beer bottles and they are breaking, thus your health is diminishing.  As with everything else I am code intolerant so if any one knows how and is kind enough to share it, can you explain it where someone that knows nothing of code can understand it?  Thank you.",

Pertex mentioned I could possibly use my own Status Attributes.  Would it show up on the Health Screen it self?  And if so, would there be a way to &quot;hide&quot; the original health system while still using it?  In other words, I want health in my game, not so much this current game, (I'll explain later...) but for future ones.  So the health system will have to function properly and the [X] [X] [X] [ ] [ ] would have to function as the health it self.  Since I can not change the way health looks, is there a way to fool the game into producing the desired effect I want regardless.  Health is still there, but you can not &quot;see&quot; the 100%, 85%, 22% etc. (As in invisible, but still functioning in the background.) Only [X] [X] [X] [ ] [ ] could be seen?  And for the Status Attributes can I download pics and or create them myself?  Like if I wanted to make a &quot;horizontal health bar&quot; system.  I would just draw lines ------------, -------, --  etc?  (Real lines, not those.  Mine would be colored and drawn using a ruler.   <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif\" alt=\":mrgreen:\" title=\"Mr. Green\" /><!-- s:mrgreen: -->   )",
