In one case I pasted three lines of code to a second object, but almost always, even when pasting a single message of three sentences, I get an error message, and my game page resets itself, sending my cursor back to game. Would I have better luck transferring code within an offline engine, instead of working online. Alternatively, is there something I can do to make it work online, or offline, more well?",
