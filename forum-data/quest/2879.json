It's a cutscene for my game in which a picture of the main character is shown, the image flashes to some still shots of flashbacks. There is a low drone in the background and with each flash there is a deep, bass &quot;WHUMMM&quot; to show the character feeling these flashbacks hitting him quite hard.\n\nHowever, I noticed there wasn't an area to put movies! I suppose I was so surprised at all the things the program could do, I assumed too much. That was my bad.\n\nSo what should I do instead? I could start an animated GIF and an MP3 at the same time, but timing the gif with the MP3 would be really difficult to do, and it wouldn't be a constant.\n\nAlso, if it's a possibility at all, the easiest solution would be a way to have Quest just play the WMV, I'm just assuming that isn't possible, however.",
