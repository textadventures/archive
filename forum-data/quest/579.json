      "EditableText": "Right, it hasn't reached version 1.0 yet, mainly because there's 2 functions to add... the $CML_round(n1)$ function, and the rest of the $CML_decimal( P/S/M;n1;n2 [;nx;nx+1...] )$ function.\n\nBut I am releasing this to the public to make sure there aren't any bugs that I've missed so far.\n\nThere's the decimal function: $CML_decimal( D;n1;n2 )$ which returns a decimal string of a number devided by another number.\nWe also have these functions:\n$CML_add(n1;n2[;nx;nx+1...])$ (adds numbers together... for example: set numeric &lt;result; $CML_add(1;2;3;4;5)$ &gt; ... Result = 15 )\n$CML_sub(n1;n2 [;nx;nx+1...])$ (subtracts subsequent numbers from the first... EG. set numeric &lt;result; $CML_sub(30;1;2;3;4)$ &gt; ... Result = 20 )\n$CML_mult(n1;n2 [;nx;nx+1...])$ (multiplies numbers together... EG. set numeric &lt;result; $CML_mult(1;2;3;4;5)$ &gt;... Result = 120 )\n$CML_div(n1;n2)$ (devides n1 by n2... ONLY n1 and n2!)\n\nHope people can use this, and also suggest other functions for maths.\nI have done this mainly because I don't like only two calculation in quest right now... So now you can do this:\nset numeric &lt;$CML_add(3;5;2)$ * $CML_div(50;2)$ &gt;\nwhich is 3 different actions, but also 5 seperate set's in one.\n\nOnce again, suggestions are welcome here.\nI'm thinking about the following myself right now:\n$CML_equ([i:2de2pyif]#function#[/i:2de2pyif];n1;n2 [;nx [[i:2de2pyif]functionx[/i:2de2pyif];[[i:2de2pyif]functiony[/i:2de2pyif]];m1;mx]])$ so you could in fact have this:\n$CML_equ(P;3;5;2;M;D;50;2)$ to do the stuff above in one call... also:\n$CML_equ(P;1;2;M;3;P;S;50;25)$ would result is (3*3)+(50-25) = 31\nI shall have to think it over some though... Your thoughts are welcome (again)...\n\n::EDIT::\nForgot the link:\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.compwhizz.freeserve.co.uk/cmathlib.zip\">http://www.compwhizz.freeserve.co.uk/cmathlib.zip</a><!-- m -->",
