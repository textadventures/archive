      "EditableText": "When a player picks something up, the volume of that item is added to what?\nI made the volume of a piece of driftwood = 6 under the inventory tab for a (piece of driftwood). When I pick up the drift wood, where is the volume of 6 stored in the players attributes.\n\nI am trying to script when the player wants to climb a tree that if he has anything in inventory (carrying in hands and not stored in a pouch) that his attempt will fail, with an explanation as to why. I figured the player would have some sort of current inventory volume attribute. So what do I check to see if player is carrying anything?\nI guess I could check the currentobjectlist attribute on the player, but my feeble coding skills lack the necessary level. I want to use the default (take) script so I don't have to make my own player attribute and add to it every time I pick something up....Holy crap, I just thought of something. This sounds like a function being used here. Hold on and I'll check... Ok, (Command &quot;take&quot; + function &quot;DoTake&quot;) = (Forgewright + confused). I understood some of it but it left me in the fetal position.\n\n\nThe player has a volume attribute, but this does not increase when the drift wood is picked up.  \nAny ideas?",

In this case, the attribute is used in the GET command, which you can find if you do Filter  - Show Library Elements. In fact the command is called TAKE, and in turn uses DoTake. Looking at the code, turns out the volume is calculated each time, using this code:\n[code:24moamed]  volume = 0\n  foreach (obj, GetAllChildObjects(game&#46;pov)) {\n    if (HasInt(obj, &quot;volume&quot;)) {\n      volume = volume + obj&#46;volume\n    }\n  }[/code:24moamed]",
