A small tutorial/demo/template I was working on turned into a little game all on its own.\n\nI converted it to a .quest file and I got a warning message that it may be too large to upload.\n\nI tried to upload it anyway... after several minutes of &quot;spinning wheels&quot; I got the following error message:\n&quot;The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.&quot;\n\nAt 48707KB, it isn't too large is it?  It's large because of the sounds I added, I'm sure, but that's part of the fun I had making the game.  The sounds I used are .wav files and I realize those are the larger ones, but is it possible to upload without converting them all to .mp3 (or other format)?  Any suggestions?  \n\nEDIT:  I converted two large .wav files (totaling 46.9MB) into .mp3 files (totaling 6.94MB)... My new .quest file is now 6.94MB greater than what it was before (~55MB) so I assume those two .wav files are still lingering around somewhere in my .aslx file.  Where the hell are they so I can get rid of them? \n\nAlso, I tried uploading the second save game and got the following error message:\n&quot; Runtime Error\nDescription: An application error occurred on the server.
