      "EditableText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm at the end of writing a game where lying down on your bed causes the session to end. I've given warning about this to the player prior, but I also want them to be able to select &quot;yes/no&quot; when asked &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I've got everything else working but I can't seem to figure this out.\n\nI'm using Quest online on my Mac, and tried &quot;run script &gt; ask question &gt; Are you sure you would like to lie down?&quot; This throws up the options 1. Yes 2. No. So far, so good.\n\nBut I can't get it to work after this point. I tried &quot;if expression: 1&quot;, &quot;if expression: yes&quot;, etc., but it kept giving me an Int32 error. Clicking the hyperlinks in-game caused the same problem. I checked the Quest documentation and it said to use &quot;if expression: true&quot;. When I tried that, the error message disappeared, but regardless of whether the player clicked 1 or 2, it gave the same response.\n\nSo, to clarify: I want &quot;Are you sure?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Game over&quot;/ &quot;Are you sure?&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;Undo turn&quot;. What I have is this:\n\n[b:24nymepo]Ask (&quot;Are you sure you would like to lie down? You are sure to fall asleep; and by the atmosphere of a lucid dream about this place, there is no guarantee you'll ever find it again.&quot;) {\n  if (true) {\n    finish\n    msg (&quot;You fall asleep.&quot;)\n  }\n  else if (false) {\n    undo\n  }\n}[/b:24nymepo]\n\nAnd it will not differentiate between responses. It ends the game regardless to yes or no, or it undoes a turn regardless of yes or no, depending on whether I open with &quot;if: true&quot; or &quot;if: false&quot;.\n\nHow do I get the game to recognise whether the player answers yes or no, instead of ignoring their input entirely or throwing up an error? I used another yes/no question earlier in the game and I'm having the same problem.\n\nThank you very much in advance. Sorry if this doesn't make much sense; I'm writing while at the end of my tether! I'm ready for beta apart from this one issue...\n\nEdit: Also, I'm very new to this, so apologies if this is a silly question.\nEdit 2: I'm happy to discuss workarounds for this, but if it would be better in IF Answers that's fine. I should also clarify I've tried simply &quot;else&quot; as well as &quot;else if (false)&quot;. Just not sure why the else keeps getting overridden.",
