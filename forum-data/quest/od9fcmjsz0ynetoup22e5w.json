NpcLib has just one area for a  \"script\" for each NPC, so that once it is filled you can write \"script\" in the NPCs list of actions which it follows in a loop, one action per turn, as many times as you like. After that, you can add verbs and commands and things.\r\nI think it looks like it should work well.",
