Now save game, then load game. Guess what? The door's closed. [edited] had thought it made IsOpen=0 again, not 1, but it's the newly created room exit itself not being saved.\n\nAnother thing it's not saving is when that door object creats a new room exit. The save game loaded back up again loads the game's default state for all room exits (i.e. if the game starts with a door closed and the player opens it and that creates an exit north that wasn't there before, doing save, then load doesn't seem to save that new northward exit. So what winds up happening is the player has to close the door and re-open it again to re-create the exit). \n\n[edited]\nMy bad... it IS saving the object property of IsOpen=1... it's not, however, saving the new room exit(s) state.\n\nBy the way, what does the save game feature actually save? The global variables? If so I might rework my code so it stores object properties as a global variable instead. \n\nAlso, some who have been testing my beta game are finding the game crash on saves and loads, but say this is common with other quest games as well. If you don't save or load the crash doesn't happen. Only on save or load. (I'm using global arrays to some degree... maybe that is causing the crash because of the brackets?)\n\nWhat might be a nice feature is to have the option of running an additional script after the player loads a game. Just an idea. Sort of like have an \"on load saved game\" script. That way (like in my door object bug) I could write a work-around script once (i.e. a for loop to go through all the rooms and make sure doors are open or closed and the exits are created or erased). Could also use this type of script area to keep track of how many times the player is restoring a game, or have some narration remind the player where the game left off.",
