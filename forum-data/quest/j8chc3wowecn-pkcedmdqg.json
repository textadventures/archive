I was about to put it into code, but then realized I didn't know how to. \r\n\r\nIn my case, the player will pick a stereotype they can set for themselves. What I did first was show menu and put the result into player.type. Then, the player has these attributes called strength, beauty, intelligence, etc. The stereotype the player picks will determine what the value each of these attributes have.\r\n\r\nI use the online version, by the way.",
