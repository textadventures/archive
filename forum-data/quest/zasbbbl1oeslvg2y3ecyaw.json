      "EditableText": "Hi everyone.  I am attempting to learn Quest 5 as it seems to have all the tools I want to implement in my very own text-based RPG.  My approach to learning Quest 5 is that I am going through all of the links on the main Quest 5 Documentation page starting with the tutorial section.  I am only a few pages in on the tutorial, but I have a question:\r\n\r\nI was drawn to Quest 5 because it requires no coding.  I really do not have any experience with building scripts yet, but it seemed to me like you could build scripts in the GUI/IDE by pointing and clicking.  However, when I read through some of the forums and I guess non-official tutorials many people suggest not even using the GUI/IDE and just writing your own code in Notepad++ (or something similar).  Is this a common approach to Quest 5?  Do many of the advanced users simply bypass the GUI/IDE and write code directly?  Will I limit myself in anyway if I choose to solely build my game through the GUI/IDE?\r\n\r\nBonus question - This one is really a waste of time to ask, but there are no dumb questions, right, right??  Can Quest 5 be used for a multiplayer text adventure (aka MUD)?  I am pretty sure this is a flat out no, but is there any background on multiplayer games and Quest 5?  Was there ever an attempt to add this to Quest, or does Quest 5 support another tool/library to implement multiplayer?",
