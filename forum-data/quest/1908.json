      "EditableText": "ok, the built in feature for helping to do stuff when entering a room for the first time isn't working yet as far as I know, but it's easy to make it yourself. OK as it seems you want this for every room in the game, have the script in a procedure. Make a new procedure and call it whatever you want. In it have an 'if' if property of an object kind. Set the object to '#quest.currentroom#' and the property to something like 'entered', click the 'not' button. In the 'then' put to increment a value. Have the value as 'score' and add 1 or how ever many you want per room. Then put in to set a property of an object, once again the object is '#quest.currentroom#' and use the same property as before. Set up a status variable, numeric, call it 'score'. Next in the settings for scripts to run when you enter a room (should be in game settings/properties), make it run the procedure. If you don't want a room to do this, there's an option in the room settings to over-ride the general rule (it's a tick box or something, not sure).\n\nHope that helps, if you've any more problems feel free to ask more.",
