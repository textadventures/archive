I'm contemplating using the new 4.0, but don't know the benefits it has.  My game is partly done, and if 4.0 is too different than 3.53, I just might not want to switch over.  Is there a complete list of new features that 4.0 has compared to 3.53 which I can view before purchasing it.",

      "EditableText": "Dear Witchy,\n\nTrust me on this one....Switch.  I used 3.53 on almost a daily basis on my huge game (240+ locations) for the last year and had gotten very used to it.  But 4.0 is going to allow me to cut my finish time in half with its custom verb command area and the container feature.\n\nThe main thing I am enjoying is using the verb maker to create a list (in my case I used the five senses plus read,move,hit,etc)  Now when I make an object (like a background object such as a vase or something) I just pull down my verb menu, add them all in, and make sure I have response for every way someone might want to manipulate it.  I was doing this with custom comands on 3.53 and it was taking months and was a pain in the butt.\n\nThe container command makes open/close functions much more simple to implement.\n\nIf you want to see for yourself just read the online documentation off of the Quest website.  You should get a pretty good idea about how the new features will help you.\n\nGood Luck,\nDr.Froth",

Ok, then, thanks for the response...\n\n&quot;Moist&quot; has been the new cool for awhile... maybe you can update it.
