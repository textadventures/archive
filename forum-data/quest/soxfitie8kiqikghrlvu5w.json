All the solutions seems complex and are probably fraught with issues anyway.\r\n\r\nThe method I settled on is to have one-minute, incremented timer scripts which display a message and play a voice announcing the time, so something like this in the game's start script:\r\n```\r\nwait 10\r\nmsg (\"Remaining air supply estimated at five minutes\")\r\nwait 60\r\nmsg (\"Remaining air supply estimated at four minutes\")\r\nwait 120\r\nmsg (\"Remaining air supply estimated at three minutes\")\r\n```\r\nAll the way down to zero and then a move script to kill the player. Got to work out how to cancel the move script if they escape in time, though.",
