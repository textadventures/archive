      "EditableText": "Hello. A while ago, I was working on a Quest game, but I ended up giving up on it. Later, I had to reset my computer and forgot to copy the source code over. But now I'd like to get it back. \r\n\r\nIt is uploaded to this site, and I wanted to know if there's any way to recover at least part of the original source. When I download it, I only get the .quest file that plays the game itself. I have looked around and found a post saying to rename this to a .zip file and then open it, which I did. I can get a .alsx file out of it, which if I open in notepad or something, looks like it has my game code. However, when I open this .alsx file in Quest itself, I get a strange bug where only the top bar and left hand side with the object tree is visible. The right hand side, where I would edit attributes of said objects, is not appearing.\r\n\r\nI can still add objects and play the game, but I can't edit any properties of any objects. Is there a way to recover any of this to be able to edit it again? Would it be possible to copy and paste parts of my .alsx file out into a blank one and open that in Quest.\r\n\r\nAny help with this would be appreciated. I have a combat system I'm rather proud of and want to recover if possible.\r\n\r\nEdit - I forgot to mention. I can use Quest to create a new blank game, and the editor in there works fine. So it seems like something in my old game is corrupted.",

      "EditableText": "When you publish a game, it includes all of the core libraries. So for example, where your original file included the line `<include ref=\"Core.aslx\"/>`, the .aslx file within the .quest file will contain the entire contents of the file \"Core.aslx\".\r\n\r\nBy default, when you create a new game it includes 3 files: Core.aslx (which includes other files to pull in all of the core functions), CoreEditor.aslx (which contains details of which controls to display on each tab in the editor), and English.aslx (which contains all the templates and human-readable text for the player to see).\r\n\r\nWhen Quest is combining all these files together for publishing, it omits the information about the editor tabs, because it thinks you've finished editing. It also removes the two types `editor_object` and `editor_room`, which are used in the editor to determine which tabs to show for a given object.\r\n\r\nIt **might** work if you go back into the file and re-add the line `<include ref=\"CoreEditor.aslx\"/>`. I'd suggest making a backup before you do this, as Quest can be a little weird about what order included stuff should come in. You might have to put it at the start of the file, or after some of the other stuff.\r\n\r\nHowever, note that this might have issues.\r\n1. If the editor controls aren't properly labelled, try adding `<include ref=\"EditorEnglish.aslx\"/>` as well. I'm not sure if this will be necessary, or if it should come before or after the CoreEditor include.\r\n2. You will be using the editor tab-layout from the version of Quest you currently have installed, but the core functions from the version the game was originally created with. This means that the editor might show new features that don't actually work in your game.\r\n3. I haven't tested this; I'm answering off the top of my head, so if it doesn't work it might be better to ask someone who actually has a Windows machine with Quest on it.\r\n\r\nHope that helps :)",

Extract the .aslx file to another folder (i.e., unzip it).\r\n\r\n3. Open it in a text edit, such as Notepad.\r\n\r\n4.

As others have said, Quest will not know it a thing is an item or room, so you will need to set that for each, but it is easier to do in Quest.\r\n\r\nAll the built-in functions, commands, etc. will be part of your game; you may want to delete them (if you are happy with XML that is easier to do from a text editor).
