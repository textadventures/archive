      "EditableText": "Hi\r\n\r\nI recently discovered Quest after doing some searching on the Internet with fond memories of early Spectrum games like The Hobbit, Eureka and the excellent Quill. I never got into using Quill, but I never forgot it either.  \r\n\r\nNow that I've told everyone how old I am :) I wonder if anyone can help me with this problem? I have some scripts that output messages, but it seems that  Quest messages are always output last. Sometimes my custom messages are actually part of the description, and since I have set up my automatic room descriptions to start with the name, then description, then objects and finally exist, it looks odd if my custom messages are last.  I should like to group the custom message text with the description, which means they should come third. Is there any way I can do this?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance\r\nJason",
