But to say move them from this list and reformat the #quest.objects# or #quest.formatobjects# you have to write quite the piece of code. Something like...\n\n[code:36g4oqqk]\nfor each object in &lt;#quest&#46;currentroom#&gt; if property &lt;#quest&#46;thing#; player&gt; then &#123;\n     set numeric &lt;player&#46;location; $instr&#40;#quest&#46;objects#; #quest&#46;thing#&#41;$&gt;\n     set numeric &lt;player&#46;end; $lengthof&#40;#quest&#46;thing#&#41;$ + %player&#46;location%&gt;\n     set string &lt;object&#46;format&#46;left; $left&#40;#quest&#46;objects#;%player&#46;location%&#41;$&gt;\n     set string &lt;object&#46;format&#46;right; $right&#40;#quest&#46;objects#; %player&#46;end%&#41;$&gt;\n     set string &lt;format&#46;objects; #object&#46;format&#46;right# #object&#46;format&#46;left#&gt;\n     &#125;\n[/code:36g4oqqk]\n\nThat would filter out the players and make the #quest.objects# variable look right to be displayed in the room description, off the top of my head.
