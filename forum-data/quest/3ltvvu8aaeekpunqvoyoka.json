It's possible that if you remove the ID then a new one will be generated when you  open the game in the editor.

You  should find a line that looks something like:\r\n```\r\n    <gameid>8d818a08-06be-4774-8236-0322a1bc4e35</gameid>\r\n```\r\nYou could try removing this line, and then load the game in the editor and see if it generates a new ID.
