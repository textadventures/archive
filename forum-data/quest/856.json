The whole thing is about actions, properties and types.\n\nBut yeah, as Al said, changing the property will change the &lt;tag&gt; that ASL code gives an object.\nYou can also set actions (using \"action &lt;#object#; #actionname#&gt;\" ) and they are dominant over properties...\n\nSo, for example, you have a property 'alias' = 'Lonely girl' and give the object an action of 'alias' = 'msg &lt;Cindy&gt;'... Then Cindy will come across and not Lonely girl.\nAlthough they aren't actually the same, I think I get my point across.\n\nFrancis, if you try it it will fail. String's may change, but the name of the object will not as it's not a REFERENCE. I've tried something similar (placing a variable inside a status variable.... Which works if you refresh it - which I had to do by setting itself to itself - I think I do this in my RPG lib!) and it doesn't work.",

If you talk to the girl changing her name to Cindy and then re-enter the room, Quest then says \"There is a [b:3chz1p0p]Cindy [/b:3chz1p0p]here.\"\nIf you put another line of code such as \"prefix=\" and put nothing after the = sign, you then receive the message \"There is [b:3chz1p0p]Cindy [/b:3chz1p0p]here.\"  It's not the best English but it certainly is better than an \"a\" in front of Cindy.",
