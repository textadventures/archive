I am not even sure of the exact steps to recreate it.  Last time I was in the middle of trying to code or script something from the desktop version and I tried to go back to the other webpage for guidance that was already up on a separate browser and then the game just keeps \"beeping\" at me anytime I click anywhere on the screen of the game.  I want to say it sounds like the \"Windows\" beep, but not 100% certain.  It does it with the left, right and middle mouse buttons.  Typing does absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nI cannot do anything to get back to allowing me to code again and I have to force close the program down and I assume I am losing the coding I put into it without getting the chance to save it.  I can not see a separate screen of Quest up or anything like that, so I am not in a sub screen of Quest, like some programs will seem not to be able to function until you are done with the secondary screen.\r\n\r\nThankfully I was only at the beginning of the code and it would be hair pulling frustrating if it did it when I was almost done with it.  What is causing it?  And how do I get back to it once it does do it, so I do not have to shut down the program completely in mid code?  Thank you.\r\n\r\nEdit: Ok so there was a second screen up, but it was hiding and you could only see it if you Alt-Tabbed.  (I thought I had done that before, but either nothing popped up the first time or I simply missed it.)  Otherwise there was no minimizing it and the scripting page screen did not have it's own separate mini screen on the task bar.  Regardless I got that fixed, so I was just going to delete this, but I can not.  I was then going to make every thing blank, but than others would not be able to learn from my mistake, so I guess I will leave it here...  ^^!",
