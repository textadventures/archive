      "EditableText": "I'm having some serious trouble getting my turn scripts to run and stop running during the game.\n\nI have a turn script set up at the beginning of the game and have events set to occur at specific turns (i.e. 3, 6, 9, etc.).  This was done through the 'if attribute = 3 turns (6 turns, 9 turns), then print 'message'.  There's no problem here.\n\nMy problem is when I try to get events to occur after a set number of moves once entering a room.  I can't use the above method because I have no clue what turn a player will be on when moving about in the room.  Basically, what I want to do is give a player a set number of moves in a room before the bad guy comes in and kills the player.  Once the player leaves the room (or hides), the turn script will end and will restart once the player comes back in the room.  I think this should be simple to do, but I have tried this in three different parts of the story and, after too much time trying to figure it out with turn scripts, I always resort to timers (which I can get to work).\n\nWhat I've tried (that seems reasonable - I've tried a lot of unreasonable stuff too)...\n1.  Run a script after a set number of turns after entering the room = I can't turn it off and it continues even after I leave the room.\n2.  Creating a turn script and enabling it after I enter the room and disabling it after I leave the room = It will enable when entering the room but will not disable when leaving.  I assume that in the enable turn script box I type in the name of the turn script (in this case 'sdts') and disable it the same way.  Also, I am trying to run the enabled turn script after 'x' number of turn in the room, so the created turn script is set up as a 'run script after a set number of turns'.  I'm not sure if that's how I attack this issue or not.  Also, the first message in the script will run after the desired 2 turns, but then repeats every turn thereafter - which I don't want.\n\nBottom line:  I want to kill the player for wasting too many turns in a particular room.  I warn the player 3 times with different messages each time about his impending doom before death.  I've tried turn scripts in multiple ways and cannot get them to work.  The simplest solution would be appreciated!!\n\nJust an FYI... I'm totally unfamiliar with writing code.  I'm hoping I can skirt my coding cluelessness with the power of Quest.  If I have to have a clue about writing, reading, editing code in order to create a game with this program, please let me know, so I don't waste my time trying.   <!-- s:cry: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Crying or Very sad\" /><!-- s:cry: --> \n\nPlease help.

If the player goes north into the room, the script I want to run is enabled.  As you can tell, this runs warning message 1... then message 1 and 2... then message 1, 2, and 3... then message 1, 2, 3, and death while in the room and even after I exit the room.  I have a global turn counter set up which I want to use to count in this specific room when the player is here.  I should not have to set up a local counter separately, right?  I remember trying the local counter once earlier in the game and it led to nearly identical results.

Using a local turnscript, is more for organization ~ making it easier to keep track of what turnscript acts upon which room (by having the turnscript within that room), and etc stuff. But, this is only if you have lots of different turnscripts acting upon specific rooms, and other whatever cases~scenarios ~ game design desires ~ etc",
