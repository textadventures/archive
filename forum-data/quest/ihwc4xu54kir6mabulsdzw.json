      "EditableText": "They're no timers, not in the timer list, just a script to wait one second. My problem was, according to my interpretation of exactly when the error messages came up, that two sounds over one second long were to play within one second, twice, but that really made no sense to me, because the sounds that were to play first in the one second time, were less than one second long. I deleted those four notes. This does bring up one question, though. When using actual timers, that go off every so often without player actions triggering them each time, should we make sure there are no play sounds scripts that are set to hold the game until the sound has played through? Would the timer not just run the script, either from the beginning, or from the point where it froze, after the play sound, set to true, false for loop, was through playing?",
