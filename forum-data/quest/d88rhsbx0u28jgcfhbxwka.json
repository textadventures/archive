Not too big of an issue because I can change it back when I get home, but how would this have happened?  I'm the only one with my account log-in info.  I've seen this pic on other games before but can't recall which ones.  Seems like a security issue unless it's a default pic that gets added on a glitch.  It's a pic of what looks like two halves of a wooden mannequin.  I viewed it on my mobile if that makes a difference.  Let me know.  Thanks.",

It got changed because in your game.object \"cover art\" you must have changed or removed the image, which must also be in the same area as your libraries. On the main quest page where you submit your game, if you update it without the cover art, it'll be blank. You could also leave it blank and just resubmit the picture each time as well if you want. I hope that helps! If you aren't the one who changed it, I'm not sure. But it might be because of a recent update you did?\r\n\r\nAnonynn. ",
