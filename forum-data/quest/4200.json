      "EditableText": "hey welcome to the forum. I think the short answer is no, you can't just upload it to your WP site.\n\nThe long answer is there are at least a few ways you could handle this. You probably could embed an iframe in your WP site and link to your game on the textadventures site. Maybe if you wanted the game behind a paywall you could even make the game private and block access to the iframe until someone paid for an activation token. But of course once you start going down that road you enter the land of DRM and it gets hairy. \n\nAlternatively, you could convert the entire Quest game to Javascript (there's an open source program available that does this, but it's kind of a work in progress). And then upload that and link it from your WP site, so you're basically self-hosting without textadventures.co.uk at all.\n\nThere are other routes you can take if you want a mobile game, desktop, etcetera, and whether you want a free game or paid. \n\nTell us more what you want to do and maybe some better solutions will come up.",
