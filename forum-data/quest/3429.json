After a series of scripted events occur. As opposed to a command to go to the exit.\n\n2. To have a series of objects &quot;turn on&quot; after a set amount of time and then &quot;turn off.&quot; Temporarily making an object act differently because an NPC interacts with them.\n\n3. the ability to hide objects until a command/timed event is given that reveals them. The tutorial talks about that with exits but not objects.\n\n4. connecting events together. For example when a script prints a message, it turns on an object at the same time and then 2 occurs where it is on for a limited amount of time.\n\n5. renaming compass points temporarily. As I want to connect the compass points to objects instead of exits. I want it temporary because I only wish it in specific instances of my game.\n\nin what I have in mind is a series of seats where the player can look. Using text commands as per usual as well as the in-game buttons.",
