I suppose it depends on culture) defined by the connotations of their labels. For example, &quot;Adult&quot; (at least in the USA) usually means sexually explicit, while &quot;18+&quot; is also applied to sexually explicit material. Violence and foul language is classified in much looser terms within existing categories (I know, the USA rating systems are messed up). With that in mind, a Horror game which uses graphic depictions of gore and violence with some foul language would still be classified as just Horror despite the fact that it's probably safe for only 18+ to play for the violence content alone. But in the context of Quest, would such a game be classified as &quot;Adult&quot; or &quot;Horror&quot;?",
