      "EditableText": "Hi all! First let me say I love this website and my very first serious game project is coming along very well. However, while I want to stay on the subject of the main title of this topic, I have to derail to detail a few other things (read: bugs) that I don't know how to fix as I am using Quest and while I am somewhat familiar with it, I am currently limited to the web player/version of Quest because life and hotel computers.\r\n\r\nMore context: My game is about myself IRL as a patient in a behavioral health hospital. Just so you don't get too confused.\r\n\r\nFirst, the bugs:\r\n\r\n- Upon reaching 0 health, both the standard Game Over for dying from anything that would kill you normally and the bad ending of getting sent to the state hospital by the Magistrate would print at the same time. I partially fixed this by temporarily removing the state hospital ending, yet the game still continues even after I die. Perhaps I could program a \"dead\" response similar to Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy?\r\n\r\n- Apparently pencils are capable of exploding if you write on anything other than paper... I removed this. Why I even programmed an explosion to happen in the lobby of a behavioral hospital I'd rather not disclose, it's kind of embarassing...\r\n\r\n- I added a room called Scare Space which stems from a nightmare I once had while still a patient at that hospital, which you can normally only access by going into your room and GOing DOWN. You are supposed to be able to exit by GOing UP (you lose 20 health every turn you are inside Scare Space) but for some reason there is also an exit to the NORTHWEST of the room that can be accessed vice versa the SOUTHEAST of the main living area. Coincidentally by entering Scare Space from the SOUTHEAST of the living area, the only way to exit from there is to GO UP... how did I even do this?!\r\n\r\nNow, the main topic.\r\n\r\nAs the game takes place in a behavioral hospital, I need there to be NPCs of other patients and likewise, staff that work at the hospital, including nurses, counselors and doctors. I want them to have their own A.I. and \"schedules\" in which they go off and do their own thing, including breaking the rules on their own free will (patients), among other random events such as the following:\r\n\r\n- As mentioned above, fellow patients need to be able to cause misconduct and misbehave\r\n- Occasionally with every other day that passes there needs to be someone that comes in with a support animal, the animal needs to be determined randomly (dog or cat) and have their own A.I. somehow, that will stay for a set number of turns and then leave for the day \r\n- Some of the doctors' backstories are intended to be malicious and secretly evil (this will be revealed to the player later in the plot, and ultimately defended against), and so they need to be programmed to periodically attempt these \"schemes\" as they could be thought of, against the player, usually in the form of survey-like questions or brief conversations asking for a certain type of information about something the player did previously; some of these are intended to be legitimately harmless, and in some instances I plan to have a few of these conversations actually assist the player or at least make some puzzles easier, but other times they are malevolent trick questions that will cause a game over in some instances\r\n- As this game takes place in a behavioral hospital, obviously one thing that needs to happen is that the unit your are staying in will be periodically let out to other parts of the hospital like the cafeteria, gym etc. for certain activities; a few of these (gym, fresh air time etc.) are optional but others (breakfast/lunch/dinner, blood draw, medicine etc.) are required. I'm not sure how I could do this easily, if it can be done at all.\r\n\r\nI love this game engine and found it the easiest to work with. I would really appreciate and be thankful of any helpful feedback I could get. Thank you!\r\n\r\n",
