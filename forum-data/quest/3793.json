      "EditableText": "Quest provides an &quot;eat&quot; verb. By default, if you try to eat something, Quest will respond &quot;You can't eat it.&quot; If you want something to be edible, then create an &quot;eat&quot; attribute on that object. If the &quot;eat&quot; attribute is a string, then that string will be printed when you try to eat the object. If the &quot;eat&quot; attribute is a script attribute, then the script will be run when you try to eat the object. You could print out a message and then move the object to an inaccessible &quot;holding&quot; room, so that the object will disappear from the player's inventory (or the room), as if eaten.\n\nIf you could provide more input about what exactly you mean by &quot;edible&quot; or what you want to happen when an object is eaten, I'm sure someone can help further.",
