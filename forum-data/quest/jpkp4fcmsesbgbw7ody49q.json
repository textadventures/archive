      "EditableText": "Hello, I am currently nearing a pretty complicated part of my game.\r\nBasically, you get all kinds of conversation topics you can talk about in any order and after 2 of them a new option should appear alongside the other links the other conversation topics lead to.\r\n\r\nAny way to do this while accounting for the wait function? I am linking the page start to \"player.parent\" which normally works but with wait functions it never shows up. It would be handy if there was a way for the game to know new page links have been added via the \"add new link\" function.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",
