Allow a player to log in or even sign up during play. Probably best accomplished by asking the player to open a new tab in the browser (perhaps an in-game link that does that).

I think it was a review of Signos when the player complained he hit the backspace and was taken to the previous page, rather than deleting the last character typed. All progress to that point was then lost. This is probably true of all online players, if the input box has the focus, backspace deletes a character, other it takes you to the previous page. However, it is more apparent in Quest because you have the right hand panes, and if some of them are clicked, and then backspace, you go back a page (this is true of the item lists, but not compass buttons). I guess this would involve maintaining a cookie with connection details so when the player returns to the page, the game connection is reestablished, and the place in the game kept.\n\n3. Set all right pane controls to silently consume the backspace, rather than passing to the browser.",
