Create a mug object. This object needs a boolean attribute like 'filled'. If you use this mug with your barrel object, set this attribute true. The description of the mug should run a script, where you check this attribute. If true, write 'The mug is filled with rum' otherwise 'An empty mug'.\nFor the pirate it's best to create 2 objects, the unconscious pirate and the conscious pirat. Make the conscious pirat invisible!\nIf you use the filled mug on the unconscious  pirate, make him invisible and the other pirat object visible.",
