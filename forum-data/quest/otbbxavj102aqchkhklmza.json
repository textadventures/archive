If I place it under a room, it works fine in that room only, so, how I must to do to have the sky object in every room without to replicate it?",

On the game object, there is a script to run every time the player enters a room. (Its name is `roomenter`, but I'm not sure how it's labelled in the editor). You could use that to move the sky object to whatever room the player is currently in, like this:\r\n```\r\nMoveObjectHere (sky)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both examples, you'd change `sky` to the name of your sky object if it's different.",
