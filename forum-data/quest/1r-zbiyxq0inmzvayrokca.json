Some of my stuff has been copied from the zombie apocalypse tutorial, namely spawning enemies and giving them stats. I have the DoAttack function but what variables and/or parameters do you add to it to make it run? Additionally, how would you damage an enemy, say through a punch? Can I just make add the command \"punch x\" for it or would I need to create a whole new function or maybe an attribute? All the tutorials I've found cover RNG not set damage, so it's a little complex for me.",

For example, in my Sci-Fi game, the player unlocks a Doubleshot ability early on, which is structured something like this:\r\n```\r\nPlayer.OutgoingDamage=Player.Damage\r\n\r\nPlayer.Target=Whatever Enemy I Ended Up Targeting Through A Complex Mixture of Clones and Menus Since You Can Have Object Attributes\r\n\r\nPlayer.OutgoingDamage=Player.OutgoingDamage-Player.Target.Armor\r\n\r\nPlayer.Target.Health=Player.Target.Health-Player.OutgoingDamage\r\n\r\nPlayer.Target.Health=Player.Target.Health-Player.OutgoingDamage\r\n```\r\nHope this helps start you off!",
