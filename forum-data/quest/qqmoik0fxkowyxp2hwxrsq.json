      "EditableText": "> it is an objectlist so I cannot store it in an attribute\r\n\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\nAlso, the code you posted sets up a separate timer for every exit in the game, which will all unlock the same list of exits.\r\nWhat you want is probably something like:\r\n```\r\ngame.changedExits = NewObjectList()\r\nforeach (exit, AllExits()) {\r\n  if (not exit.locked) {\r\n    LockExit (exit)\r\n    list add (game.changedExits, exit)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nSetTimeout (3) {\r\n  foreach (exit, game.changedExits) {\r\n    UnlockExit (exit)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you don't want to store the list in an attribute for some reason, you could use a boolean attribute of the exit itself. Like this:\r\n```\r\nforeach (exit, AllExits()) {\r\n  exit.reallyLocked = exit.locked\r\n  exit.locked = true\r\n}\r\nSetTimeout (3) {\r\n  foreach (exit, AllExits()) {\r\n    exit.locked = exit.reallyLocked\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these scripts will have issues if you run them again before the timer expires; if you need to work around that, then you'd do:\r\n```\r\nforeach (exit, AllExits()) {\r\n  if (not HasBoolean (exit, \"reallyLocked\")) {\r\n    exit.reallyLocked = exit.locked\r\n  }\r\n  exit.locked = true\r\n}\r\nSetTimeout (3) {\r\n  foreach (exit, AllExits()) {\r\n    exit.locked = exit.reallyLocked\r\n    exit.reallyLocked = false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
