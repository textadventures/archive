      "EditableText": "That's already broken. The `else` clause only triggers if the initial `if` doesn't. So the second message will only display if your score is over 100 but not over 50.\r\n\r\nThere's a few different ways to do what you want; hopefully you can understand the differences.\r\n\r\nThe usual way to do this for a programmer would be something like:\r\n```\r\nif (game.score>=100) {\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    msg (\"<br/> Your muscles grow again, making you visibly stronger\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (game.score>=50) {\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    msg (\"<br/>You have gained a bit of muscle, and can wield weapons better now\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first message appears the first time the score is over 100; the second if the score is over 50 but under 100.\r\nThis is probably the most efficient way to write the code, but can be confusing to a non-programmer because the messages in the script are in the opposite  order to how they're shown in the game.\r\n\r\n(in this case, if your score somehow goes straight from 49 to 101 all at once, it will only display the >100 message)\r\n\r\nAn alternative, often recommended on this forum, would be:\r\n```\r\nif (game.score>=50 and game.score < 100) {\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    msg (\"<br/>You have gained a bit of muscle, and can wield weapons better now\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (game.score>=100) {\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    msg (\"<br/> Your muscles grow again, making you visibly stronger\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the same as the above, but runs slightly slower and might be easier for a non-programmer to read.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative might be:\r\n```\r\nif (game.score>=50) {\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    msg (\"<br/>You have gained a bit of muscle, and can wield weapons better now\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nif (game.score>=100) {\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    msg (\"<br/> Your muscles grow again, making you visibly stronger\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, removing the 'else' means that each message is independant. If the player scores 101 points all at once, it will show *both* messages. I don't know if this can happen in your game, but if it can there's a few options about how it should behave.\r\n\r\nOne alternative would be changing the `else` to an `otherwise`; so that the second message only displays if the first one hasn't. For example:\r\n```\r\nif (game.score>=50) {\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    msg (\"<br/>You have gained a bit of muscle, and can wield weapons better now\")\r\n  }\r\n  otherwise {\r\n    if (game.score>=100) {\r\n      firsttime {\r\n        msg (\"<br/> Your muscles grow again, making you visibly stronger\")\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this case, going from 49 to 101 would display the first message; and the second message would display the next time the score changes.\r\n\r\nOr if you just want the first message in that case (this only works if the script is in the `changedscore` script attribute), it would be:\r\n```\r\nif (game.score>=50 and oldvalue < 50) {\r\n  msg (\"<br/>You have gained a bit of muscle, and can wield weapons better now\")\r\n}\r\nelse if (game.score>=100 and oldvalue < 100) {\r\n  msg (\"<br/> Your muscles grow again, making you visibly stronger\")\r\n}\r\n```",
