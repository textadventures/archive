And I found my first problem right now :3.\r\n\r\nLet me explain all the steps I did in order to find the problem.\r\n\r\n**1-** I wanted move the map to another place. So I found this topic: http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/g_pidpe6reexdmgzjzhdvq/quest-5-8-move-map-to-right-side\r\n \r\nCode worked, I guess, but I found a problem with the Room Picture: it was hiding the description and the type box.\r\n\r\n**2-** After a while, I tried it in a new project without the code, and I discovered that the picture was being hiding by default map without any way to scroll up.\r\n\r\n**3-** Thinking about I could manage to do something with step 1 and 2. I tried use the code posted in the link AND press some blank spaces in order to see the text. It works the first time, but the second time, when I back to that room, the text is again behind the picture room.\r\n\r\n**4-** I thought then about the option \"clear screen when entering room\". I disable it and then text never go behind picture room. With this feature disabled image not hide anymore the text AND the code works (using alot blank spaces to move the text from behind the image). But it looks very ugly.\r\n\r\nSo my question is... is there any way to fix this? I don't know so much about all of this, but I guess the problem is with \"Clear screen when entering room\" and how it works with \"Picture room\" feature. \r\n\r\nThere is another problem. Default map hiding Picture Room.\r\n\r\nOf course the code to move the map is another question that should be fixed later.\r\n\r\nAnd that is all. Thanks to much to all.",
