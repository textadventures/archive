Snippets here and there are good, but as background music... no thanks.  Just my personal opinion.\r\n\r\nI've tinkered with sounds in X2 and Good Night.  In Good Night, I really liked it because the game was short enough that it wasn't distracting or repetitive.  X2 is huge and I implemented sound effects here and there... it was okay but because it wasn't kind of... constant? it didn't work quite as well.\r\n\r\nI think it largely depends on the overall play time of your game.  X3 will have no music or sound effects.  Also, you seem to anticipate this already, editing out or compressing the sound file/quality was a pain in the a$$ when it came publishing time (X2).\r\n\r\nGood luck!",
