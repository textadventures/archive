When I try &amp; go any higher it acts like it is thinking about it, but when it re-loads it is still just in the same place. I have also tried selecting the Object above it &amp; hitting &quot;Move Down&quot; but it does the same thing. Is there a reason why, or is it a bug?\nP.S. This is using the online tool... not sure if that makes a difference...",

      "EditableText": "When I used to do these years ago I would always create a room called &quot;Limbo&quot; and add characters and other moving objects etc to it so that I could find them when I needed them instead of trying to remember what room they happened to show up in first. I haven't done one for ages &amp; when I started I completely forgot to make Limbo until I was about halfway through creating rooms. I can still use it, it just would have been easier to find &amp; refer to if it was at the top... Not such a big deal I guess, I just thought there might be something easy I could do, or was doing wrong.",
