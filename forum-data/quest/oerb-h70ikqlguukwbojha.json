      "EditableText": "Hello :)\r\n\r\nGood news is that there is an input box in the Gamebook mode, and even in the editor (which I use as I know didly squatt about programming and coding :D).\r\n\r\n**IF YOU ARE USING THE EDITOR:**\r\n\r\n1. Set page to **Script** (or script + text if you need it) and in the scripting options choose: **Output > Get input**.\r\n2. Then add (into this script) **Variables > Set a variable or attribute**\r\n3. In Set variable box type **player.alias** or **player.name** or whatever you want to call it \r\n4. After the = sign set from dropdown menu **expression** and in the third box (do not use dropdown button) just type **result**\r\n5. BONUS: If you want the player to see their name/input displayed, select as a next step **Print a message** and type something like: \"So you are called **player.name**, right?\"\r\n\r\n**IF YOU USE CODE**\r\n```<object name=\"PageWherPlayerTypesTheirName\">\r\n      <inherit name=\"script\" />\r\n      <script type=\"script\">\r\n        msg (\"Confirm your name, soldier.\")\r\n        GetInput() {\r\n          player.alias = result\r\n          msg (\"Thank you, \" + player.alias)```",
