There's a lot of stuff I'm still puzzling out, but one question I had in particular was -- is it possible to assemble a paragraph out of messages without starting a new line?  I'm making a character who can change between two outfits, get damaged in various (purely cosmetic) ways throughout the game, and can be at various hunger levels, all of which I've done by breaking 'look' down into pieces, setting flags, etc.  I'd like to be able to say some thing like 'You are wearing slacks, a cardigan and boots.  You are suffering from scratches, have a nasty bruise, are a little hungry, and have no idea what's coming next.'\n\nHowever, the way I have it set up, the out put is:\n\nYou are wearing slack, a cardigan and boots.\n\nYou are \nsuffering from scratches,\nhave a nasty bruise,\nare a little hungry.\nand have no idea what's coming next.\n\nThe game is still perfectly playable, but it'd look a lot nicer if I could make it a solid paragraph.  Is there any way to do that?",

      "EditableText": "Yeah, the issue is that all of those parts can change depending on what's going on in the game, so it can't be a simple message.   So in the example I gave, the message is really &quot;(You are wearing a cardigan, slack and boots.) You are (suffering from scratches,)( have a nasty bruise,)( are a little hungry,) and have no idea what's going to happen next&quot; -- everything in parantheses is something that can change.  Like, you start off ( in perfect health), and if anything happens, it deactivates the 'perfect health' flag and adds a new status flag, so you can end up with quite a chain of them at the end.   The clothes can vary between two options and the hunger level can vary between seven levels.   I'm just curious if there's a way to construct the message so that it'll all run together smoothly.  It's not a major problem if not, but it'll look nicer that way!",
