But the ones that depend on the gender of an NPC will work correctly.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that there are some bugs in this system - for example, WriteVerb generates \"saies\" instead of \"says\" because it doesn't have a full set of grammar rules. But in most cases you can trust it.\r\n\r\nSomewhere on the forums in the past I've posted an updated version of this library that you can use.",
