The other is one where you assign points to the skills.\r\n\r\nI'm displaying the information using the regular status pane, not the custom status pane. Everything works fine when I'm testing the game within the game engine. Each time the player gains experience and levels up the pane updates and whenever the player assigns points to a skill, the pane also updates.\r\n\r\nThe issue starts when I publish the game and test the outputted version. Whenever the player gains experience, the pane doesn't update. When the player clicks a button to add points to a skill, I get an <b>Object reference not set to an instance of an object</b> error.\r\n\r\nI'm using the <b>ASLEvent</b> function on the button to allow the player to modify the skill level.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else encountered an issue like this?",
