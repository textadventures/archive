I say this because he is in favor of the idea to create objects that are &quot;linked&quot; to the exit as a work-around. He is in fact the one who added the work item for it in the issue tracker (see quotes).\n[quote=&quot;sgreig&quot;:rc0nijtt]... Alex and I were discussing this ... he is implementing something where you can specify an associated object on the exit that would act as a &quot;door&quot; so to speak, which you could use items like keys on in order to unlock the exit.[/quote:rc0nijtt]\n[quote=&quot;Pertex&quot;:rc0nijtt]It's here in the issue tracker: [url:rc0nijtt]http&#58;//quest&#46;codeplex&#46;com/workitem/1247[/url:rc0nijtt][/quote:rc0nijtt]\nIt seems like it should be obvious that addressing exits directly would be simpler for these purposes, and Alex is usually fairly open to suggestions for changes (as well as constantly inventing his own improvements for Quest), so I assume he has a good reason for not doing it that way.\n\nC)Currently, the easiest way to unlock an exit is to set a key to unlock the exit all by itself where the player types just &quot;use key.&quot; I don't like that idea, because I feel it's too easy for players; they should have to say [i:rc0nijtt]what[/i:rc0nijtt] they are using the key [i:rc0nijtt]on[/i:rc0nijtt]. I want the player to type in something more like &quot;unlock[b:rc0nijtt][i:rc0nijtt] EXIT-NAME[/i:rc0nijtt][/b:rc0nijtt] with key&quot; or &quot;use key on [b:rc0nijtt][i:rc0nijtt]EXIT-NAME[/i:rc0nijtt][/b:rc0nijtt].&quot; Obviously, &quot;unlock east with key&quot; or &quot;use key on east&quot; wouldn't make any sense. So there are two options I have in mind:\n\n1) Give the exit a unique alias, like &quot;door.&quot; Make a scenery object (so players won't see it) with the same alias. Have the key set to be used on the scenery object with a script that unlocks the exit. This way, when players type &quot;use key on door&quot; it will [i:rc0nijtt]look like[/i:rc0nijtt] they unlocked the exit directly. However, since the exit has the alias door, it won't be accessible via the compass.\n\n2)Leave the exit as a direction, like &quot;east.&quot; Make a normal object in the room called &quot;door&quot; which is described to players as blocking the east exit. Have the key set to be used on the door with a script that unlocks the exit. This way, when players type &quot;use key on door&quot; it will [i:rc0nijtt]look like[/i:rc0nijtt] they unlocked the door itself (which they may have depending on how the door was set up, but the [i:rc0nijtt]point[/i:rc0nijtt] is that it unlocked the [i:rc0nijtt]exit[/i:rc0nijtt]). Now, since the exit is just &quot;east,&quot; players can access it via the compass.\n\nSo, the challenge would be to develop ANY method by which players could type either &quot;use key on [i:rc0nijtt]exit[/i:rc0nijtt]&quot; or &quot;unlock [i:rc0nijtt]exit[/i:rc0nijtt] with key&quot; that does NOT involve using a tertiary object to &quot;represent&quot; the exit.",

I say this because he is in favor of the idea to create objects that are &quot;linked&quot; to the exit as a work-around. He is in fact the one who added the work item for it in the issue tracker (see quotes).<br/><blockquote><cite>sgreig wrote:</cite>... Alex and I were discussing this ... he is implementing something where you can specify an associated object on the exit that would act as a &quot;door&quot; so to speak, which you could use items like keys on in order to unlock the exit.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><cite>Pertex wrote:</cite>It's here in the issue tracker: <a href=\"http&#58;//quest&#46;codeplex&#46;com/workitem/1247\" rel=\"nofollow\">http&#58;//quest&#46;codeplex&#46;com/workitem/1247</a></blockquote><br/>It seems like it should be obvious that addressing exits directly would be simpler for these purposes, and Alex is usually fairly open to suggestions for changes (as well as constantly inventing his own improvements for Quest), so I assume he has a good reason for not doing it that way.<br/><br/>C)Currently, the easiest way to unlock an exit is to set a key to unlock the exit all by itself where the player types just &quot;use key.&quot; I don't like that idea, because I feel it's too easy for players; they should have to say <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">what</span> they are using the key <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">on</span>. I want the player to type in something more like &quot;unlock<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> EXIT-NAME</span></span> with key&quot; or &quot;use key on <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">EXIT-NAME</span></span>.&quot; Obviously, &quot;unlock east with key&quot; or &quot;use key on east&quot; wouldn't make any sense. So there are two options I have in mind:<br/><br/>1) Give the exit a unique alias, like &quot;door.&quot; Make a scenery object (so players won't see it) with the same alias. Have the key set to be used on the scenery object with a script that unlocks the exit. This way, when players type &quot;use key on door&quot; it will <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">look like</span> they unlocked the exit directly. However, since the exit has the alias door, it won't be accessible via the compass.<br/><br/>2)Leave the exit as a direction, like &quot;east.&quot; Make a normal object in the room called &quot;door&quot; which is described to players as blocking the east exit. Have the key set to be used on the door with a script that unlocks the exit. This way, when players type &quot;use key on door&quot; it will <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">look like</span> they unlocked the door itself (which they may have depending on how the door was set up, but the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">point</span> is that it unlocked the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">exit</span>). Now, since the exit is just &quot;east,&quot; players can access it via the compass.<br/><br/>So, the challenge would be to develop ANY method by which players could type either &quot;use key on <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">exit</span>&quot; or &quot;unlock <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">exit</span> with key&quot; that does NOT involve using a tertiary object to &quot;represent&quot; the exit.",
