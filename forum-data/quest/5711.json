I want each In-Room Item description to be on its own line, and I cannot seem to figure out how to do that.\n\nI've gone to game &gt; Room Descriptions and removed Object and Exit lists by setting them to 0.  I only want exits and rooms defined by descriptions, as is the case with Zork 1.\n\nIn the In-Room Description section of each object, I can't seem to add a full return either before or after the description.\n\nThanks, I appreciate it.",
