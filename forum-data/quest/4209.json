      "EditableText": "Hello all!  I have another question.  Is it possible to prevent a game from redirecting to a mobile version of the game?  This is causing problems for me in how I'm trying to display it on my website.  It's also affecting functionality because it no longer removes previous tabs from the ShowMenu function.  Normally, it calls the ClearMenu function and that does the trick, but it isn't working on the mobile site.  Any ideas?\n\nEdit:  Further research.  There is an attached .js file called:  jquery.jplayer.min.js This file clearly checks to see if there is a mobile device being used, among a tone of other things, and I assume that's where the redirect comes from.  Granted I might have the wrong file.  In any case, this clearly can't be edited so I'm wondering if there's another workaround.",
