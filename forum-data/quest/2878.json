I would like to see the aslx-code of the verbs for using them in my game.\n\nAnd there is one thing I don't like in the webeditor. If you work with two-object verbs and change something in the give-section, the editor saves the change and reloads the screen. Now you see the top of the use/give tab and must scroll down to the give-section again. And with every change you have to scroll again. Perhaps there is a way to go automatically to the field of the last change?",
