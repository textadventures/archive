But how would he know to go from B to C, and then later, from B to A?\r\n\r\nI believe the simplest way would be to make a list of the rooms you want him to go through. In your case, the list would be something like A, B, C, B.\r\nEach time he moves. the character takes the first element off the list, moves to that room, and puts it onto the end of the list again.\r\n\r\nSo your script would be something like:\r\n<pre><code>destination = ListItem (<em style=\"color:blue\">npc</em>.<em style=\"color: purple\">route</em>, 0)\r\nlist remove (<em style=\"color:blue\">npc</em>.<em style=\"color: purple\">route</em>, destination)\r\nMoveObject (<em style=\"color:blue\">npc</em>, destination)\r\nlist add (<em style=\"color:blue\">npc</em>.<em style=\"color: purple\">route</em>, destination)</code></pre>\r\n(assuming that your NPC object's name is <em style=\"color:blue\">npc</em>, and it has an objectlist attribute named <em style=\"color: purple\">route</em>.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how easy it is to create objectlist attributes in the desktop version of quest. In the web editor, you would need to put a script like this in his initialisation script:\r\n<pre><code>this.<em style=\"color: purple\">route</em> = NewObjectList()\r\nforeach (room, Split(\"<em style=\"color: green; font-weight: bold\">A;B;C;B</em>\")) {\r\n  list add (this.<em style=\"color: purple\">route</em>, GetObject (room)\r\n}</code></pre>",
