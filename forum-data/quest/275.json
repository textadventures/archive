What is the advantage of this ? If the telnet (or MUD softwares) connection is improved, then people who enjoy MUD could also play single-player games, the same way they play multiplayer games, with the same tools. It would allow also linux/Unix/Macintosh-users to access general Quest games. \nI tried to make my single-player game work with QuestNet server (I installed the options and such), but even if the game runs fine on Quest, it crashed the QuestNet server...\nSome people will still enjoy multiplayer games more, but like RPG and \"choose your adventure\" gamebooks, it's a different products (as it was already discussed on this forum) and it's better if everyone can access both of them. Some servers could propose real MUD based on QuestNet, and at the same time propose some single-player games. \n \n- If I'm not mistaken, multiplayer games allow as many players as those who connect, or as many players as the QuestNet licence allow. For example, if 5 players connect, they will see each other in the \"arena\". I guess if the licence allows only 3 users, if a 4th one tries to connect he / she will get a msg such as \"connection full\".\nAn experimental feature could be to handle special games designed for a particular number of players, for example a duo-game, of a game for 4 players only etc. (think to Baldur's Gates for ex.) ( The different groups would play a different games and won't see each other)\nBut the server should be able to handle as many groups of users as the licence allow (for ex. a licence for 15 users could allow 3 groups of 5 players max). This could allow groups of adventurers such as those in Dragonlance for ex., or mystery games like Sherlock Holmes with 2 players, and they could help each other (think to Maniac Mansion / Zak Mc Cracken etc., even if those are graphical games). \n \nThe single player games run on servers should work the same, allowing several players to play their own adventure (I'd be like starting several sessions).\n \n \nBy the way, probably the page doesn't exist yet, but it doesn't seem normal when we click on the order page for QuestNet this page doesn't exist :\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.axeuk.com/quest/questnetorder.htm\">http://www.axeuk.com/quest/questnetorder.htm</a><!-- m -->",

(Since it's possible to connect to Quest with a Mud client)<br/>Unfortunately it didn't work, but probably with a few tweaks it may be possible to use Quest to play other MUD. Sure there are already several MUD clients out there, but I think Quest could be a very decent client too, especially because of the compass and such.<br/>This way it may give the general Quest system and QuestNet some publicity and bring new people to Quest.<br/>As I said I don't play much with MUD, I prefer general IF games, but it seems the current features of Quest are so close to MUD that it's a pity there is no compatibility yet...",
