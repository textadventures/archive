It can resize pictures in a popup window (the old way of showing pictures), though it doesn't use resampling so it won't be &quot;smooth&quot;.\n\nSo there's no preferred graphics size. I think the most common screen resolution these days is still 1024x768 or maybe 1280x1024, so bear that in mind when choosing a size for your pictures.\n\nYou should be able to centre pictures by using text formatting codes. If you print a message containing &quot;|jc&quot;, subsequent text (and pictures) should be centred. To change back to left-aligned text, use &quot;|jl&quot;. You can find shortcuts to these by pressing the &quot;T&quot; button in the Script Editor above the &quot;Message&quot; box. In QDK 4.1 these will be more user-friendly and you'll be able to press a toolbar button just like in a word processor.",
