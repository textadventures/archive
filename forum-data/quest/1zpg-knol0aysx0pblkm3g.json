I think I played it when it was new-ish, and when I was younger and more innocent. But my first thought was that the gameplay could be easily encapsulated by commands like \"Take (object)\", \"Cut (object)\", \"Use (X) on (Y)\", and similar.

So it might be worth starting work on something simpler like this. But as I'm working on the web version, I should check what's allowed here. There's an \"adult\" category on this site, but how explicit is it allowed to get?\r\n\r\n\r\n(The flash game is titled \"Orgasm Girl\"; though apparently there's an \"Orgasm Girl 2\" out there now.
