(curious minds want to make a note in case they have similar errors as they grow up).\r\n\r\nWhere I've seen errors like this before, it is often fixed by deleting the offending line and typing it out again. It can be caused by things such as having `ã` (u3000, ideographic space) instead of ` ` (u0020, ASCII space) in your code; or variable names spelled with `Î§` (Greek letter chi) instead of `X` (Roman letter X).\r\n\r\nI've seen a couple of people on here have problems we couldn't track down, and when I looked at their files I could see some random character was actually something that looks the same from a foreign alphabet. Most often spaces, dots, dashes, or similar (which there are dozens of variations of). But I still have no idea how these are getting into people's code in the first place; especially given that the people having these problems often don't even know how to type those characters.\r\n\r\nThe only guess I can come up with is if you're copying and pasting code from somewhere else. If you put your script in a word processor, autocorrect could change a standard space to a narrow space, a non-breaking space, or an italic space without you noticing. That can make text look better on the page, but the Quest interpreter won't realise that a weird character is supposed to be a space. Some forums might do the same thing if you post code; although I'm pretty sure this one doesn't.\r\n\r\nSo, if you get an error that doesn't seem to make any sense (especially \"unexpected character\"), sometimes it's worth just remembering what the line says, deleting it, and typing it in again by hand.",
