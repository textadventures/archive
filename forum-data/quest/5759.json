      "EditableText": "I have a trashcan that I have as a container object.  When 'x'ed, the contents are listed, which is what I want, but how do I deal with it if the player types 'search trashcan'?  The current response makes it appear the trashcan contains nothing relevant.  Boo.\n\nIs the easiest way to run a script in the look at description box that makes them go from invisible to visible AND do the same for the search verb?  Should be easy enough, right?  But, I want to keep them in the trashcan until the player removes them.  I have a problem though... if I mark them as invisible, there is no 'make object visible' option when the container is looked at (so in that case, the objects would remain invisible).  I guess I could add a command for the room titled:  x trashcan; look at trashcan; search trashcan; dig in trashcan etc and make them visible AND move them to the parent trashcan.\n\nAm I over thinking this??   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: --> There has to be an easier way, right?

You want the player to get a logical response for 'put marshmallow in lunch pail' but because it will do no good, you can set the lunch pail as a limited container that can hold zero objects.  Then you can print a message like 'It does make sense to put that marshmallow in the pail, but you have a feeling you need to keep that pail empty for now.&quot;  The built-in 'put in' commands for containers interferes with adding 'put; put in; put marshmallow in pail' as a verb.  The other option is to make a command like &quot;put #text# in lunch pail&quot; and give a proper response (if that works).\n\nThe problem is that the 'search' verb is not making the objects visible within the parent container.
