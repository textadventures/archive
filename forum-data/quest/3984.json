I saw a reference to one on the wiki but I'm not sure if it has what you need.[/quote:1wgqia3n]\n\nI've looked at two libraries: one from Pixie and one that is referenced in the wiki page.  Both add some nice functionality, but don't address the issue of the getting consistent behavior between the links and the command line.\n\nThe problem is, as was explained to me in regards to put (which has the same issues), &quot;The reason why is because with the links you're going through the &quot;put&quot; verb. When you type, you're going through a command. It may look the same, but it's not. If you type &quot;put x in y&quot; that is not using the put verb. If you choose &quot;put&quot; on an object from the links, it is going through the put verb, period, regardless of whether you choose a target object or not. There is no &quot;put in&quot; verb on an object.&quot;\n\nI've only briefly looked into the stringdictionary, but either that or the scriptdictionary looks like the way to go.  I have no problem with modifying the verb and the command, just wanted to do it efficiently  (it's a pain when you modify the verb script days/weeks later and have to remember to go back and modify the command script).  In any case I think the the dictionary approach may do exactly what I was looking for.",

I saw a reference to one on the wiki but I'm not sure if it has what you need.</blockquote><br/><br/>I've looked at two libraries: one from Pixie and one that is referenced in the wiki page.  Both add some nice functionality, but don't address the issue of the getting consistent behavior between the links and the command line.<br/><br/>The problem is, as was explained to me in regards to put (which has the same issues), &quot;The reason why is because with the links you're going through the &quot;put&quot; verb. When you type, you're going through a command. It may look the same, but it's not. If you type &quot;put x in y&quot; that is not using the put verb. If you choose &quot;put&quot; on an object from the links, it is going through the put verb, period, regardless of whether you choose a target object or not. There is no &quot;put in&quot; verb on an object.&quot;<br/><br/>I've only briefly looked into the stringdictionary, but either that or the scriptdictionary looks like the way to go.  I have no problem with modifying the verb and the command, just wanted to do it efficiently  (it's a pain when you modify the verb script days/weeks later and have to remember to go back and modify the command script).  In any case I think the the dictionary approach may do exactly what I was looking for.",
