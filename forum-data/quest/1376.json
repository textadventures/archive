Syntax highlighting would obviously be the main standard feature, but what would really be helpful, is an auto-correct function that adjusts your ASL code automatically to fix small errors in the syntax.\n\nBasically, how Visual Studio 6.0 works....\n\nIf you were to type [b:ea8pf1x9]msgbox&quot;hello world&quot;[/b:ea8pf1x9], the program would automatically create a space between [b:ea8pf1x9]msgbox[/b:ea8pf1x9] and [b:ea8pf1x9]&quot;hello world[/b:ea8pf1x9], and tidy it up a bit to form [b:ea8pf1x9]MsgBox &quot;hello world&quot;[/b:ea8pf1x9].\n\nYou could also add a little function that checks if a bracket is missing an end bracket and other things to help fix the code instead of resulting in run-time errors.\n\nAnd just for fun, you could make a &quot;ScriptTidy&quot; program which adjusts all the ASL code so it's properly indented and spaced <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->  haha",
