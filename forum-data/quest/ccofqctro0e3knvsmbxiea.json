If I show a menu and then have the game make a sarcastic response about the answer, it becomes weird when the menu is hidden.\r\n\r\nSo… I'm looking for a way to change it so that instead of hiding a menu, it just hides the non-chosen options.\r\n\r\nI could create a new JS function to do the hiding, that's no problem, and override ShowMenuResponse. But on the web editor, I can't override functions. So I'd either have to create my own function around ShowMenu and wrap an extra script around the callback every time; or print the question and chosen answer at the start of every menu response individually.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out if there's a better way to do this.\r\nI could override the JS `addText` function, and have it recognise menu options. That wouldn't actually be too hard (if a little flaky in the case of future updates). Could then have it play around with the classes, but that's horribly awkward. I'd have to have `addText` watch out for the string `onclick=\"ASLEvent('ShowMenuResponse',`, loop over the classes on the containing div to find the `section\\d+` one, and apply that section name to the span instead. Then replace the onclick with `onclick=\"$(this).attr('onclick','').parent().removeClass('section123'); ASLEvent('ShowMenuResponse`etc… So instead of the div having the class, it's stuck on all the individual lines except the one clicked. But then I'd have to override `runCommand` as well, to make sure it works with manually entered commands. That's starting to get pretty hairy…\r\n\r\nSo, a question: **Which is the best solution?** and perhaps more importantly: **Is there a simpler way that I'm missing?**",
