Go to the processes tab, and you can see how much Quest is using. I am not sure if Quest grabs a set amount, and you get that message if Quest exceeds that, or if it can keep grabbing more and more; I guess the latter, so if you play your game and watch Quest's memory usage you should see it go up and up.\n\nSo what is the problem? Is there a list or dictionary you add new things to in a loop that can keep going for ever? Are you recursively calling a function (i.e., calling a function from itself, or one function calls another that then calls the first), and it has got in a loop maybe?",
