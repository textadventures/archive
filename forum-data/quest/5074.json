      "EditableText": "The trick with #1 is to give your room an alias. Go to each room's setup tab and enter an alias of Long Tangled Path. The player will see the alias, you will use the 'name' when you code the game. \n\nFor future reference, to do this quickly in the GUI, create the first room and give it the alias you want. Then select the room in the game tree, ctrl-c to copy, then ctrl-v as many times as you want to create more rooms with the same alias (but different internal names). \n\nFor question #2, here is a quick hack. Fair warning, I don't know if this is the 'right' way to do it. \n\nFor any room you don't want automapped, go to the Scripts tab of the room, go to 'Before entering the room', and click the code view icon (the second from the right, looks like a piece of paper). You'll get a blank input box. Type\n\n[code:3t5fzl1p]this&#46;grid_render = False[/code:3t5fzl1p]\n\nFor #3, sorry, hard to say without seeing the specific code in your game.",
