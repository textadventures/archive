(in other  \r\n    words do they want to take a shower or bath.)\r\n3) How do I make a QDK script THAT:\r\n\r\nhave the script choose which combination the player has chosen.\r\n\r\n....example: (player is at the bathtub object):\r\nPlayer types something like:\r\n * Hot Water On, \r\n * Turn Cold Water on (now becomes warm water), \r\n * Turn Shower handle on (switches water flow to shower head to take a\r\n shower).\r\n\r\n... THEN:\r\n\r\nLook at: \r\n* bATHTUB Faucet (shows water is off). \r\n* Look shower head (warm water is coming from shower head).\r\n(or) switch it back to Bathtub faucet with the water now coming from the Faucet not the head.\r\n* Look at water and it shows it hot, cold or warm.\r\n\r\nAnd the other Hot, Cold water variations (such as above but instead of warm it is hot or cold).\r\n\r\nIf you can help, please also include which Function i need to use (like a conditional, select case, advanced, Boolean, condition etcetera category(s) to run the script in as I am not yet there to know the difference yet.)\r\n\r\nThis would also teach me how to use multiple items/objects (in a sense) for other things as well so \r\n&quot;Thanks in advance&quot;\r\n\r\nSonny",
