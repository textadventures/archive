      "EditableText": "The most basic version I can think of at the moment would be to give each shop an income attribute, or whatever you want to call it, then each turn add that value to the credits the shop is currently holding. You wont have to worry about disabling it before the shop is allowed to generate income if you set it to 0 to start, it will try to generate it but wont have any effect since it's trying to gain nothing.  I would modify the income value during the script for whatever action you have triggering that income. So with your conditions, it would be during the sequence where the player buys the item, add a first time script that adds the desired value to the shops income.\r\n\r\nSo code would be something like \r\n<code>//this goes in the turn script of the room\r\nthis.credits_held + this.credits_held + this.income\r\n</code>\r\nthat part of the code is pretty simple, it's more in how you handle modifying the income.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't actually played with room specific turn scripts much so I'm not sure if they fire without the players presence. If they do, then simply add the income into that script. Otherwise you'd have to put the turn script on the game itself. which will be slightly trickier but shouldn't be too bad, you then just have to run through a list of the stores then do the income calculations per store.",
