      "EditableText": "Hey Froth,\r\n\r\nNo.  It'll happen to a script that I have just created.  I'm in the habit of not pressing the Edit button, but trying to double-click on the script line itself.  Usually happenes when I'm in a rush.  I see the line and think... ok, click on it, open it up, edit it, without thinking about the Edit button.  That's when it occurs.  But I can get it to reduce down to a single bracket sometimes if I open up the script with the edit button and ok it... then when it goes back to the screen where the script is displayed in the top window, it'll be back to one bracket... but sometimes the evil Element Error will kill my changes.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I remember you speaking about a huge game where evey object was described... any progress?  If so, could you please write it up in the Quest Games forum?",

That should keep things under the two hour time limit.\r\n\r\nI have finished coding the entire story, and the objects for every room (all 200+).  The only thing I am doing now is working on the player journal (which updates as you go along) and the in-game hint system.  After that I am done.\r\n\r\nI am confident that I will make the uploading deadline for the comp. (As long as I quit crashing the program due to size... The notepad file alone is sitting at close to 2500kb right now.)",
