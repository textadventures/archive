I'm fairly new to textadventures, but I really want to add a system in my game where certain decisions impact your personality, which is represented by a few \"personal attributes\". The idea is that toward the end of the game you will receive a certain message depending upon the personality, or \"personal attributes\", that you have developed. The problem is that I don't know how to make these attributes visible to the player, and to be perfectly honest, I'm not even sure if the attributes are actually there. I know it's not a simple thing to just add attributes, but I really want to do it for this game. Could anyone offer me some advice on how to implement this thing?",
