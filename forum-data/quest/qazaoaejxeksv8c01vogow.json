      "EditableText": "So I found several problems when doing my game project.\r\n1. I plan to have my own customized health attribute (in percentage) which should have been a result of the operation [Health] / [Max Health] * 100 but then the problem is, apparently Quest can't count something like this...\r\n2. I plan to increase the Max HP when the player levels up using a script, but then the problem is that the status attribute doesn't immediately update along with the \"real\" attribute, which is supposedly already raised by the time.\r\n3. Attack bonus possibilities: Usually in RPGs, there is something called \"Critical hit\". I wanted to apply this to my game, using the IFs script to apply on the Attack attribute, so the attack, in a possibility (let's say 10%), will be 5, but will be 4 for the rest 90%, but it doesn't work. Help meh please! (T - T)\r\n\r\nAlso, I wanted to make the monster attack after few seconds, but when I apply the script and run the game, what I get is instead me getting attacked repetitively even though the monster is dead :v\r\n\r\n4. Lastly, I want to create doors. Well, I hv checked some posts on the forums talking about doors and locks too, but it's not exactly what I want to do! (btw I set the doors to containers already)\r\nI don't want the player to have the door automatically opened for them when they have the keys! I want the players to be independent when they have the keys! I want them to be given a choice if they want to open the door or not (only if they have the key)! If they answer yes, then the door will be unlocked and opened, and so is the exit!\r\nBut then Quest is just (No offense to the developers) too irritating that my blood pressure goes really high!\r\nI tried using scripts or switches but then an error like: \"Variable _this_ and _that_ is not found\" (I mean, not literally) or like \"String couldn't be converted into boolean\" just keeps on appearing\r\n\r\nHelph please...\r\nMy productivity has fallen so much, day by day, as more questions keep on popping\r\n(Though I'm still grateful for being able to take out the code last time and not restarting my game making from the start. Thanks everyone :D)",

If you have a status attribute displayed on the side, saying \"Health: 30/50\", then you need a changescript for BOTH the player's Health and MaxHealth:\r\n```\r\ngame.WhateverYouCalledTheHealthStatusAttribute = Player.Health+\"/\"+Player.MaxHealth\r\n```\r\n3) You say it doesn't work, but I don't know what you've tried so far to make it possible. Without knowing that, the best I can do is direct you to the function GetRandomInt(SomeLowerNumber, SomeHigherNumber).\r\n\r\nMonster Delay vs Repeated Attacking - Without knowing more about your script itself I really can't help. It's possible you're running the \"Wait X seconds and then do something\" block, and then after-but-outside you have something else. So, in psuedocode:\r\n```\r\nwait 5 seconds and then{\r\n// do thingA\r\n}\r\ndo thingB\r\n```\r\n, the above which results in the code saying, \"Alright, I'll wait 5 seconds to do thingA. Now let me just do thingB IMMEDIATELY. Alright 5 seconds passed, time for thingA now!\"\r\n\r\n4) You have the Door object, and you can Open it. When you do, the game runs a script:\r\n```\r\nif (SomeKeyObject.parent=Player){\r\nShowMenu(\"Open the door?\", Split(\"Yes-No\", \"-\"), false){\r\nif (result=\"Yes\"){\r\n//Do the stuff for opening the door.\r\n}\r\nelse{\r\n// Do the stuff for not yet opening the door.\r\n}\r\n}\r\n}\r\nelse{\r\nmsg(\"You don't have the key\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nLike always, I have to type out what it is in code-view, but it becomes more understandable once you copy-paste and convert to regular view. Hope this helps!\r\n\r\nLastly, don't worry about productivity. My latest game, I had to completely scrap 3 times because I kept finding I didn't know enough about Quest to make the game I'd envisioned.
