There is a sword on the floor, to kill the trolls. So once the player types &quot;kill troll&quot; or &quot;attack troll&quot;, the script I made is &quot;print a message&quot;, that says that the troll is dead. I was told in the other topic I posted that if you then &quot;Look at troll&quot;, the message appears again, making the trolls alive again.

I can't write, but I got good ideas (I've read tons of books, watched tons of tv shows and movies, history:major in college due to being undecided back then on what I wanted to do... that I dropped out of: so much writing... I had 3 term papers all due at the end of the symester and there was no way I could get them done, sides I hate researching stuff to write papers - I can 'free-write'-opinionated stuff really well - so I dropped out ~ sides history is really a dead end carreer choice: museum curator, writer, teacher, archeologist, or lawyer, anyways... going off on a tangent... I'm a religion~mythology buff, and playing tons of games, so I got a good mind for story and plot and like stuff, but just can't write well, lol). I can't do media (graphics, music, sound, animation, etc) at all. And I can't do game design very well either, it's just too overwhelming for me, laughs. I really can't do anything well at game making, laughs.<br/><br/>what I've been working on in terms of RPG making:<br/><br/>1. character creation<br/>2. time and date system<br/>3. (need to get much more knowledgeable with equipment, and especially magic-spells, but I do grasp at least their basic coding concepts and designs)<br/>4. some combat system work (physical melee combat only lol), I'm still working on deciding and in crafting the game mechanics and the game's attributes-stats-etc<br/>5. 'explore' and 'travel' system (alternative, or in-addition, to with using or not using Exits)<br/>6. tiny storage system (object 'folder' heirarchy, got spell storage working, but can't understand Sora's Stackable Library, that's still quite a big chunk beyond my coding ability~knowledge~understanding, lol-sighs)",

I've been around places and such but yea. Didn't want computer science to be a degree because I felt that would kill the interest of doing things such as this. Oh well, some other time I guess. Keep trying though dude im sure you'll get something. I have a friend who graduated last year in computer science and she's working at some game developer place that makes that walking dead xbox 360 series, but she's a tester mostly. Starting somewhere though and it's easy pay. haha. \n\n\nYea Im not pro at any computer things except how to navigate areas around the web. Find sources, clues, words, blah blah blah. Im a good movie reviewer and slowly going into the game review process (but only for xbox since I favor their system). As for types of games I go for RPG or FPS. My story atm is an FPS but it's mostly typing out moves instead of joystick haha. \n\nI haven't made anything fascinating here on quest just yet but your list is pretty good. hm... \n\nMaybe, if you want, we should tag team on this quest game I'm currently making. Im writing the story first hand and just somewhat copying it into quest. Wonder if that's been done around here; a tag team quest game? that'd be pretty interesting. But keep in mind, this story will probably have around 20 chapters so..... yea, there's a lot of coding and programming for this. \n\nI tried to do some 3D modeling for my story and forgot to bring my mouse for my comp from home so.... can't really design characters atm. You should check it out. it's called Blender. it's free and following the tutorials is pretty easy. I followed Tim's blender tutorial on Youtube. He's really good except when you get to coloring the character/making eyes. it somewhat gets complicated.",
