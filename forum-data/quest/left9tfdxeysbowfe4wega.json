      "EditableText": "You could change volume easily within a program like audacity or acoustica, but you would have to know precisely when a player would leave the room.  Not possible.  The only option I can think of is having two similar (or exact) songs playing.  Upload one that you've slightly muted, and upload a second that you've upped the volume on.  When you leave the room, swap song files.  I know it's not perfect and it will sound like the song started off/changed, but I cannot think of a way to change the volume mid song.",

I've submitted a ticket to GitHub, but I still don't know if this _is_ a bug, or just a weakness of Quest. ",
