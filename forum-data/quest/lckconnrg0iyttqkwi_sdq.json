It will restore the object's alias and drop to what they were before the last time the `WearGarment` function was used on it. If you change the `worn` attribute manually as you suggest, this would remove the object's alias (causing it to default to the object name) and it would still not be droppable.\r\n\r\nIf you're following the steps in your post, you also need to create a string attribute `original_alias` containing the object's alias without the \"(worn)\", and an attribute `original_drop` set to true if you want it to be droppable after the player removes it.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to play with all those attributes, you can just make it wearable on the 'Wearable' tab, and then give it the initialisation script `WearGarment (this)`.",
