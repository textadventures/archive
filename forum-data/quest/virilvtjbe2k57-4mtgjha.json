      "EditableText": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI've been using Pixie's CombatLib and have come across an issue when attempting to wear armour that updates the Armour stat when the player types 'status' and presses enter. This shows a table of all the player's stats, but after putting on armour and entering 'Status' in the text box, the Armour rating stays at 0 in the table produced.\r\n\r\nI have followed all the guidance (set the item to wearable and merchandise in the combat tab, protection to 1, torso for the wear slot, enabled advanced wearable options).\r\n\r\nThe odd thing is the armour10 attribute DOES update in the debugger table when wearing the armour. It just doesn't display it in the 'Status' command readout. The same for a ring which I have given an attack bonus - it shows in the debugger but not in the table. A shield I made ('equip' verb rather than 'wear') DOES update the defense stat in the 'Status' readout, however!\r\n\r\nI've been at this for hours trying to figure it out, and am a bit exasperated with it. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI did read in another post that Pixie had told a forum member who was experiencing a similar issue to remove ClothingLib, as this clashed with a current version of Quest (a few years ago now). ClothingLib did not come with CombatLib, so I don't have it. I also read in the CombatLib file that:\r\n\r\n'You must also include these libraries, and they must all appear before this one in the list in your game.\r\n  \r\n  ShopLib.aslx\r\n  ClothingLib.aslx'\r\n\r\nSo I installed ShopLib, too. But this also hasn't solved the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
