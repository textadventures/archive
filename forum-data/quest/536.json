Because if the player agrees with you, he/she will keep the panes hidden. And if they want the panes, they'll just turn 'em back on. As for making quest more graphic, I think that would be a cool idea, but only to a certain degree. Making it a little more colorful, and adding some more interface, but [b:emxdem2b]not[/b:emxdem2b] as graphic as the screenshots that were pasted. Because, quest is, after all, a [b:emxdem2b]TEXT[/b:emxdem2b] game. That's why I was attracted to it in the first place. So with everyone modifying it to make it more graphic, I feel like we're in the 70's and just trying to improve the game's graphics, until they are as good as the games today! (Though I wasn't even born yet in the 70's)    Anyway, that's just my opinion.",

The text thing is why most gamers come to things like Quest.  I think the only real improvement Quest needs is the ability to dock and undock the panes.",

I think that all the options should be open to the author - panes on, panes off and player's choice. I doubt if that would add too much extra work for Alex (though I'm not a programmer so I could be wrong.)\n\nAs far as graphics is concerned, again I'd like some choice as an author. If I'm allowed to mention TADS here, I'd mention that Multimedia TADS allows inline illustrations in the same way that websites do, rather than having special panes for them, and this seems to work nicely for those who want them but they are not necessary for those who don't.\n\nFrank",
