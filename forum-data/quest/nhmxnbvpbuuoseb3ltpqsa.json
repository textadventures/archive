I'm trying to set up a simple machine that's bolted to the ground, so while you can use it, you can't take it. In the Inventory tab, object can be taken is NOT checked.\r\n\r\nSo how do I remove the phrase \"take\" from the little drop-down menu when I click on an object's hyperlink?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
