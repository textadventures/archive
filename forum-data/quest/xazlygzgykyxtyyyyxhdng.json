      "EditableText": "Why have the variable names got `{}` around them? You only need to put {} around a variable name if you're using it in the text processor.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure what your intention is here, so I'll give an answer for each of the possibilities I can see.\r\nFor this example, I'm assuming that the object named `player` has attributes `one`, `two`, and `three` with values \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\".\r\n\r\n1. If you want to add the string \"RedGreenBlue\" to a list:\r\n    * Using expressions: `list add (player.list, player.one + player.two + player.three)`\r\n    * Using text processor: `list add (player.list, ProcessText (\"{player.one}{player.two}{player.three}\"))`\r\n2.
