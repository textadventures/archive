      "EditableText": "Sounds like a cool idea, but really hard, if you have different cycles and weather patterns that change room descriptions. Maybe it would be easier if you, instead of having day/night cycles and letting the players move back to rooms that you would need to change descriptions, would have day/night cycles, but in different parts of the game. Sounds confusing, but here's what I mean: Let's say you have a &quot;Mansion,&quot; and the rooms are &quot;Room1,&quot; Room2,&quot; and &quot;Room3.&quot; And let's say you have a timer that after 2 minutes changes &quot;Day&quot; to &quot;Night.&quot; Now, you would need to program the rooms so that if the player enters room, if timerx is on, display &quot;daydescription.&quot; Otherwise, display &quot;nightdescription.&quot; My idea is to have the whole time in the mansion be daytime, so you don't need to change descriptions based on day or night, but after the player completes that part of the mansion, move them to a deifferent part of the game, say, &quot;the Basement,&quot; and say that now it is night. What I mean may be a little (or a lot) unclear, but I hope you undertand what I'm saying. Anyway, that's what I would do if I was making a game like that. As for help with fantasy-style names and places, if you'd like I can give you some. I read lots of fantasy books (Stephen King's &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; being my num. 1 fave series of all time) and have a feeling for weird names.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",
