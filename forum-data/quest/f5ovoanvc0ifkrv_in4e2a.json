With a little cleaning, it should still be worth something.\")\r\n```\r\nRight now, the code should be only creating TreasureList with items that have the \"Price\" attribute, but I'm getting some strange results, and it's not really what I'm looking to do anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to do is create TreasureList with only objects with a Price of 25 or higher.
