(we're pretending that we've already fixed the issue of 'ingredients' being a StringList Attribute, fixed/changed correctly to an ObjectList Attribute)\r\n1. bowl.ingredients: sugar, flour, eggs, butter (4 items/Values: 4 Object references/pointers)\r\n2. make a copy of 'bowl.ingredients', thus: bowl.ingredients_copy: sugar, flour, eggs, butter (4 items/Values: (4 items/Values: 4 Object references/pointers)\r\n3. for ALL/EACH/EVERY Object(s) directly inside of your 'bowl' Object (NOT objects inside of Objects that are inside of the 'bowl' Object), check if they match up with the items/Values (Object references/pointers) in your 'bowl.ingredients_copy' ObjectList Attribute, if they do, then REMOVE that item/Value (Object reference/pointer) from your 'bowl.ingredients_copy' ObjectList Attribute.\r\n4. your 'if (result = 0)' isn't how the correct scripting is done. It needs to be like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (ListCount (result) = 0) {\r\n  msg (\"You have all the ingredients to make a cake.\")\r\n} else {\r\n  msg (\"You still need more ingredients\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. \"lastly\" (actually this happens BEFORE #4 above), you're storing your copy objectlist into the 'result' Variable VARIABLE\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nso....\r\n\r\nYou almost had it right! (Good Job!)\r\n\r\njust change your 'ingredients' to being of Attribute/Data Type: 'objectlist', and change your 'if (result = 0) { /* scripting */ }' to being: if (ListCount (result) = 0) { /* scripting */ }\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\ndo note that the design you're using, you got to have/move/put/set your 'sugar', 'flour', 'eggs', and 'butter' Objects into your 'bowl' Object, and with the design/code that it is now, you have to have ALL 4 Objects (sugar, flour, eggs, butters) in your 'bowl' Object at the same time, as when you execute your 'mix'. If you don't like this, I can help with fixing up the code for handling this issue.\r\n\r\n(The issue is that you're checking the temporary copy objectlist, which is destroyed when its parent scripting is done, and as well as that you're removing the items from it: the copy objectlist, as well, which it is good that you're not removing the items from your control/original objectlist, but maybe you might want to store the remaining items in a permanent objectlist and check it instead, as this would be how we fix the issue of currently needing all 4 items:Objects to be in the 'bowl' object at the same time, due to currently using the copy temporary objectlist)",
