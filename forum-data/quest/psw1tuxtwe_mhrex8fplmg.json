I was wondering if there was a way to create and manage the same thing in quest? I did see Pixie's thing about the New UI Button Panel, but unfortunately I don't really understand how that's supposed to work. Basically what I want is a panel I can alter with each new room (like the Objects panel) but instead of clicking on an Object to show the available verbs have the click automatically trigger a single verb.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nYou are in a room, there's a bucket on the floor. \r\n\r\n(Then have a panel on the side labelled \"Actions\" that reads)\r\nExamine the Bucket\r\nKick the Bucket\r\nLeave the room\r\n\r\nIf you click \"Examine the Bucket\" it'll print \"It's a bucket what do you want?\"\r\nClick Kick the Bucket, Print \"You knock it over you horrible person.\"\r\nClick Leave the room and you leave the room.\r\n\r\nNo extra clicks.  Then the next room will have new actions to click on.",
