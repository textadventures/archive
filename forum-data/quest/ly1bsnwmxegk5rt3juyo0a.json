      "EditableText": "Yes, I had some objects in the room. Look script would add them to inventory. Inventory script would add points run an msg and move the object to another room, but the objects were just sitting in inventory. I thought I must have forgotten to save or added the script to a different copy of the game and not made the other copies, but I checked the script and indeed it said move (the correct item) to closet. I went and checked the code view because sometimes it has said something different from the tabs view, but it was all aligned. I decided it was the add to inventory tab affect and changed the script for these objects to not adding to inventory and just move to closet, but then they stayed in the room. They just stayed in the room. I looked at the tab. It said closet. It was a complete tab, not an expression, but room or object. I checked each of these items to move, they were all the right items, but when I thought about it, it wasn't hurting the game, just my sanity. Only, now I have redone everything in that area, and I think everything is moving to closet, now. It was last time I played. Now that I think of it, sometimes adjusting score and health takes an actual turn longer than it should (iny opinion) in another game, and I moved move object up to the first thing in the sequence in case it was waiting for status attributes to update, and that might be what was wrong with it, before.\r\nSo.\r\nIt is sometimes an unsettling experience.",
