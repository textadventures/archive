      "EditableText": "So what I'm trying to set up is a multi room fight. The player is ambushed while crossing a river and has to fight back with ranged attacks. I'm almost there. What I did is put each room inside of a bigger room, marked them as both objects and rooms, then had the player enter that room before entering the river. Next I marked each room as visible and scenery so that they don't show up as objects in the main room, but can still be seen for the next step. Finally, I turned each room into an open container so that the enemies can be seen from the player's room. \r\n\r\nWith all of that I actually can attack them by typing in the commands. The problem I'm having is that they don't show up if I click to use the item instead. Since they aren't actually in the room they don't show up in the list of targets. Is there anyone who would be able to help me with this final step? To put it another way I'm trying to use an item on an object in a container from within a different container. If that makes any sense at all.",
