I've been using the attributes (CLOSE, OPEN, LIST) and properties (OPENED) of containers as a way of opening and closing doors between rooms (CREATE EXIT), and adding locks and keys (LOCKED, KEY=) capabilities.\n\nI have always loved text adventure games since the days of my very first computer (just to date myself... it was a VIC-20 ...some of you young'uns won't even know what that is).
