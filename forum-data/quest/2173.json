Is this possible?\n\n[b:24v5fy9c]Clear Game Window[/b:24v5fy9c]\nOf course Iv seen the command to clear the game window, but I would like to clear it every time the player enters a new room while keeping the default descriptions etc, that Quest adds to each description. Is this possible? I played by putting the room description into the script area that runs as the player enters the room, but while this prints my description nicely it erases the Quest added information that would normally be there, and I need that.\n\nAlex: Great program, excellent job. Iv played with several products of this type but this is by far the easiest and yet the most comprehensive Iv found.\nregards\n\nMax",
