In short it works fine when I normally play it, but when I use a walk through with exactly the same commands, I get random errors, and the player seems to get stuck in certain rooms because certain commands are not executed.\nSome examples of errors:\nError running script&#058; Unknown object or variable 'baselist'\nError running script&#058; Error evaluating expression 'LCase(StringListItem(verbs, 0)) + &quot; &quot; + alias': StringListItem function expected list parameter but was passed 'null'\n\nThe game file is attached. There is only on walk through there which causes the problem. I'm interested in knowing if others can reproduce this error, if this is a known issue and if there is anything I can do to solve this problem. I really don't want to continue to far, if I can't use walk through.\n\nThanks for any help in advance.\n\nEDIT: Using Quest 5.5 on windows 7 64bit.",
