You need to use four puzzle pieces to complete the puzzle, so I set the integer to 4.\r\n2.  To do so, click on the object, click on the attribute tab.  At the bottom box, click on 'Add'.  I always name mine [something]Count.  In this case, I named it 'MissingPieceCount'.\r\n3a.  Next, click on the 'Add change script'.  Under this, I added an 'If' script.  Select the 'If object attribute equals' from the drop down.  \r\n3b.  Select the object the attribute is set on.  In this case, it was the jigsaw puzzle.\r\n3c.

In the third box you need to adjust the variable by typing the following:  object.attribute - 1\r\n4d.
