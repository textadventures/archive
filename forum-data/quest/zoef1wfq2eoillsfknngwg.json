      "EditableText": "Hi there. I am making a game in Quest using the online tool. I have very little programming experience and am using the interface to do everything. \r\n\r\nI have a keyhole and I want you to be able to put a long hair pin into it and for it to display a message. However if you try putting anything else into the key hole I want a different message displayed. How is the best way to do this? I have tried making the keyhole a container, but can't seem to find a way to have one message if the hair pin is put in it and another if anything is put in it.\r\n\r\nI thought another way would be to make a custom command - \"put #object# in keyhole\" but then I'd want to have a script IF the objects typed in instead of #object# is the hair pin it displays one thing, and if it is anything else then a different message is displayed, but I can't see a way to do this with the IF script.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help with this, bearing in mind that I don't know how to code. \r\n\r\nThanks very much.",
