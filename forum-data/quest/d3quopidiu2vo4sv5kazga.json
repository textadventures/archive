The game is post apocalyptic, so no magic, and will involve many different types of enemies and potential weapons. If this isn't possible, I understand, I was just wondering if anyone knew how to do this. If it is not possible using the GUI, i'm open to trying out the coding aspect, but I don't really understand what i'm doing. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I was wondering if anyone knew how to implement a radiation system, involving curing radiation, and making death occur when the radiation level gets too high. Thanks in advance.",

Though, code is NOT easy to learn, especially when starting out with trying to learn it for your very first time.\r\n\r\nalso, I personally am not that familiar with the GUI/Editor and its various script options and etc other features/capabilities, and as well not familiar with all of quest's built-in stuff, which the GUI/Editor has a lot of controls for setting/changing/working with. It's a pain to have to open up quest to see how to do things in the GUI/Editor for almost everything, for me.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\ncombat is one of the most complex things there is to code-for/put-into games (it's one of a game's main systems), and even the most simplistic combat system (which it certainly can be, it doesn't have to be complex and advanced combat system), is still not easy to do, especially if you don't understand the basic fundamentals needed.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nthe basic fundamentals (the 'bread and butter') of game-making and/or coding, is learning/understanding Attribute and the 'if' Script usage.\r\n\r\nwith these two things, esepcially when used together, you can do 90% of everything you want to do for/in your game, its: game making/design.\r\n\r\nin the GUI/Editor, these two \"SUPER SCRIPTS\" are accessed via (I'm not familiar with exactly the GUI/Editor's scripting options, but you should be able to figure them out / match up what I got below, with the GUI/Editor's scripting options):\r\n\r\n1. Attribute usage (creating/adding/setting, re-setting/changing/modifying/altering/adjusting):\r\n\r\nrun as script -> add new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = *[EXPRESSION]* VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\n* since I don't know the GUI/Editor's scripting options, I cheat using this '[EXPRESSION]' scripting option, so I can do/type-in the GUI/Editor's script --- note that it's slightly different in format/syntax than coding directly. If you can figure out the right option: [xxxx], then use that instead of my use of the '[EXPRESSION]' scripting option)\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\nlet's say I want to have a 'strength' Integer Attribute for/on (contained by/within) the 'player' Player Object, and for it to have the Value of '100', via scripting (during the game, like maybe you found a super secret elixir item that upon drinking, gives you 100 str permanently), see below:\r\n\r\n'elixir' Object -> 'Verb' Tab -> Add -> Verb Name: consume -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\r\n(directly in code, it'd look like this: player.strength = 100, so you can see there's a bit of a difference, and there's other differences too for other scriptings too, such as needing the double quotes for strings or not)\r\n\r\nlet's say we want them to have 0 str, well it's done the same way:\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 0\r\n\r\nsome other examples (some of the other Attribute/data Types):\r\n\r\nInteger Attributes:\r\n\r\nset variable player.current_life = [EXPRESSION] 999\r\nset variable player.maximum_life = [EXPRESSION] 999\r\nset variable player.current_mana = [EXPRESSION] 99\r\nset variable player.maximum_mana = [EXPRESSION] 99\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 90\r\nset variable player.endurance = [EXPRESSION] 30\r\n\r\nset variable orc.current_life = [EXPRESSION] 500\r\nset variable orc.maximum_life = [EXPRESSION] 500\r\n\r\nset variable game.state = [EXPRESSION] 0\r\nset variable game.state = [EXPRESSION] 1\r\nset variable game.state = [EXPRESSION] 2\r\n\r\nset variable player.age = [EXPRESSION] 18\r\nset variable player.age = [EXPRESSION] 10\r\nset variable player.age = [EXPRESSION] 30\r\n\r\nBoolean Attributes:\r\n\r\nset variable orc.dead = [EXPRESSION] false // conceptually: the orc is alive\r\nset variable orc.dead = [EXPRESSION] true // conceptually: the orc is dead\r\n(choose whichever works better for you: the above/'dead' or/vs below/'alive', you don't use both 'dead' and 'alive' custom-for-this-example Boolean Attributes)\r\nset variable orc.alive = [EXPRESSION] false // conceptually: the orc is dead\r\nset variable orc.alive = [EXPRESSION] true // conceptually: the orc is alive\r\n\r\nString Attributes:\r\n\r\nset variable player.life = [EXPRESSION] \"unknown\"\r\nset variable player.mana = [EXPRESSION] \"unknown\"\r\nset variable player.life = [EXPRESSION] \"999/999\"\r\nset variable player.mana = [EXPRESSION] \"99/99\"\r\n\r\nset variable game.intro = [EXPRESSION] \"blah blah blah blah blah blah....\"\r\n\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"normal\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"poisoned\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"asleep\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"confused\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"petrified\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"paralyzed\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"silenced\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"stunned\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"dead\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"unconscious\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"cursed\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"blinded\"\r\nset variable player.condition = [EXPRESSION] \"crippled\"\r\n\r\nset variable player.sex = [EXPRESSION] \"male\"\r\nset variable player.sex = [EXPRESSION] \"female\"\r\n\r\nObject Attributes:\r\n\r\nset variable player.right_hand = [EXPRESSION] sword // you have to have an actual 'sword' Object created/existing already\r\nset variable player.left_hand = [EXPRESSION] shield // you have to have an actual 'sword' Object created/existing already\r\n\r\nset variable player.parent = [EXPRESSION] room // you have to have an actual 'room' Room Object created/existing already\r\nset variable player.parent = [EXPRESSION] room_2 // you have to have an actual 'room_2' Room Object created already\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nfor Integer/Double Attributes:\r\n\r\nand we can also do arithmetic (increments/decrements) expressions/operations too:\r\n\r\nAddition: set variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] player.strength + 5 // it increases your str by: +5\r\nSubtraction: set variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] player.strength -
