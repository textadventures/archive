And let us presume your character has a gun in his possession at this point.\n\nI then set the character up as an exit (bare with me). I set this exit/character to 'locked' (the game will then insist I give this exit a locked alias), so that the response, should my character try to use the exit by asking Joey for a name, would be: &quot;Go to hell!
