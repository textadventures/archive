I press play, the game initializes, and loads into the first room as intended. My objects, map, etc... all show up, but no matter what I try, when I type something and press enter, it is unresponsive. This goes further, as I have downloaded other games to try out, and they all behave similarly. I've also tried uninstalling Quest entirely and then reinstalling. Nothing seems to be working. I saw a similar post where someone got theirs working by updated the .net framework, but mine's updated already. Am I missing something simple maybe? I'm not well versed in this software, but I would think I should be able to perform some basic interaction. I've also just made a sample game with just two linked rooms. I should be able to move between them, but again, nothing is working, no matter what game I load. ",

The application runs just fine until I try to \"Play\" something, and then it won't allow any interaction at all within the game. I can still \"stop\" the game and interact with the File, Edit, etc... menu. But it doesn't matter how simple I make the game, nothing seems to work when I try to play it.",
