      "EditableText": "I've noticed that some of the built-in commands are using the incorrect pronouns for unresolved issues. For instance, in one game there was wind and I typed, \"Listen to the wind\" and the auto-response was \"You listen, but them makes no sound.\"  \r\n\r\nThis initially looks like the fault of the game creator, but I've run into this repeatedly across multiple games, including the test run I did of my own. I know objects have three pronouns, Gender, Article, and Possessive. But some of the commands are using the Article pronoun when it should be the Gender pronoun. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to fix the default messages so that it uses the right pronouns, other than the obvious but time-consuming workaround of programming a custom version that command from scratch? Thanks in advance for any insights into this matter. I'm curious to hear how others have gotten around this, or if the general consensus is to just ignore it.\r\n\r\n[My apologies if this has been covered elsewhere, as I'm new to the Quest program (though I did go through the Tutorial, read through a lot of the other Documentation, and fiddled with both the design tools and have tried playing a few games. But still fairly new, I realize.)]",
