I've done some experimenting with trying to get Quest to recognize embedded fonts, but so far haven't had any luck. This is apparently something that Alex is going to address in 5.3 I believe, but in the meantime it's a no-go.\n\nIt's potentially possible to change the padding if you download the Quest source and tinker with the javascript and css files, but those changes won't translate to the game if you upload it as the web player is using the unmodified files. Currently, there's no way to change these setting from within Quest.",
