      "EditableText": "So at the start of my game, the protagonist is set to go through a pretty serious trauma. My question is, what is over the line for what the site will allow published here? Without getting too specific, the protagonist starts as a child (aged 10 or 12) and is abducted, but what exactly should I avoid having happened to them during this incident?  I think we can fill in the blanks here as to what I'm specifically referring to, and it wouldn't be glorified in any way, it simply is way to help shape how the character grows and the decisions they make in the future. This game is set to be very dark overall and I would like to know what would be considered TOO dark, if that makes any sense. On a side note, would content like this prevent permissions to publish the game on other sites? (Gamejolt, Steam, etc.) Thanks for reading, I'm just looking for some guidelines before I dive too deep into this rabbit hole.",
