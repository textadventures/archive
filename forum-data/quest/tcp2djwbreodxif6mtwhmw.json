However this won't work with simple **look**.\r\n\r\nI want to add `look #object#` command which does the same. I think it should call script. However I failed to find out what to write in the script. So far I've tried\r\n\r\n    msg(object.description)\r\n\r\nBut it was a wrong guess. Can please anyone guide me for I'm completely novice to Quest and regretfully could not find such info with search (probably I'm using wrong keywords).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nRodion",
