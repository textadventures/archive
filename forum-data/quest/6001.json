It happens mostly when I open a tab with code in it (for example, a custom command with many conditions). Sometimes it keeps running after a while, but sometimes I have to shut down the software and lose my work, because it doesn't answer any more...\nIs there a way to avoid those freezings ?\nThank you !",
