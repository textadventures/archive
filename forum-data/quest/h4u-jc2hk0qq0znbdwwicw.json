Forgive me if I'm a noob, but I can't find how to solve this.\r\n\r\nI can't make an object usable **just** after player have already taken it. In the game, it seems, if the object is in the room, you can already use it, and no need to take it. \r\nIn my example: a guard has a gun (an Use/Give object). You can't take the gun cause the guard don't give it to you, this works correctly. But if you write \"use the gun\", then you can use it.\r\nThere is a way I can allow the feature \"Use/Give\" just after you carry the object? If you don't have it in your inventory, you should not be able to use it.\r\n\r\nThanks for answers!",
