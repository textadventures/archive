      "EditableText": "Coming back to Quest via the online ActiveLit - superb resource for my class but struggling to get some features to work\n\nPart 1: None of my drop down boxes will stay up for more than 0.5s - they are not clickable either. I have tried this on two different devices and different browsers - this is not true of others playing so may be a glitch with something?\n\nPart 2: Really struggling with container types and showing of objects inside of containers. I thought it was possible to open a container and a list of objects to be shown? I am finding with a number of games that objects are not being added to inventory or appearing in the list. I have the game codes Alex if that helps?\n\nPart 3: The use of expressions for the Security Code. I followed my helpguide (ha!) but now getting error message saying:\n\nError compiling expression 'result=&quot;1234&quot;': Unknown object or variable 'result'. \n\n\n\nMany thanks for setting this up Alex. Is there anything you can do with these issues?\n\nThanks",

      "EditableText": "I hope I understand these correctly, but here are my two cents:\n\n1.  I have NO clue why this would happen.  Are you using the most updated version of Quest?  I've been &quot;fiddling&quot; with Quest for 1.83 years and I have never run in to this experience before.  So, in my opinion, I would think it would have to be some sort of glitch/error on your end?\n\n2.  Showing container objects is pretty simple.  If I understand your issue - YOU personally are having trouble showing objects appear? Or are you saying you notice this in games that you are playing? If it is the former, after you have selected the container type, there are two boxes that you can 'tick'.  One of them is whether or not you want to hide the objects until they are looked at or opened and the other option is to list objects when they are looked at or opened.  If it is the latter, people post games all the time without knowing what they are doing!  =)\n\n3.  Personally, I think I would need to see the code to understand why this isn't working.  I have many functioning get input, switch results scripts that work just fine, so it is probably some little bit in your script that is misplaced or missing.\n\nAgain, maybe I misunderstand your dilemmas, but there you have it.  Let me know.",
