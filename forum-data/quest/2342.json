I wanted to test out if the packager plays audio events only once and/or if it happens still in CAS files still. Sadly though, I can't test this. Creating the CAS file went well enough, but I can't get it to load and fully run. Once the game finally decides to come to any senses, it cashes and does not respond. Leave it to me to want background music in my game and cause problems.. lol. Also I've tried to package it, still no luck.. it crashes before I can actually play the game, and test the sounds.",
