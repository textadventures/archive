      "EditableText": "Okay I have one question before I get to my real question---How long does it usually take people to create a game? Cause I started mine on Nov. 29, and I've barely done anything. (Well, I've done a little, but not [b:3cyxg0dw]nearly[/b:3cyxg0dw] enough. That might be because I don't program every day, not to mention for the past week, but even if I [b:3cyxg0dw]would[/b:3cyxg0dw] program every day, I have a feeling that I still wouldn't be nearly done. My other question is, that using QDK, if, lets say I make it so that if someone types in \"create room,\" a room is created. That room doesn't show up in the list of rooms, so how do I create a general description, compass points, and many other things? Thanks---Ebayfan414",
