I'll go through what I would do, although others may have different suggestions that you could prefer.\n\nFirst there is the problem of putting batteries inside the flashlight. I can understand not wanting to make the torch a container that would allow other objects to go in that don't belong there, but by altering the &quot;put&quot; command you can ensure that ONLY the batteries are able to go in. The following code is a universal command that will work for any objects you want to &quot;couple&quot; together. Replace the default &quot;put&quot; command with the following (tell me if you need help on how to replace default commands):\n\n[code:3r32jeco]if (HasAttribute(object2, &quot;couple&quot;) and (object2&#46;couplekey = object1)) {\n  do (object2, &quot;couple&quot;)\n}\nelse if (HasAttribute(object2, &quot;couple2&quot;) and (object2&#46;couplekey2 = object1)) {\n  do (object2, &quot;couple2&quot;)\n}\nelse {\n  if (object1&#46;parent = object2) {\n    msg (DynamicTemplate(&quot;AlreadyThere&quot;, object1))\n  }\n  else if (not ListContains(ScopeInventory(), object1)) {\n    msg (DynamicTemplate(&quot;NotCarrying&quot;, object1))\n  }\n  else if (not ListContains(ScopeReachable(), object1)) {\n    msg (DynamicTemplate(&quot;ObjectNotOpen&quot;, GetBlockingObject(object1)))\n  }\n  else if (not ListContains(ScopeReachable(), object2)) {\n    msg (DynamicTemplate(&quot;ObjectNotOpen&quot;, GetBlockingObject(object2)))\n  }\n  else if (not object2&#46;container) {\n    msg (Template(&quot;CannotDoThat&quot;))\n  }\n  else if (not object2&#46;isopen) {\n    msg (DynamicTemplate(&quot;ObjectNotOpen&quot;, object2))\n  }\n  else {\n    if (GetBoolean(object2, &quot;hidechildren&quot;)) {\n      object2&#46;hidechildren = false\n    }\n    if (HasDelegateImplementation(object2, &quot;addscript&quot;)) {\n      rundelegate (object2, &quot;addscript&quot;, object1)\n    }\n    else {\n      object1&#46;parent = object2\n      msg (Template(&quot;Done&quot;))\n    }\n  }\n}[/code:3r32jeco]\n\nTo implement this on a pair of objects, create 2 attributes for an object. 1 is &quot;couple&quot; which is a script attribute that contains the script for what you want to happen when the objects are put together. 2 is &quot;couplekey&quot; which is an object attribute that should refer to the 2nd object you want to couple with the first.\n\nIn your case, you would create the 2 attributes on the flashlight. couplekey you would set to be the batteries, and couple would be a script describing what you want to happen (turn the torch on, change the attributes of the torch, move/destroy the batteries etc.) Note that using this method you can still move the batteries inside the flashlight without making it a container, thus allowing you to use the conditions &quot;if flashlight contains batteries&quot; in your other scripts.\n\nThe script allows for a second object to be coupled (with the attributes couple2 and couplekey2), so if you had another battery object then you can make it do the same thing when the first set is depleted.\n\n\nReducing the power of the batteries I would do with a timer or turn script, linked to turning the flashlight on and off. In the options tab of the flashlight, there is &quot;run script after turning the object on&quot; and the same for turning off. Use this to enable/disable a script.\n\nTurn scripts can be added in the &quot;scripts&quot; tab of the game object, timers by going to advanced&gt;timers in the object tree. Your turn script would be something like\n[code:3r32jeco]Flashlight&#46;power = Flashlight&#46;power -1[/code:3r32jeco]\nto decrease the power by 1 per turn (setting it to a much greater number than 5 would be ideal). A similar thing would be used with a timer but it's probably best that you have a play around to figure out what type would work best for your needs.\n\n\nTo make something happen when the power reaches 0, you simply have to include an if... script at the end of your power depletion script. e.g.\n[code:3r32jeco]if (Flashlight&#46;power = 0) {\n  SwitchOff (Flashlight)\n}[/code:3r32jeco]\n\n\nCreating a &quot;ghost&quot; room to move unwanted objects to as carrot suggested is a good idea. Destroying the objects entirely can lead to unforeseen errors due to the way that Quest evaluates certain commands. It also allows you to recycle the same object over and over while presenting it as a &quot;new&quot; object. For example the batteries die, you &quot;throw them away&quot; (move them to the ghost room) then move them into another room later for the player to pick up again as a fresh set.",

The ability to make an object directly effect the attributes of another, then destroy themselves.</span><br/><br/>This is no longer relevant for what you requested based on my method, but here's how to do this stuff, if you want to (such as for other things or uses):<br/><br/>here's how to remove and destroy:<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/RemoveObject\">http://quest5.net/wiki/RemoveObject</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/RemoveSceneryObjects\">http://quest5.net/wiki/RemoveSceneryObjects</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Destroy\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Destroy</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>But, as said by the above poster, it is better to MOVE stuff to a hidden &quot;dump&quot; object:<br/><br/>this is done by creating~adding an object which is NOT a child of any room object, this is called a &quot;Data Object&quot;.<br/><br/>for example:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;d83ba5bb-2e3c-4f31-80c9-3e88a2dc082c&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2013&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;global_events_data_object&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;score type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/score&gt;<br/>    &lt;dragon_killed type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/dragon_killed&gt;<br/>    &lt;race_list type=&quot;simplestringlist&quot;&gt;human;dwarf;elf;gnome;hobbit;orc&lt;/race_list&gt;<br/>    (etc etc etc ANY stuff)<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>the benefit of this is that I've got a permanent object, which is hidden (unknown) to the game player~user during game play, which I~you (the game maker) can use to attach attributes onto, and then use them in the game. your own &quot;data storage&quot;.<br/><br/>so, as an example, I can use the above data object to do this:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;d83ba5bb-2e3c-4f31-80c9-3e88a2dc082c&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2013&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>    &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>      character_creation_function<br/>    &lt;/script&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;global_events_data_object&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;score type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/score&gt;<br/>    &lt;dragon_killed type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/dragon_killed&gt;<br/>    &lt;race_list type=&quot;simplestringlist&quot;&gt;human;dwarf;elf;gnome;hobbit;orc&lt;/race_list&gt;<br/>    (etc etc etc ANY stuff)<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>  &lt;function name=&quot;character_creation_function&quot;&gt;<br/>    show menu (&quot;What is your race?&quot;, global_events_data_object&#46;race_list, false) {<br/>      player&#46;race=result<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/function&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>and as for objects affecting other objects' attributes, that just uses attributes and conditionals in your scriptings<br/><br/>an example:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;healing_potion&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;verb name=&quot;drink&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;script&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;<br/>      if (player&#46;healing_potion_count &gt; 0) {<br/>        player&#46;hp = player&#46;hp + 50<br/>        player&#46;healing_potion_count = player&#46;healing_potion_count - 1<br/>      } else {<br/>        msg (&quot;You don't have any more healing potions&#46;&quot;)<br/>      }<br/>    &#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;script&gt;<br/>  &lt;/verb&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre>",
