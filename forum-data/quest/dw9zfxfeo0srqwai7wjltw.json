What I want to know is if I can manipulate the generic Speak To somehow, because I can't find anything that'd let me.\r\n\r\nQuestion 2: Making verbs visible/usable versus invisible/unusable.

I understand how to make the planets random.\r\n\r\nIn this example, I want my spaceship to be able to Land On planets that have Inhabited=True, but not Land On planets that have Inhabited=False. Not only that, I don't even want the OPTION to Land On planets that have Inhabited=False. How do I both hide this variable AND keep it from being manually accessed by typing it in?
