I was running through my game in the browser based player and I noticed that scripts running on a timer run super fast. Also if you have commands and/or scripts running simultaneously, it only tends to print stuff from whichever is newest. These two things combine into a new issue where if you have a few timed sequences back to back, it will not print them all.",

Do you mean they get triggered too often?\n\nThere is definitely at least one bug with timers in the browser player, and it's more noticable if you have a very frequent timer (e.g. every second), as it can cause input to not get registered - it takes a few tries for a command to work.",
