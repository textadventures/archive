Not sure if it changed with Quest changes but it doesn't work now - at least that I know.  \n\nI also need to be able to turn off all window panes during my X3 intro and make them appear when the intro is over.  I haven't gotten a solution on this yet... That's likely because there might not be an answer. Hopefully someone can answer that question, but I have yet to solve mine and I think the issues we have are related.  Good luck.  I'll keep an eye on this thread.",
