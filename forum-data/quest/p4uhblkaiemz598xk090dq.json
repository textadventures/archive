I have everything set up, all the variables and everything working fine, the issue arrives at the end, when I try to get an image to come up to show what all of your choices have done.\r\n\r\nAll I get is the tiny little default image when it can't find the **actual** picture. I've tried putting the images in bunches of different folders but it looks like Quest can't find them? Any ideas?",
