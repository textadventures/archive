This includes my game file, all my image files, any libraries, and all sound files. Only then did the game run properly.\n\nHowever, when I was playing around with a previous game, I had one folder for my quest game (and a retrostyle library file), and within that folder I had an image folder and a sounds folder. With this arrangement I was able to run my game each time I loaded it from the Quest 'recent games' list.\n\nI think I know what was happening - Quest was loading a game from a folder, then looking for the various images and sounds and finding only other folders. I just don't understand why I was previously able to have my images and sounds in their own folders (makes things much tidier).",
