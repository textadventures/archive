I followed all the tutorial instructions on containers and it still does not work.\n\nSo, you need a &quot;key&quot; to unlock the gate.\n\nSo here is what I did as per tutorial on locked containers.\n\n- I created the object &quot;gate&quot; and the exit is called &quot;gate exit&quot;.\n\n- The &quot;gate&quot; is a Closed Container.  I have it &quot;Locked&quot; and with the object required as &quot;key&quot;.\n\n- For &quot;gate exit&quot; I have &quot;Locked&quot; checked.\n\nYet, when you get to the gate, you can still unlock it without the key.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nHere's a couple screen grabs to help simplify what I mean.\n\nGate: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/K8iyc8X.png\">http://i.imgur.com/K8iyc8X.png</a><!-- m -->\nGate Exit: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ItPx6XC.png\">http://i.imgur.com/ItPx6XC.png</a><!-- m -->",
