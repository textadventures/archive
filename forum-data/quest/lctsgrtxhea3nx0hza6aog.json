If you move around quite quickly the default scrolling seems to scroll to the bottom, then back up the first move, then back to the bottom, then back up to the next move, then back to the bottom, repeat for as many moves were made. Doing this a couple of times isn't much of an issue, but if it's about 12 times in a row it takes 10-15 seconds to catch up. If you clear the screen it gets rid of this, but some of my content continues from room to room, so currently, I just have it manually where a user can clear the screen through an inventory item.\r\n\r\nI there a way to adjust the scrolling feature to always go to the bottom rather than to have the sliding to the bottom effect? Or maybe increase the scroll speed? Clear the screen except for the last couple of entries?\r\n\r\nAny of the above options would work or maybe some others that I haven't thought of yet. Any advice on what to do would be greatly beneficial.\r\n\r\nThanks a ton!",
