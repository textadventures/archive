commands*, do work in it, I think, lol), and you don't need the double quotes encasing your message as quest handles it for you (if you do add in the double quotes, those will get displayed/shown in

processor commands*in it too, and also the 'html' code as well, I think): TEXT ONLY, VARIABLE ONLY, or both: TEXT and VARIABLE, any/all TEXT needs to be encased within the double quotes (and if you want to display any double quotes, such as if you want to show that a character is speaking within the game, you got to use the 'double quote' escape command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n \\\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nexamples (not showing the text process commands: they actually make it much easier to write/code, as you don't need the all the '+' and not all the double quotes as well, as seen below for the \"normal\" coding way of doing it):\r\n\r\n```\r\nadd new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\n// TEXT ONLY:\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION]

-> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"line 1<br>line 2<br><br>line 4<br><br><br>line 7\"\r\n\r\nor (I think it'll work, maybe not)\r\n\r\nprint [MESSAGE] line 1<br>line 2<br><br>line

code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"line 1<br>line 2<br><br>line 4<br><br><br>line 7\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nyou can also use blank 'msg' Scripts too:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadd new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [MESSAGE]\r\n(yes, leave it blank, as seen above)\r\n\r\n// or\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"\"\r\n(yes, leave it blank, but you still need the double quotes, as seen above)\r\n```\r\n\r\nan example:\r\n\r\nin code (lazy)\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"line 1\")\r\nmsg (\"line 2\")\r\nmsg (\"\")\r\nmsg (\"line 4\")\r\nmsg (\"\")\r\nmsg
