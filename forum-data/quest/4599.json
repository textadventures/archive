Upgrading to 5.5.1 it says\n\nError running script&#058; Unrecognised element 'span'\n\n\nError running script&#058; Unrecognised element 'span'\nError running script&#058; Unrecognised element 'div'\nError running script&#058; Error compiling expression 'ListExclude(ScopeVisibleNotHeldNotScenery(), game.pov)': FunctionCallElement: Could find not function 'ListExclude(QuestList`1, Object)'\nSorry, an error occurred.\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.   at TextAdventures.Quest.WorldModel.UpdateObjectsList(String scope, ListType listType)   at TextAdventures.Quest.WorldModel.UpdateObjectsList()   at TextAdventures.Quest.WorldModel.UpdateLists()   at TextAdventures.Quest.WorldModel.b__12()\n\n\nAnd says “Game Over This game has finished.” on the right hand side.\n\nI would have thought when I updated Quest, it would be compatible with an older version.  Also when I updated, it did not simply make my older Quest to the newer version.

It kept telling me to roll the dice and buy an assortment of equipment and provisions, but I saw no online dice roller or things to click for equipment or how to even spend my gold...  reading the author's notes I see you are suppose to use your own six sided dice and keep track of your stats...  So never mind on that problem.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->   )\n\nSo I decided to back up my game files for safe keeping and erased all of Quest and began from scratch, hoping that would fix the issue.  It did not.  (I am now at just 5.5 thinking maybe that would have helped, but it did not.) I know I could simply download an older version of Quest, hoping that would solve part of my problem, but it would not solve the main issue of others with updated versions being able to play it once mine are finished and as I said, both are nearly at least in Beta form anyway.\n\nHow do I go about fixing this?  I only included the short message I received and not the game file itself.  I am hoping there is a quick and simple fix to this and I am sure others have had similar issues with updated versions, but probably not as many finding out years later that there was a problem.  I did search the first three pages and not sure what kind of key words to use in the search bar, so please bear with me.
