I'm not thick by all means but cannot get my head round it all. I was wondering how many others would stay on 5.2 and is it worth trying to finish the game in 5.2. By the way rock on Tomb Raider just finished not bad at all.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> Happy Adventuring  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
