If you set an exit to go to the same room, the player does not move and the descriptions and scripts do not kick in.\n\nI would set up a script on the exit to fake going into the room. You might want to look into the code view and see what the script names are for the scripts you are using, but say you have a script that fires the first time the player enters the room (which is called firstenter), it might look like this:\n[code:2w5gfubh]Run object &#91;name&#93; &#91;myroom&#93; script attribute &#91;name&#93; |firstenter|\n    Using parameter dictionary |      |\nPrint &#91;expression&#93; |myroom&#46;description |[/code:2w5gfubh]\nYou may need to change the order and play around with it.",
