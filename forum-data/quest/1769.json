I have a few questions and thoughts so excuse the length of my first post.\r\n\r\nI'm just starting out with making a random story to try a learn the basics.\r\n\r\nI've tried searching the forums for advice on certain topics but it can be abit if hit and miss finding the answers. So i thought why not ask instead since i know what i want to achieve.\r\n\r\nAlso I have found the Pdf tutorial for Quest a little vague in some areas. \r\nNot always showing various examples of given features in how they can be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm wanting to have a yes and no response to a question given to the player, which plays in with the dialogue flow.  The answer was to be yay or nay, so i setup yay and nay each as custom command words (in command tree above room tree in editor) and a reply flag to on for yay and off for nay.  \r\n\r\nWhich ever response given the dialogue will THEN continue.    Trouble is the flag natural state is off until its turned on, right. So my conditional IF settings in the script for character whom player has conversation with doesn't wait for input from player but sees flag is off so it continues on displaying text i had set for nay/no.  \r\nHow do i get script to wait for that before moving onto checking flags/conditions? or an alternative means of doing the same thing?\r\n\r\nI could use menu popups for this sort of thing and I have used successfully the Menu system for multiply choices for choosing 1 object.  \r\nI want to learn how to do something as simple as my dialogue example above within game window itself. \r\n\r\nCorrect me if im wrong, i cant remember where i read about libraries, but is it for people to customise and add scripts in menu form to use within editor?  If that is the case, i would of thought with some of the programming whizzes on here that a pile of them would of been made for everyone to use adding extra flexiability to Quest for newbies and intermediate users.

I've checked out the wiki page for this forum, and it hasnt got much info to learn from sadly.

      "EditableText": "Hey, welcome.\r\n\r\nRight a much easier way of doing a responce is to to use 'enter next command into a string' script, this means that the next thing the player types doesn't run like normal but instead is stored as a string, you can then do an IF (conditional) to see if it's equal to say 'yes' OR 'yay' OR 'yeh' (etc) THEN run the the scripts you want if they said yes, in the else put the 'no' answer stuff. Just repeat that process for whenever you want the player to reply, and keep going.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do it differently, put the specific yes/no 'if' stuff into a procedure (tools/procudures), have 'enter into script' , and then the IF, the 'yes' responce should turn flag 'yes' on. and 'no' should nothing. This is the clever bit, just above where you have the 'enter into string' script (you can re-order the lines using the up and down arrows at the top), put a 'turn flag 'yes' off'.\r\n\r\nIn the speak section of the person (which is where I'm assuming you're running the conversation from), have them say their thing, and when you want a responce, run the procedure (run script/run procedure), after have an IF seeing if the flag is on... THEN will be what they say to 'yes', ELSE to 'no'.\r\n\r\nExpanding upon this:\r\nYou could put a number before different responses which are more than just 'yes' or 'no', then IF to see which number they typed, so what they said.\r\n\r\nAnother way of doing talking:\r\nHave an 'ask (person) about (topic)' command. This is a little tricker to do though, and can be done a few ways. First way is it runs a procedure, which firstly turns a flag off, then has several IF's after each other (not inside eeach other) to see what 'topic' it is, then it can IF's to see what people say to that or the 'default' reply is (if they don't use one of the others). There is a slightly different way of doing that bit but with properties (which i'm using in my game).\r\n\r\nIn each topic script (the bit for responses), you also put a line in to turn the flag on. After all that topic stuff, you have one final IF to see if the flag is still off (topic not valid), and say 'I don't know what you're talking about' kind of response.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you understand this and it was helpful, if not just ask and I'll try to help some more. <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->",
