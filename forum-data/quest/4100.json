Outside of a switch statement (which is just a more concise form of a *specific case* of an if/else), they all have their own unique applications that don't overlap. As an analogy, you can use subtraction to perform integer division, but that doesn't mean subtraction and division are the same functionality.\n\nAn &quot;if&quot; statement allows conditional code to be executed. It takes a Boolean expression which is evaluated and if the value is true, then the statements within the block are executed. This can be used for any Boolean gating of program flow and is a fundamental construct.\n\nA &quot;switch&quot; statement is an alternate form of a *specific case* of a multiple if/else statement, where you have a single value that you are comparing to multiple values, with statement blocks executed for the various cases. You can always rewrite a switch with if/else's.\n\nA script dictionary is a data construct that maps keys to scripts. It can be used for whatever you wish. There is not necessarily even the notion of code being executed with a script dictionary (just as there is no implicit requirement about what you do with the value you get from any other dictionary). You could look up a script value and assign it to a variable for later use, for example, where such use possibly never even becomes necessary.\n\nOne thing to be careful about is not to confuse the &quot;statement blocks&quot; of the if/else/switch statements with a script in its own right. A script is a data entity that consists of a statement block as well, but what you see in an if statement is not &quot;a script&quot; as such. The important distinction here is that of context. Statement blocks for if/else/switch statements are executed within the context of the containing block. So all defined variables are visible. When you invoke a script, the statements within that script are executed in an entirely new context. That means that you could not, for example, *generally* replace a switch statement with scripts executed from a script dictionary, as the overall execution context would be lost if scripts were used. To that extent, especially, they are very much not equivalent.",

If you have a switch statement where none of the cases set any local variables (e.g. they all just go off and do something to global state somewhere) so that they are not dependent on the local function's context, then they could all be put a script dictionary indexed by the key values you would use in your cases.
