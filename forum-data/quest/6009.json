The game installed fine, but when I boot it up, I can't click anything. Does anyone know a solution to this? Those two steps are all I did, but the game appears on the first screen and is unclickable when booted up. Also, if I want to upload this to Google Playstore afterwards, could someone help with that by providing a step by step process?
