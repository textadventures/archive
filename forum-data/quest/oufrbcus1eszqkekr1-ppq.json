I want **one picture per room**. (static pictures won't work properly with grid)\r\nSo instead I put the image directly in the text.\r\nThis however, resulted in the page not scrolling down enough to see all the text IF any.\r\nI am absolutely positive that **the image is not seen as its size, rather as one line**, resulting in too little scrolling down.\r\n\r\nI am fine with a ```ClearScreen``` IF it wouldn't instantly switch pages. (i like some animation, like scrolling)\r\nI am also fine with something that would force the adventure to scroll entirely down when a new room is entered.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has a clue how to fix this problem, I'd love to hear suggestions.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n~sirwacka",
