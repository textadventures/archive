They make it seem very simple, but don't continue the example with eggs and flour etc.  So I'm at a dead end.\r\n\r\nSo in my game the player has some water.  I set the attribute 'volume' to integer '1000' then the 'look at' description to the expression \"You have \" + water.volume + \"ml of cool, refreshing water left.\"\r\n\r\nNow I want the player to spill 100ml of water if they drop it.  So obviously the volume attribute needs to be  - 100 each time they drop it.\r\nI've fiddled around but I just can't find the way to do it.\r\nThanks in advance for your help.",
