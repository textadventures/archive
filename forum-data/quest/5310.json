      "EditableText": "Along the lines of what Adammadam posted - \n\n1 &amp; 2.  Pixie or Jay (or another) will likely stroll along and help with the first two questions you have.\n\n3.  I just finished something similar in my game.  That is, using a computer to essential look things up.  Here is what I did:\n\nA.  I added a computer object.\nB.  In my case I had the computer on already and not able to be turned off seeing as there was no need for that.\nC.  When the player types 'use computer', I use a 'get input' script.  In your case you might first print a message like &quot;What search engine would you prefer to use - 1.  'Google', 2. 'Yahoo', or 3. 'Bing'?&quot; followed by a 'get input' script.  Under the 'Then' run a 'Switch' script and add the 'cases' you want.  For your cases, you might have &quot;1&quot;,&quot;Google&quot;,&quot;google&quot; and &quot;2&quot;,&quot;Yahoo&quot;,&quot;yahoo&quot; and &quot;3&quot;,&quot;Bing&quot;,&quot;bing&quot;.\nD.  Double click the &quot;1&quot;,&quot;Google&quot;,&quot;google&quot; case and you will have a pop-up Script Editor Box.  Add a 'print message' script with something like &quot;What would you like to search on google?&quot; followed by another 'get input' 'then' 'switch' script.\nE.  Add your relevant cases again and offer information for their searches.\nF.  Under the 'default' part of the 'switch' script, add a 'print message' like &quot;You search for that on Google, but nothing really catches your attention.\nG.  After &lt;b&gt;every&lt;/b&gt; possible search they can perform, add a 'print message' at the end of the information you present to them that reads something like this.  &quot;Would you like to perform another search?  Yes or No?&quot;\nH.  After this, add another 'get input', 'switch' with 'yes' and 'no' cases.\nI.  Add a function.  Bottom of your menu screen on the left in the editor page.  Give it a name like &quot;google loop&quot;\nJ.  Under the 'yes' option, add a 'call function' and call &quot;google loop&quot;.  Under the 'no' option print a message like &quot;You decide to take a break from searching the internet.&quot;  *I'm not sure if the following is required or not (I don't think so), but I didn't want to screw up my function too bad, but I also put a 'move object to current room' and moved my player to that room.  Try it without, and if the no part of the script isn't working, add that last bit... =P\nK.  Copy your A-J steps above and paste them in the function you've created called &quot;google loop&quot;.\n\nThis should create a never ending internet search loop until the player chooses to type 'no'.\n\nThis should work unless my description above has a fatal flaw.  But, from memory, those are the steps I used and it is working with 99% accuracy!\n\nAlso, you will DEFINITELY want to make sure you type carefully in the case scripts.  If you are searching for cats, for example... After you click (+case), there will be a little box there.  You need to type it in exactly as you want it.  For example, in the box --&gt; &quot;Cats&quot;,&quot;cats&quot;,&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;Cat&quot;,&quot;Feline&quot;,&quot;feline&quot;,&quot;Felines&quot;,&quot;felines&quot;\n\nIf you accidentally have --&gt; &quot;cats&quot;... ... ... &quot;cats&quot;  it will crash the script.  I know there is a way to ignore capital letters and run partial inputs only and correct for misspellings, but I was not willing to learn it because it looked pretty complicated.  Someone on here may give you an easier way to input cases to make you work a little simpler.\n\nI hope I didn't muddle that up too bad.\n\nGood luck!  Ask questions if you don't understand, and if anyone notices a mistake in my little format there, please correct it before DGN gets too confused!!  Thanks!\n\nXanMag\n\nEDIT.. I see your recent post and I would suggest NOT adding them as objects if all you have to do is search for information on them!  =)\n\nFor clarification (maybe! =)\nBelow is a very small portion of the code I used for the program.

      "EditableText": "A 'switch' basically works like an 'if' statement with multiple possible outcomes, you can really use either to accomplish the same thing but switches are a bit easier to use and read for choices or input with multiple results in my opinion. a 'case' is basically one of your if checks. So for an on/off switch, you would have two cases that are just &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;. The switches are also a bit nicer to work with multiple inputs, as said above you can separate each trigger for each case with a comma ',' to denote an 'or', ie: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;google = user entered &quot;1&quot; or &quot;google&quot;, either will be considered a match for that case.\n\nA trick with the 'get input' script is that you can then modify the 'result' variable that holds the player input either before or while comparing search terms for your switch. For example 'switch ( LCase(result) )' will make the result variable all lower case before comparing it to your cases. for the GUI editor that would equate to just entering 'LCase(result)' in the first box for the switch.\n\nEDIT: also for a switch, below the cases is a section called 'default' this is what happens if the check matches none of your cases, or in comparison with an 'if' statement, this is the 'else' part.",

So for an on/off switch, you would have two cases that are just &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;. The switches are also a bit nicer to work with multiple inputs, as said above you can separate each trigger for each case with a comma ',' to denote an 'or', ie: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;google = user entered &quot;1&quot; or &quot;google&quot;, either will be considered a match for that case.<br/><br/>A trick with the 'get input' script is that you can then modify the 'result' variable that holds the player input either before or while comparing search terms for your switch. For example 'switch ( LCase(result) )' will make the result variable all lower case before comparing it to your cases. for the GUI editor that would equate to just entering 'LCase(result)' in the first box for the switch.<br/><br/>EDIT: also for a switch, below the cases is a section called 'default' this is what happens if the check matches none of your cases, or in comparison with an 'if' statement, this is the 'else' part.",
