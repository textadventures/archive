Now add new script tick variables then tick increase object counter, object is **player** counter is **gamescore** (so in code player.gamescore). Now click on tab Game at top find **scripts** now add a new script to **start script**, now we find variables tick on set variable or attribute now we set **player.gamescore** expression **0** this sets the variable so the counter knows what it adding to. Now when you want to gall it before game is over so I made a function called gameover then in code view add this\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"It took you \" +player.gamescore+ \" seconds to finish the game\")\r\nwait {\r\n  finish\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow all you need to have is a way to finish the game like getting an item then on pickup you call this function and thats it. Sorry so long but not as good with online and way more to do just to set a attribute in online version vs desktop version, hope it helps.",
