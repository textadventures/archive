Whenever certain things happen, I increase this ContentCount by one.\r\n\r\nWhen the player chooses to end the game, I want to print that integer attribute.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n'You've chosen to end the game with a score of x/20' with 'x' being the current ContentCount integer.  I do not want to use score in the game, I just want to count the number of things collected and reference it at game's end.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
