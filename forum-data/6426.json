I already downloaded the CYOA library and added it to my current &quot;project research&quot;, but never risked going to the &quot;Page&quot; tab and marking &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;Is a page?&quot; because i do not understand all the implications of doing so.\n\nFinally, comes the main question: What changes on an object/room if i decide to turn it into a page using the CYOA.aslx? May someone list the changes it makes to the game? Is there any sort of documentation i could consult? Actually, i am a little concerned on using the page option because now i am understanding how Quest works and how use rooms as pages in some sense and i fear using this option may change things radically to a point where i must rethink and understand again all mechanisms i planned using. \n\nComplementary, i would like asking is someone may tell me why Text Processor's commands are not all working on Room descriptions. i tried using hyperlinks such as {object:name} or {object:name:link text} or even {exit:name} and none is working properly. As an example, the first one - {object:name} - is only displaying the object's name, but not creating a hyperlink as desired.\n\nThanks in advance, people!",

I don't know Gamebook that well, but I don't think the 'page' Objects do anything else, aside from the 'page linking' capabilities. Otherwise, if you leave it non-declared, I'm assuming again you have all of the capabilities as you normally do of Objects in the actual Text Adventure. The 'page linking' capability is the main difference between Text Adventure and Game Book, aside from the much more limited capabilities of the Game Book (as a CYOA doesn't need/use all of the RPG-like capabilities that a Text Adventure has/needs).\n\nthat said, wait for the actual-correct response from Pixie him self/her self, lol",

      "EditableText": "I may say HK and Pixie are opening my eyes for a lot of fun stuff to be made on Quest. Another topic came to my mind. I realized game books has that beautiful script for &quot;if player seen page &quot; what makes me wonder if text adventures has a &quot;if player been room&quot; script. \n\nI imagine I could set a variable stored as &quot; player.seen &quot; and set as a string list. Every page relevant to be tracked  (which would be all of them, if desired) would have a script running to add the room's name to the list. I suppose every script of these should be different, detailing the name of the given room as I cannot imagine a way to make a generic script to do this on every page.
