[b:2sjfp3pu]Brettbixler[/b:2sjfp3pu] already posted a similar question some time ago, but nobody answered, so I'll try again:\n\nIn the web-version, in the ask/tell-section, there seems to be a problem with the if-script. Every time I try to type in an &quot;if&quot;-premise in the &quot;ask&quot;-section, the data gets erased as soon as I hit save or enter the game. Anybody out there who knows how to get around this?\n\nAlso, as Brettbixler noted, in the &quot;print-message-box&quot; in the &quot;ask&quot;-section, the only way to make the text stay, is if you type it in directly in the code view-box. Not that big of a deal, just puzzling.\n\nAre there any mac-users out there who knows a reliable (and preferably free) way to get to use the desk-top version of Quest on their mac?\n\nThanks, and thank you so much to the developers for this incredibly cool platform!\n\nChristian.",
