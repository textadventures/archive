I don't know any other operating system like windows, but i can tell you a few cars which are practically the same, by different companies.  You can't really compare Windows with Linux or Mac, however, there is an operating system called Lindows (i think its that), pretty funny.  But from my experiences, windows, linux, and mac are very different, and if you all wanted to use quest, you would HAVE to use windows as it only runs on windows (im assuming).  And games that only run on windows, there are alot of other things which run specifically on windows, and if you have Mac or Linux or whatever, you can't use them, for me, i wouldnt use anything BUT windows.\n\nSo i think if windows was the only OS out there, it would still improve, it would have to as more and more games, software applications etc are being developed and advancing more and more each day, so Microsoft operating systems would need to be improved to keep up with hardware and software, or else we'd all be stuck playing PacMan for the rest of our lives.  <!-- s:cry: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Crying or Very Sad\" /><!-- s:cry: -->",

You can't really compare Windows with Linux or Mac, however, there is an operating system called Lindows (i think its that), pretty funny.  But from my experiences, windows, linux, and mac are very different, and if you all wanted to use quest, you would HAVE to use windows as it only runs on windows (im assuming).  And games that only run on windows, there are alot of other things which run specifically on windows, and if you have Mac or Linux or whatever, you can't use them, for me, i wouldnt use anything BUT windows.<br/><br/>So i think if windows was the only OS out there, it would still improve, it would have to as more and more games, software applications etc are being developed and advancing more and more each day, so Microsoft operating systems would need to be improved to keep up with hardware and software, or else we'd all be stuck playing PacMan for the rest of our lives.  <!-- s:cry: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Crying or Very Sad\" /><!-- s:cry: -->",
