Thoughts?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, anyone know how to \"override\" something? Cause the Clock Lib apparently needs me to override EachTurn.\r\n\r\nAlso for consideration, what do you guys think of giving the player a \"natural healing\" where every 5 minutes (5 turns), the player heals 1 HP and recovers 1 MP? Or maybe equal to their level, so it actually scales up as the game goes on, if I add HP and MP increasing with level as well.",
