In the debug \"tools\" it'd be nice if there was an option to see what flags are currently turned on, even if it just listed them with 0's and 1's.\n\nIn the documentation, it isn't made clear wether \"outputon\" and \"outputoff\" work in the context of QuestNet, and while it's easy to test it for yourself, it should probably list if it's functional, and if it stops output in the context of the player running the script that calls it(good idea), stops output to the server window, or stops all game output completely.\n\nAlso, I haven't tested it a bunch, but I think there may be some problem with the SPEAK code and it not working with the default text to speech installed on windows xp. BUT, like I said, I haven't tested it too much. \n\nUm, overall, it seems good though.",
