      "EditableText": "I should know this (I've been saying this a lot lately)...\n\nbut when I add a verb to an object, sometimes I can't add multiple verbs at once.  The example I gave is one of them and I'm pretty sure that it has happened before with similar verbs.\n\nI have the object children and they are playing a game.  I want to add the verb 'watch' to the children, but I also want to add the verb 'observe' since they mean the same thing.  When I type 'watch; observe' it deletes the 'observe' part.  Is that because it is a bulit-in equivalent to 'look at'?  If so, is there a way to remove that.  In this game, I'd like to use verbs a little more often instead of trying to encompass everything in a command. \n\nI would like to 'look at' the children/game and get a description that explains that they are playing a game of some sort, but I also want a more detailed description of the game (which is important to my game) when the player observes or watches the children/game more closely.\n\nThanks!",
