WHY?!\n\nD: More &quot;If&quot; capabilities. Sometimes Quest just does not have what i need.\n\nE: More Features. Oh common this is great but its missing ALOT. Ive used a free text editor and it more stuff than this yet it sucked so hard...\n\nF: Improved Sophistication. As in, WHY IS QUEST SO FREAKING STUPID AT TIMES??? Why doesn't it run scripts with no problem?!\n\nG: QuestNet and Quest. WTF? WHATS THE DIFFERENCE? I played online mode with both games i made! Single AND Online. \n\nIve gone too far..point is, there so much to improve on right now! QDK and Quest is cool right but seriously. Alex, I think you can do better job, no offence.
