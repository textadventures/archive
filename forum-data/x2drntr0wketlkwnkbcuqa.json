The normal feature of pinching or spreading to zoom in and out does not work. The text is a bit small, which I can increase. But after a text box pops up to enter the players name, it stayed zoomed in to where the user has to scroll around to read all the text.\r\n\r\nI am not sure where the settings are or where I can code in these commands.  Thanks in advanced for any help or suggestions",
