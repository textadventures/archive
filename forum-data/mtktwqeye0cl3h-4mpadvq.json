I got directed to an XSS error, basically, I use the NoScript add-on for Firefox, so I can block any scripts that might cause problems like slow downs, or well scripts that might bring viruses along with them.\r\nI decided to give this site a pass, thinking you couldn't possibly have anything bad attached to your downloads, so I disabled NoScript(because it never lets me bypass it when it blocks XSS problems).\r\nSo I downloaded the Quest update after that just fine. But, right after installed it, Windows Defender immediately reacted and said I had the virus Trojan:Win32/Rundas.B. \r\n\r\nOf course, I don't know exactly if the virus came from the Quest download, but considering Windows Defender pop-up the detection message right as soon as I finished the install, I thought I'd let you all know, so you all could check the download file for Quest you guys put up on this site. Finally, I'll add that this was the first and only site I visited today, so thought it could have come from here.",
