The problem is that apparently the \"and\" operation isn't defined to find out if the player has two specific objects. I've tried using the \"and\" operation to detect if the player is carrying the objects in their inventory and using the operation to detect if both items have the \"carried\" object flag, a flag only set if the player picks up the objects. But both methods return an error message stating that the \"and\" operation isn't defined for types \"Element\" and \"Element\".\r\n\r\nHere's the coding setup I have.\r\n```\r\nif (GetBoolean(photograph and map, \"carried\")) {\r\n  firsttime {\r\n    ClearScreen\r\n    PrintCentered (Yadda yadda yadda yadda)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAm I using the wrong operation entirely? Am I just using the \"and\" operation wrong?",
