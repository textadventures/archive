      "EditableText": "Hi,\n\nIs there an easy way to change a room's description after a player interacts with something?\nFor example, I want a player to look at an object, and the current room's description (or perhaps another room's description) will change.\nI also probably want a way to keep track of when a room's description has been modified, but I guess I could do that with flags.\nIn any case, I've tried using the &quot;modify room property description&quot; option, but it doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nI have managed to change room descriptions by setting the room description as a variable, defined by a function. \nBut if I do that the room no longer displays objects, the exit, or the room name in red, etc. How can I preserve these things while changing the room desc?\n\nThanks!",

Only use the if not the else and list them from least likely to occur to most likely (Quest runs the list from top to bottom until it finds something that fits the criteria...once it does it stops).\n\nThe other thing I do is make several differant &quot;Same&quot; rooms.  I had 7 &quot;Mossy Caves&quot; once.  The player does not know and you just use a script to move everything from one room to another when you change the exits.  This makes it easier to juggle complicated scernerios and also covers the problem of the player droping something in the room.\n\nGood luck and hope that helps.",
