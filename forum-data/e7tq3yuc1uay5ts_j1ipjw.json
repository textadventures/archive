      "EditableText": "Hello! So two things!\r\n\r\n1). So I've been in contact with Mr.Angel for a while about updating the Save/Load Library for my game, which is a save system that allows players to pick up where they left off from one update to another (which the default quest save simply cannot do). Unfortunately, it's been about...5-6 months with little to no progress (I've been trying to convince him to work on it so I can pay him but I'm not sure he's interested in something long term). The Save/Load Library was created by the Pixie about two or three years ago (?) and is in desperate need for an intuitive update.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm pretty desperate for this thing to get upgraded/completed/remastered and wouldn't mind shelling out some money at someone to work on and finish it. I'm not rich or anything but I would be happy to negotiate prices etc. The programming for the library is just beyond my capabilities atm. \r\n\r\n2). As a separate job, I would like either this same programmer or someone else interested to be a...fine-tooth comb programmer (long-term). Someone to go through my game (100,000 lines of code+almost 2,000,000 words) and clean up things that aren't needed or fix errors that I myself cannot fix.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anyone is interested! ^_^\r\n\r\nAnonynn\r\n\r\nEMAIL: anonymousynn@gmail.com\r\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/anonynn  (if you wanted to check the project out).
