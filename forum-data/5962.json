Figured using a turn script would work\n\nIn the main game directory i put the various scripted warnings as the creature got closer, every ten steps or so... when it catches them though and drags them back i get a strange doubling of the final message, and it seems to go on to even actions scripted to go on with the room. I initially thought it might be some script on entering the room, found none, changed the room as a test, still had the doubled messages after using the turn script to move them\n\nThe strange thing is that none of the other turn script messages get doubled during the chase.\n\nany suggestions",

It's happened to me a couple times.\n\nIf you are comfortable messing with code, view the game code (little notecard looking button at the top of the editor).  Hit 'Ctrl' + 'F' and type the exact room description in there.  Then enter.  If you find a bugaboo in there you can at least identify where in the editor you might find it.  I would not suggest trying to change anything in code view, however, unless you are 100% sure you know what you're doing.\n\nAlso, try and change the room description only to '12345' and see if that prints twice.\n\nAlso, look in the room attributes and see if you see the room message in there that's different than your 12345.\n\nJust some thoughts.  Let us know!",
