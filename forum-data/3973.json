      "EditableText": "I have not translated a game myself, but from what I know of the language variants in Quest, you'd have to have two separate games if you want to use the language scheme in Quest. For example, at the top of a game file is typically an include for &quot;English.aslx&quot;, which could be changed to Deutsch.aslx. But it's a compile time thing.\n\nI threw in the qualifier &quot;if you want to use the language scheme in Quest&quot; because you could always roll your own language switching scheme. I'm not sure what that would entail, but it would probably require touching all the places that use a template and making it select based on language (somehow).
