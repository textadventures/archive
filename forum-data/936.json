The Save King's Quest IX campaign has been a success!\n\nFor more information, you can visit:\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.kqix.com\">http://www.kqix.com</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.savekqix.org\">http://www.savekqix.org</a><!-- m -->\n\nI want to thank everyone who participated in the campaign.  It is only because of your support that we were able to save the game.\n\nTo those of you who posted things like \"this will never work\" or \"you are wasting your time\" in this or other forums around the net, it is with great pleasure that I say this: YOU WERE WRONG.  I don't say that to gloat.  I say it to get your attention, and to make a point.  The point is this: don't underestimate what people can do if they rally together for a cause they believe in.  If you assume from the beginning that you can not change something, and you don't try, then you will definitely not be able to change it.  But if you realize that it IS possible, and you DO try, then you DO have a chance at changing it.  I hope everyone takes that to heart.\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone who sent letters and emails to Vivendi, as well as everyone that blogged about the campaign or otherwise helped to spread the word.  Feel free to help spread the word about this wonderful piece of news.\n\nLast but certainly not least, I want to thank Vivendi for listening to the fans and allowing the game to continue.
