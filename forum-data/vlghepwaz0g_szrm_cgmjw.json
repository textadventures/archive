So it tells you that there isn't a ToInt function that accepts an Int32 parameter. I assume these are things the player typed in, but you already used ToInt to convert them. If you hadn't, you wouldn't be able to add them together.\r\n\r\nMost of the built in (hard coded) functions work like this - the function only accepts a particular type of parameter, and it will complain if you try to run it on something of a different type.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is just to remove the ToInt, and just do:\r\n```\r\nif (player.Luck + player.Str + player.Agi + player.Charm >= 50) {\r\n```",
