      "EditableText": "Do you mean that you want a new animal object to be created every 30 seconds?\n\nIf so, probably the best way to do this would be to create one &quot;animal&quot; object in QDK in a hidden room. Then, in your timer script, use the &quot;Clone an object&quot; command from the &quot;Modify&quot; category to create a new animal object. You'll need to increment a numeric variable to give each animal a new number at the end of its name.\n\nSo if your numeric variable is called &quot;animalcount&quot;, increment the variable, then for &quot;New Object Name&quot; enter &quot;animal%animalcount%&quot;.",
