So I closed and reopened the editor, and now I get an error every time I try to access that object and the whole editor refreshes. I can't undo, I cant delete it, I can't continue development. \r\n\r\nI can PROBABLY work around it by making a similarly named object and using that (assuming it too doesn't die), but the tiny perfectionist part of my brain wouldn't cope too well with that option.\r\n\r\nCan I raise an issue somewhere? Is there another way to remove/fix/edit it without using the main editor?\r\n\r\nThe error is \"Sorry, an internal error occurred.\"\r\n\r\nThanks",
