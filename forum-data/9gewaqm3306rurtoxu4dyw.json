It’s easy to get trapped there and to focus on the trivial aspects of our lives and avoid that with carries our greatest pain and triumphs. This is why the journey forward is needed now more than ever before. Unfortunately, these memories aren’t enough. Gender? Wealth? Heritage? Not all of these qualities define who we become.

define who we are deep down inside, they are struggles and goals that teach us the absolute hardest lesson and require the sum of all our wisdom to overcome. All for the sake of finding a missing piece of ourselves. If fire represents a gateway and the distant echoes fragments of time long spent, then the walls of the future are our struggles; barriers that must be painfully shattered so that we may reach the greatest truth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is more to it than that however, the future is also about survival, fortitude and perseverance. And they are needed more than ever. The Planet is dying and our continent, Auvora, is all that remains. At least that’s what some believe. The Void, the manifestation of corruption, lust and darkness has corroded the sea, perverted the land and it’s inhabitants, and now it has brought death to our doorstep. We all stand deep in the hurricane’s eye; one breath in wait as our warriors, knights, wizards and ancient protectors give their lives to hold this terrible evil at bay. \")\n      wait {\n        ClearScreen\n        msg (\"&lt;br/&gt;But now the tide has begun to recede and the hour of hopeful wishing has turned dim and despairing. The death stroke to finish us all might have finally been dealt---The Savior, the Muse’s special chosen, the only one who can truly fight back the Void has disappeared from the front. Taking with her our freedom and our futures. At first, this mere whisper only affected the paranoid and the doomsayers but when the whispers of a terrible omen circulated into the mix, even long established businessmen, religious leaders and traders began to flee their homes; each wanting to get as far from the Void and the fighting as possible. As a result, once thriving villages of commerce and trade became abandoned remnants of family dynasties, and ancient traditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s what happened here.

So the code isn't the neatest or the most efficient (and I haven't tested it after the last changes - if you want to actually use it, I can try poking it further).\r\n[Edit2: Slight edit, so \"allrandom\" will work with special cases like 'Alias']\r\n[Edit: Adding \"all random\" and \"debug\" options]\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Code and rationale</summary>\r\nI've got a big 'switch' statement that puts the text into some variables; followed by a big block of script that adds HTML for formatting, displays the question, processes the result, and sets up the next question. I find that in a lot of cases this can be better, as you're not looking through all the code every time you go to correct a typo or something.\r\n\r\nHaving them next to each other also makes it easier to notice if the information displayed in the message to the player (\"+3 Mood; Sexy/+3 Mood; Sarcastic\") and the change in the actual code (\"player.sexy = 5\", \"player.sarcasm = 5\") don't match. I noticed a couple of these while I was playing with this, I think I flagged them all with comments if you want to find them. Not sure if they're typos, or intentional UIscrew, so I didn't change them.\r\n\r\nReduction in code size is somewhere between 65% and 84%, depending if you count words, lines, or bytes.\r\n\r\nI also moves HTML to the end as far as possible; because I'm used to code-view in the web editor occasionally failing to save if you have too many `<` or `>` in strings.\r\n\r\nI've split it up into two functions, to reduce code reuse. Pseudo-XML to format them.\r\n```\r\n<function name=\"CharacterCreation1\">\r\n  if (GetBoolean (game, \"ccdebug)) {\r\n    msg (\"DEBUG: ClearScreen skipped so you can see previous debug output\")\r\n  }\r\n  else if (GetBoolean (game, \"ccrandom\")) {\r\n    // In the case of all stats random, you probably want to be able to scroll back and see what choices the randomiser made\r\n    // so we draw a line across the page instead of clearing the screen.\r\n    msg (\"<hr />\")\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    ClearScreen\r\n  }\r\n  if (not HasAttribute(game, \"ccreation\")) {\r\n    game.ccreation = \"stats mode\"\r\n  }\r\n  title = \"\"\r\n  question = \"\"\r\n  nextquestion = \"\"\r\n  afterquestion = null\r\n  options = NewStringDictionary()\r\n  simplechoice = false\r\n  addrandom = true\r\n  title = game.ccreation\r\n  // ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// //\r\n  //  To change the questions or the results, you should only need to edit  //\r\n  //                       this 'switch' statement :)                       //\r\n  // ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// //\r\n  switch (game.ccreation) {\r\n    case (\"stats mode\") {\r\n      title = \"\"\r\n      question = \"How would you like to create your character?\"\r\n      dictionary add (options, \"No stats.

Any scripts you put here will be executed before the question is asked. Setting the following variables will control the question displayed to the player:\r\n\r\n* `nextquestion = \"Some Question\"` - the value which will be put in `game.ccreation` for next time; which 'case' statement to do after this one. If this is omitted, the function will return without running again. If you're changing it within an `afterquestion` or if you have a `wait` block, you should change `game.ccreation` directly instead\r\n* `afterquestion => { some code goes here }` - this code will be executed after the player answers the question (if there is one - if there's only one option, the ShowMenu will be replaced by a `wait`, and then this script will run\r\n* `addrandom = false` - by default, a \"Random\" option will be added to the menu. This stops it.\r\n* `simplechoice = true` - if this is set, the menu will display the options (for example \"Boy\", \"Girl\", etc). If not, it will display the options, followed by a menu with \"Choice 1\", \"Choice 2\", and so on.\r\n* `question = \"What is your favourite food?\"` - The question which will be displayed to the user. In this question, you can use `///` for a paragraph break, and `[[some text here]]` to display text only if `game.stats` is true.\r\n* `title = \"Personal Skills\"` - The title will be displayed before the question, underlined. By default it is the same as the `game.ccreation` value, the name of the 'case'. Set it to `\"\"` if you don't want a title.\r\n* `dictionary add (options, \"Some option text here\", \"attribute=value\")` - Adds an option to the menu for this question. The option text is what the player will see, and may contain `[[stats text]]` as mentioned before. The result of this option being chosen is shown as `attribute=value` here.\r\n  * It can be `object.attribute=value` to set an attribute, or `attribute+value` or `attribute-value` to add or subtract from an attribute.\r\n  * If the object isn't specified, the player will be assumed.\r\n  * If the value starts with a `{`, it will be run through the text processor first, so you can use `{random:A:B:C}` or similar.\r\n    * After doing this, a spare `{` at the beginning will be removed, so you can put an extra `{` at the beginning to let the menu know the value contains text processor directives later on\r\n  * If you want the value to be a string like `{something}`, or to the strings `true`, `false`, or `123` without them being converted to numbers/booleans, put a single `'` before it\r\n  * If you want to set multiple attributes from the same menu choice, use `attribute1=value1;attribute2=value2`\r\n  * If you have `:Some text here` instead of an `attribute=value`, then \"Some text here\" will be displayed to the player\r\n</details>",

in the `switch` block defines a question that could be asked. Any scripts you put here will be executed before the question is asked. Setting the following variables will control the question displayed to the player:\n<ul>\n<li><code>nextquestion = \"Some Question\"</code> - the value which will be put in <code>game.ccreation</code> for next time; which 'case' statement to do after this one. If this is omitted, the function will return without running again. If you're changing it within an <code>afterquestion</code> or if you have a <code>wait</code> block, you should change <code>game.ccreation</code> directly instead</li>\n<li><code>afterquestion =&gt; { some code goes here }</code> - this code will be executed after the player answers the question (if there is one - if there's only one option, the ShowMenu will be replaced by a <code>wait</code>, and then this script will run</li>\n<li><code>addrandom = false</code> - by default, a \"Random\" option will be added to the menu. This stops it.</li>\n<li><code>simplechoice = true</code> - if this is set, the menu will display the options (for example \"Boy\", \"Girl\", etc). If not, it will display the options, followed by a menu with \"Choice 1\", \"Choice 2\", and so on.</li>\n<li><code>question = \"What is your favourite food?\"</code> - The question which will be displayed to the user. In this question, you can use <code>///</code> for a paragraph break, and <code>[[some text here]]</code> to display text only if <code>game.stats</code> is true.</li>\n<li><code>title = \"Personal Skills\"</code> - The title will be displayed before the question, underlined. By default it is the same as the <code>game.ccreation</code> value, the name of the 'case'. Set it to <code>\"\"</code> if you don't want a title.</li>\n<li><code>dictionary add (options, \"Some option text here\", \"attribute=value\")</code> - Adds an option to the menu for this question. The option text is what the player will see, and may contain <code>[[stats text]]</code> as mentioned before. The result of this option being chosen is shown as <code>attribute=value</code> here.\n<ul>\n<li>It can be <code>object.attribute=value</code> to set an attribute, or <code>attribute+value</code> or <code>attribute-value</code> to add or subtract from an attribute.</li>\n<li>If the object isn't specified, the player will be assumed.</li>\n<li>If the value starts with a <code>{</code>, it will be run through the text processor first, so you can use <code>{random:A:B:C}</code> or similar.\n<ul>\n<li>After doing this, a spare <code>{</code> at the beginning will be removed, so you can put an extra <code>{</code> at the beginning to let the menu know the value contains text processor directives later on</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you want the value to be a string like <code>{something}</code>, or to the strings <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, or <code>123</code> without them being converted to numbers/booleans, put a single <code>'</code> before it</li>\n<li>If you want to set multiple attributes from the same menu choice, use <code>attribute1=value1;attribute2=value2</code></li>\n<li>If you have <code>:Some text here</code> instead of an <code>attribute=value</code>, then \"Some text here\" will be displayed to the player</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n\n",
