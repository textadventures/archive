I really like this tool yet, since I like to write, and have some knowledge on computer science, so I think I will be able to make full use of Squiffy!\r\n\r\nI start using Squiffy with the windows app, but now I use the comand line version, because I want to have more control over the result.\r\n\r\nI have been able to override *index.template.html*, in particular to translate the restart button in french. \r\n\r\nNow, I need to translate the alert text that appear when we click on the restart link. So I have done like I have done for the *index.template.html file*, I copied the squiffy.template.js from the *...\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\squiffy* folder to my local project folder. I translated the alert text, but it make no change when I publish my project using the squiffy  command.\r\n\r\nI wonder how to do it. Does I have to fork the project and make the change I want on my fork ? I would prefer not, because the change I want to do will not be necessarely for all my projects.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance :)",
