Thanks!_\r\n\r\nHi! Haven't been on the forums in the while, a while back I made a post about creating wait times in a gamebook, because there didn't really seem to be a simple solution. Everyone was really helpful, and this is eventually what I was presented with!:\r\n\r\n```\r\neval (\"setTimeout(function(){addText(\\\"<span style='color:Black;font-family:Arial;font-size: 12px'>Hello world!</span>\\\")}, 1000);\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis printed text in a particular size (12px), font (Arial), and colour (Black), after 1000ms (1 second). It worked really well, exactly how I wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\neval (\"setTimeout(function(){ASLEvent(\\\"PrintDelayedLink1\\\", \\\"Page2\\\")}, 1000);\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would print a page link (Page2) after 1000ms. It went along with a Function that looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<function name=\"PrintDelayedLink1\" parameters=\"link\">\r\nmsg (\"{page:\"+link+\":{color:Black:Click here!}}\")\r\n</function>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was the function, the text of the link would be \"Click here!\" and the colour, obviously, black. This also worked properly.\r\n\r\nI then decided to experiment by creating a typewriter effect to print text. It's already available within a gamebook and very easy to implement normally, but as an ASLEvent I ran into some problems.\r\n\r\nThis is what I used:\r\n\r\n```\r\neval (\"setTimeout(function(){ASLEvent(\\\"Typewriter1\\\"Hello \\\"100\\\")}, 3000);\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlong with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<function name=\"Typewriter1\">\r\n    TextFX_Typewriter (\"Typewriter text.\", 100)\r\n  </function>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing happens when I run this. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
