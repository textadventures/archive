Is there any way how to make pop ups \"closable\" by other means than clicking on them?\r\n\r\nI am using popups a lot as a kind of glossary, to explain words that player may not be familiar with, but it would be great if it was possible to close it by... maybe clicking the word again, or pressing any keyboard/mouse button, or clicking anywhere else in the gamebook window.\r\n\r\nRight now player has to click the popup window itself to get rid of it. Is this the only way how to do it?\r\n\r\n",
