      "EditableText": "@ Gadaeus:\r\n\r\nhere's a step by step (along with explanation) guide of the basics of everything you need / are asking help for/on\r\n\r\nfirst (most of my post) I get into: quest, quest's structure, quest's code structure\r\n\r\nthen, I get into basic coding: scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script, briefly... ( see this link for much more detailed help/info: https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk )\r\n\r\nlastly, at the bottom, I get into dialogue/conversation, via a simple menu design\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\ndialogue/conversation is very complex, even for/with doing the simplest method for it\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nwhile you can use the GUI/Editor to do anything/everything (as quest is very powerful), with no coding knowledge, you can only make the most rudimentary of games, even with using the GUI/Editor. You need to know the basics of coding (scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script usage), even if you're only working with the GUI/Editor (no code) as you still got to understand the concept and logic involved for/in doing what you want, as this opens up 90% of everything you want to do in your game, a huge bang for the buck. Whereas, after learning basic coding (scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script usage), learning even more coding stuff has very diminishing returns (as remember you're already at 90% just from basic coding: scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI'll walk you through the simplest way to do it, using the GUI/Editor (but along with coding too):\r\n\r\ncreate a new game, click on the 'create a Text Adventure' circle button, to create a Text Adventure game, name it whatever you want (quest will automatically add on its extension to it: YOUR_NAME_OF_FILE.aslx) and save it to the desktop (so you can find it easily).\r\n\r\nin the GUI/Editor, on the left side of the screen, is the \"tree of stuff\", which looks like this for a new game:\r\n\r\n```\r\nObjects\r\n-> game\r\n->-> verbs\r\n->-> Commands\r\n-> room\r\n->-> player\r\nFunctions\r\nTimers\r\nWalkthrough\r\nAdvanced\r\n-> Included Libraries\r\n->-> English.aslx\r\n->-> Core.aslx\r\n-> Templates\r\n-> Dynamic Templates\r\n-> Object Types\r\n-> JavaScript\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis \"tree of stuff\" are all of the \"physical things\" (and in code: they're the tag blocks/lines) in/of your game: http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\r\n\r\nclick on something in the \"tree of stuff\", so it is highlighted, and then on the right side, you'll see more options/controls/details for that thing that you've got highlighted.\r\n\r\nfor example, click on 'game' in the\" tree of stuff\" so it is highlighted, and now on the right side, you got Tabs at the top:\r\n\r\nSetup, Features, Display, Interface, Script, Room Descriptions, Player, Attributes\r\n\r\nclick on these Tabs, and see what various options/controls/details they provide you with\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nnow, let's delve into the code: your entire game code\r\n\r\nat the very top of the screen in the menu bar, between the 'play' and '? (help)' buttons, is a notepaper-like button, which is a toggle to switch between the GUI/Editor mode and the Code View mode (this is your entire game code), so click on it, to see your entire game code, which for a new game, looks like this roughly (I'm not using the most current quest version, so there might be some differences):\r\n\r\n(to see/get-at your entire game code, you can always simply right-click on your game file itself, in this example, saved on your desktop, and open it up with a text editor software: notepad, wordpad, Apple: text editor, notepad++, etc)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_new_game\">\r\n\r\n    <gameid>SOME_RANDOMLY_GENERATED_HASH_STRING</gameid>\r\n    <version>1.0</version>\r\n    <firstpublished>2017</firstpublished>\r\n\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"room\">\r\n\r\n    <inherit name=\"editor_room\" />\r\n\r\n    <object name=\"player\">\r\n\r\n      <inherit name=\"editor_object\" />\r\n      <inherit name=\"editor_player\" />\r\n\r\n    </object>\r\n\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n// start (starting code line) of the 'asl' tag block: (see line below)\r\n<asl version=\"XXX\">\r\n  // mass of code (your entire game's contents)\r\n</asl>\r\n// end (ending code line) of the 'asl' tag block: (see line above)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is the 'asl' tag block, which IS your game, the 'asl' tag block IS YOUR GAME OBJECT, so everything must be within this 'asl' tag block!\r\n\r\nthe starting line of a tag block (or a single tag line) is known as the 'signature/header', which has special parameters in it, such as with the 'asl' tag block's: version=\"XXX\"\r\n\r\nthis (version=\"XXX\") MUST MATCH UP with the quest engine (quest download) version you're using:\r\n\r\nin the GUI/Editor, at the top of the screen, in the menu bar at the top (File, Edit, Tools, Help), click on 'Help -> About', to see the quest engine version you're using (have installed), which for me, looks partially like this:\r\n\r\nQuest: 5.6\r\nBuild: 5.6.5514.32136\r\n\r\nonly the first two digits matter for the: version=\"XXX\", the third digit is always a zero, so for me, I have to have this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"560\">\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou'll probably have '560' or '570' or '580', whatever the current version of quest is...\r\n\r\nif you've got/see: version=\"550\", even though you're using the most current version of quest (v560, v570, v580, whatever), don't worry, as this just means that the current version of quest, still uses the v550 engine.\r\n\r\nI lied up above (as I didn't want to initially confuse you), as it shows this for me: version=\"550\", as this still works with the v560 engine I'm using.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthese are the default libraries (for english language downloads), which actually contain the quest engine coding itself... yes, if you're good at coding and know quest, you can create your own unique quest engine!\r\n\r\n'libraries' are just 'library files', which merely contain code, that can be used by your game file.\r\n\r\nhere's how to create a library file:\r\n\r\ncreate a new notepad doc for example, and write this into it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<library>\r\n  // mass of code\r\n</library>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand simply save it (and to the desktop, so you can find it easily) with the same extension of: NAME_OF_LIBRARY_FILE.aslx\r\n\r\n(make sure the extension is 'XXX.aslx', if it's 'XXX.txt', just change it to 'XXX.aslx')\r\n\r\na library file can be as simple as a single Object for your game, for example, a 'dragon' Object:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<library>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"dragon\">\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</library>\r\n```\r\n\r\nor an entire engine... or a different human language (english, spanish, russian, chinese, german, etc)...\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nyour game is \"built-up\" (initialized), first from the library files (so their heirarchy of, top:first to bottom:last, matters!), and then lastly from your game file's own code/content\r\n\r\nfor example, if you had this (switching the default libraries ordering, see below), you'll probably get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nanyways...\r\n\r\nto add a library file to our game (if you've not connected it already):\r\n\r\n1. the library file itself must be in the same folder/location as your game file, so that the game file can find (and thus use) it\r\n2. you must add it via code within your game file (see below)\r\n\r\nlet's say we created a 'dragon.aslx' library file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<library>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"dragon\">\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</library>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand to add it into our 'example_game.aslx' game file via code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"dragon.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_game\">\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich, is the exact same thing as if we just did this:\r\n\r\n'example_game.aslx' game file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_game\">\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"dragon\">\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nso, you don't have to use library files, but they can be greatly helpful, just for organization of code alone.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nthe game file has some required code stuff in order for it to work as a game file, but otherwise, there's no difference between a library file and a game file, both just hold code.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nanyways... onwards...\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_game\">\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe 'game' tag block is what you see as the 'game' in the \"tree of stuff\" in the GUI/Editor, they're the same thing\r\n\r\nthis is a special (and required) Object, which has various controls/toggles/options/attributes for game-wide settings and also has outside of game (publishing) info for people looking in whether to play your game or not (author, description, version: version/update history, first published, category, etc etc etc), and some other special game stuff ('pov', the 'start' script, etc)\r\n\r\nyou can see this for yourself, go back into GUI/Editor mode, and name/re-name your game, then go into Code View (entire game code: remember at the top of the screen, in the menu bar, click on the notepaper like button), and see the change to the special 'game' Game Settings Object:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"THE_NAME/RE-NAME_OCCURS_HERE\">\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow, try \"coding\" (writing) in a different name into the code (see above), and then go back into the GUI/Editor mode, and look at see what it says is the game name.\r\n\r\nsee/test the same thing (Code View vs GUI/Editor) with the other options/controls/attributes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"THE_NAME/RE-NAME_OCCURS_HERE\">\r\n\r\n    <gameid>SOME_RANDOMLY_GENERATED_HASH_STRING</gameid>\r\n    <version>1.0</version>\r\n    <firstpublished>2017</firstpublished>\r\n\r\n    <author>HegemonKhan</author>\r\n    <category>RPG</category>\r\n    <subtitle>THIS_IS_MY_SUBTITLE_FOR_MY_GAME</subtitle>\r\n    <description>This is my example game</description>\r\n\r\n    // etc etc etc Attributes/options/controls\r\n\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\non wards...\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_game\">\r\n    // blah Attributes\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"room\">\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe 'room' Room Object is the default Room Object, containing the default 'player' Player Object (not shown above)\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nand lastly...\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_game\">\r\n    // blah Attributes\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"room\">\r\n\r\n    <object name=\"player\">\r\n    </object>\r\n\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is the default 'player' Player Object, contained (\"nested/indented\") within the default 'room' Room Object\r\n\r\nthe built-in 'parent' Object (reference/pointer) Attribute is what actually determines containment, so the below, is the same as the above:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_game\">\r\n    // blah Attributes\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"room\">\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"player\">\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"parent\" type=\"object\">room</attr>\r\n\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nanyways...\r\n\r\nthe containment/parent-child heirarchy is the same as if they were folders:\r\n\r\n'asl' (the GAME OBJECT) \"folder/block\"\r\n-> 'include ref' (libraries) \"line\"\r\n-> 'delegate name' (delegates) \"line\"\r\n-> 'game' (the special GAME SETTINGS Object) \"folder/block\"\r\n-> etc stuff (Objects, Exits, Functions, Commands, Verbs, Timers, Turnscripts, Object Types, etc) \"folder/block/line\"\r\n\r\nso, the vertical placement doesn't matter, after (below) the special 'game' Game Settings Object (\"folder\"/block)\r\n\r\nhowever, horizontal placement (indenting/\"nesting\") matters BIG TIME!\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nanyways... onto...\r\n\r\nbasic coding: scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script\r\n\r\nAttributes ('Attribute' VARIABLES):\r\n\r\nin the GUI/Editor: 'WHATEVER' Object -> 'Attributes' Tab -> Attributes -> Add (repeat as needed) -> (set it/them up: name of attribute, type, value)\r\n\r\nin code, an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_game\">\r\n    // blah Attributes\r\n  </game>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"room\">\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"player\">\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"parent\" type=\"object\">room</attr>\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"alias\" type=\"string\">HK</attr>\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"strength\" type=\"int\">100</attr>\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"flying\" type=\"boolean\">false</attr>\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"weapon\" type=\"object\">katana</attr>\r\n\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n  <object name=\"katana\">\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"damage\" type=\"double\">67.345</attr>\r\n\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nwe take this stuff for granted/naturally/instinctively, but in programming, it must be expressed/used/handled, unfortunately:\r\n\r\nData (Data/Attribute/Variable/Value) Types: http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/types/\r\n\r\n(Attribute/Variable Type and Value Type, must match up!)\r\n\r\nthis is for when you're doing any scripting (if done with the GUI/Editor, it handles this stuff for you) :\r\n\r\nint (integers): a non-decimal number: -999, -3, 0, 7, 647\r\n\r\nexample: player.strength = 100\r\n\r\ndoubles (floats / floating-points): decimal numbers: -999.9, -3.12345, 0.0, 1.99, 777.4\r\n\r\nexample: player.damage = 47.3\r\n\r\nbooleans (only two special value choices/states, NO double quotes!): false, true\r\n\r\nexample: orc.dead = false\r\n\r\nstring values (\"text\": alphabet characters/symbols, numbers/\"numeric\" characters/symbols, and some other symbols/characters): \"a\", \"abc\", \"1\", \"123\", \"abc123\", \"hi\", \"strength\", \"dead\", \"abc_123_abc_123\", \"Welcome to my game, I hope you enjoy it, muwhaha!\", \"true\", \"false\", \"player\", \"room\", \"HK\", \"orc\", \"dragon\", etc etc etc. Note the double quotes, they're required!\r\n\r\nexample: player.alias = \"HK\"\r\n\r\nobject (reference/pointer) values (these must be actually existing/created Objects, do NOT have double quotes!): player, room, HK, orc, dragon, etc etc etc. EXCEPT (as these are reserved/special for a boolean's values): true, false\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\ncreate (\"katana\") // just to show/have an actually existing/created 'katana', as this is required for an Object (reference/pointer) Attribute\r\nplayer.weapon = katana\r\n\r\nlists, dictionaries... we'll get into lists slightly... in a bit (involved with menus)... but lists and dictionaries are more advanced stuff, so won't get into them within this post (aside from basic usage of lists for menus)\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nanyways... I'm getting tired... so let me wrap this up...\r\n\r\nsimple dialogue/conversation example:\r\n\r\nvia (in) the GUI/Editor:\r\n\r\n'Objects' (\"tree of stuff\") -> 'Objects' Tab -> Add -> Name: npc_1\r\n\r\nusing the built-in 'speak/talk' Verb:\r\n\r\n'npc_1' (\"tree of stuff\") -> 'Attributes' Tab -> Attributes (the box at bottom, NOT the 'Inherited Types' box at the top) -> Add -> (see below)\r\n\r\nAttribute Name: topics_list\r\n\r\nin the 'Attributes' box, make sure you got the 'topics_list' highlighted (click on it if it's not highlighted), then continue setting it up (see below)\r\n\r\n[String List] // this is the \"Attribute Type\" selection\r\n\r\nAdd (this is adding values, known as \"items\", to your string list. The values/\"items\" are string values/\"items\", as we made this as a String List Attribute Type, and thus it needs to have double quotes if done in code, but the GUI/Editor handles it, so do NOT type in the double quotes when you're adding/naming the value/item to your list) -> princess\r\n\r\nAdd (this is adding values, known as \"items\", to your string list. The values/\"items\" are string values/\"items\", as we made this as a String List Attribute Type, and thus it needs to have double quotes if done in code, but the GUI/Editor handles it, so do NOT type in the double quotes when you're adding/naming the value/item to your list) -> dragon\r\n\r\nAdd (this is adding values, known as \"items\", to your string list.

Sometimes I like using the 'if' Script and sometimes I like using the 'switch'Script, it depends on the situation and/or which I prefer using more)\r\n\r\n(the 'show a menu, get input, ask, etc?' Scripts, automatically, hidden from you, stores your selected/inputted choice into the built-in 'result' Variable VARIABLE: result = YOUR_SELECTED/INPUTTED_CHOICE)\r\n\r\nusing the 'if' Script:\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'scripts' section/category -> 'if' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nif [expression] result = \"princess\"\r\n\r\n-> then -> add new script -> 'output' section/category ->

be found in his dark spire...\r\n\r\n************\r\n\r\nhow the 'if' script works: string matching\r\n\r\nlet's say you selected 'dragon' as your choice from the list, so:\r\n\r\nresult = \"dragon\"\r\n\r\n// in code example/explanation:\r\nif (result = \"princess\") { /* scripting */ }\r\n// if (\"dragon\" = \"princess\")\r\n// if (\"d\" = \"p\") ---> FALSE\r\n// if (\"dragon\" = \"princess\") ---> FALSE\r\n// thus since 'FALSE', move to the next 'if/else-if/else' condition/test/check, which is: else if (result = \"dragon), see below:\r\nelse if (result = \"dragon\") { /* scripting */ }\r\n// if (\"dragon\" = \"dragon\")\r\n// if (\"d\" = \"d\") ---> TRUE\r\n// if (\"r\" = \"r\") ----> TRUE\r\n// if (\"a\" = \"a\") ----> TRUE\r\n// if (\"g\" = \"g\") ----> TRUE\r\n// if (\"o\" = \"o\") ----> TRUE\r\n// if (\"n\" = \"n\") ----> TRUE\r\n// if (\"dragon\" = \"dragon\") ----> TRUE\r\n// so do its scripting: outputs: The dragon can only be killed by the legendary dragon slayer sword!\r\n\r\n***************\r\n\r\nusing the 'switch' Script:\r\n\r\n(actually, I'm getting too tired/exhausted... lots of typing already...)\r\n\r\nsee if you can figure out the

      "HTML": "<p>@ Gadaeus:</p>\n<p>here's a step by step (along with explanation) guide of the basics of everything you need / are asking help for/on</p>\n<p>first (most of my post) I get into: quest, quest's structure, quest's code structure</p>\n<p>then, I get into basic coding: scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script, briefly... ( see this link for much more detailed help/info: https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk )</p>\n<p>lastly, at the bottom, I get into dialogue/conversation, via a simple menu design</p>\n<hr>\n<p>dialogue/conversation is very complex, even for/with doing the simplest method for it</p>\n<hr>\n<p>while you can use the GUI/Editor to do anything/everything (as quest is very powerful), with no coding knowledge, you can only make the most rudimentary of games, even with using the GUI/Editor. You need to know the basics of coding (scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script usage), even if you're only working with the GUI/Editor (no code) as you still got to understand the concept and logic involved for/in doing what you want, as this opens up 90% of everything you want to do in your game, a huge bang for the buck. Whereas, after learning basic coding (scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script usage), learning even more coding stuff has very diminishing returns (as remember you're already at 90% just from basic coding: scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'll walk you through the simplest way to do it, using the GUI/Editor (but along with coding too):</p>\n<p>create a new game, click on the 'create a Text Adventure' circle button, to create a Text Adventure game, name it whatever you want (quest will automatically add on its extension to it: YOUR_NAME_OF_FILE.aslx) and save it to the desktop (so you can find it easily).</p>\n<p>in the GUI/Editor, on the left side of the screen, is the \"tree of stuff\", which looks like this for a new game:</p>\n<pre><code>Objects\n-&gt; game\n-&gt;-&gt; verbs\n-&gt;-&gt; Commands\n-&gt; room\n-&gt;-&gt; player\nFunctions\nTimers\nWalkthrough\nAdvanced\n-&gt; Included Libraries\n-&gt;-&gt; English.aslx\n-&gt;-&gt; Core.aslx\n-&gt; Templates\n-&gt; Dynamic Templates\n-&gt; Object Types\n-&gt; JavaScript\n</code></pre>\n<p>this \"tree of stuff\" are all of the \"physical things\" (and in code: they're the tag blocks/lines) in/of your game: http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</p>\n<p>click on something in the \"tree of stuff\", so it is highlighted, and then on the right side, you'll see more options/controls/details for that thing that you've got highlighted.</p>\n<p>for example, click on 'game' in the\" tree of stuff\" so it is highlighted, and now on the right side, you got Tabs at the top:</p>\n<p>Setup, Features, Display, Interface, Script, Room Descriptions, Player, Attributes</p>\n<p>click on these Tabs, and see what various options/controls/details they provide you with</p>\n<hr>\n<p>now, let's delve into the code: your entire game code</p>\n<p>at the very top of the screen in the menu bar, between the 'play' and '? (help)' buttons, is a notepaper-like button, which is a toggle to switch between the GUI/Editor mode and the Code View mode (this is your entire game code), so click on it, to see your entire game code, which for a new game, looks like this roughly (I'm not using the most current quest version, so there might be some differences):</p>\n<p>(to see/get-at your entire game code, you can always simply right-click on your game file itself, in this example, saved on your desktop, and open it up with a text editor software: notepad, wordpad, Apple: text editor, notepad++, etc)</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;game name=\"example_new_game\"&gt;\n\n

'asl' tag block IS YOUR GAME OBJECT, so everything must be within this 'asl' tag block!</p>\n<p>the starting line of a tag block (or a single tag line) is known as the 'signature/header', which has special parameters in it, such as with the 'asl' tag block's: version=\"XXX\"</p>\n<p>this (version=\"XXX\") MUST MATCH UP with the quest engine (quest download) version you're using:</p>\n<p>in the GUI/Editor, at the top of the screen, in the menu bar at the top (File, Edit, Tools, Help), click on 'Help -&gt; About', to see the quest engine version you're using (have installed), which for me, looks partially like this:</p>\n<p>Quest: 5.6<br>\nBuild: 5.6.5514.32136</p>\n<p>only the first two digits matter for the: version=\"XXX\", the third digit is always a zero, so for me, I have to have this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"560\"&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>you'll probably have '560' or '570' or '580', whatever the current version of quest is...</p>\n<p>if you've got/see: version=\"550\", even though you're using the most current version of quest (v560, v570, v580, whatever), don't worry, as this just means that the current version of quest, still uses the v550 engine.</p>\n<p>I lied up above (as I didn't want to initially confuse you), as it shows this for me: version=\"550\", as this still works with the v560 engine I'm using.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>these are the default libraries (for english language downloads), which actually contain the quest engine coding itself... yes, if you're good at coding and know quest, you can create your own unique quest engine!</p>\n<p>'libraries' are just 'library files', which merely contain code, that can be used by your game file.</p>\n<p>here's how to create a library file:</p>\n<p>create a new notepad doc for example, and write this into it:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;library&gt;\n  // mass of code\n&lt;/library&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and simply save it (and to the desktop, so you can find it easily) with the same extension of: NAME_OF_LIBRARY_FILE.aslx</p>\n<p>(make sure the extension is 'XXX.aslx', if it's 'XXX.txt', just change it to 'XXX.aslx')</p>\n<p>a library file can be as simple as a single Object for your game, for example, a 'dragon' Object:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;library&gt;\n\n  &lt;object name=\"dragon\"&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;/library&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>or an entire engine... or a different human language (english, spanish, russian, chinese, german, etc)...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>your game is \"built-up\" (initialized), first from the library files (so their heirarchy of, top:first to bottom:last, matters!), and then lastly from your game file's own code/content</p>\n<p>for example, if you had this (switching the default libraries ordering, see below), you'll probably get an error:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<p>anyways...</p>\n<p>to add a library file to our game (if you've not connected it already):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the library file itself must be in the same folder/location as your game file, so that the game file can find (and thus use) it</li>\n<li>you must add it via code within your game file (see below)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>let's say we created a 'dragon.aslx' library file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;library&gt;\n\n  &lt;object name=\"dragon\"&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;/library&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and to add it into our 'example_game.aslx' game file via code:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"dragon.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;game name=\"example_game\"&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>which, is the exact same thing as if we just did this:</p>\n<p>'example_game.aslx' game file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;game name=\"example_game\"&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n\n  &lt;object name=\"dragon\"&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>so, you don't have to use library files, but they can be greatly helpful, just for organization of code alone.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>the game file has some required code stuff in order for it to work as a game file, but otherwise, there's no difference between a library file and a game file, both just hold code.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>anyways... onwards...</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;game name=\"example_game\"&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>the 'game' tag block is what you see as the 'game' in the \"tree of stuff\" in the GUI/Editor, they're the same thing</p>\n<p>this is a special (and required) Object, which has various controls/toggles/options/attributes for game-wide settings and also has outside of game (publishing) info for people looking in whether to play your game or not (author, description, version: version/update history, first published, category, etc etc etc), and some other special game stuff ('pov', the 'start' script, etc)</p>\n<p>you can see this for yourself, go back into GUI/Editor mode, and name/re-name your game, then go into Code View (entire game code: remember at the top of the screen, in the menu bar, click on the notepaper like button), and see the change to the special 'game' Game Settings Object:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;game name=\"THE_NAME/RE-NAME_OCCURS_HERE\"&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>now, try \"coding\" (writing) in a different name into the code (see above), and then go back into the GUI/Editor mode, and look at see what it says is the game name.</p>\n<p>see/test the same thing (Code View vs GUI/Editor) with the other options/controls/attributes:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;game name=\"THE_NAME/RE-NAME_OCCURS_HERE\"&gt;\n\n

'player' Player Object, contained (\"nested/indented\") within the default 'room' Room Object</p>\n<p>the built-in 'parent' Object (reference/pointer) Attribute is what actually determines containment, so the below, is the same as the above:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;game

matter, after (below) the special 'game' Game Settings Object (\"folder\"/block)</p>\n<p>however, horizontal placement (indenting/\"nesting\") matters BIG TIME!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>anyways...

-999.9, -3.12345, 0.0, 1.99, 777.4</p>\n<p>example: player.damage = 47.3</p>\n<p>booleans (only two special value choices/states, NO double quotes!): false, true</p>\n<p>example: orc.dead = false</p>\n<p>string values (\"text\": alphabet characters/symbols, numbers/\"numeric\" characters/symbols, and some other symbols/characters): \"a\", \"abc\", \"1\", \"123\", \"abc123\", \"hi\", \"strength\", \"dead\", \"abc_123_abc_123\", \"Welcome to my game, I hope you enjoy it, muwhaha!\", \"true\", \"false\", \"player\", \"room\", \"HK\", \"orc\", \"dragon\", etc etc etc. Note the double quotes, they're required!</p>\n<p>example: player.alias = \"HK\"</p>\n<p>object (reference/pointer) values (these must be actually existing/created Objects, do NOT have double quotes!): player, room, HK, orc, dragon, etc etc etc. EXCEPT (as these are reserved/special for a boolean's values): true, false</p>\n<p>example:</p>\n<p>create (\"katana\") // just to show/have an actually existing/created
