      "EditableText": "I'm trying to find a way to make it so using an object both changes a variable, and changes a property of the object.\n\nSay I had a box of ten pills. I would like using one pill to increase &quot;Health&quot; by 10 or 10% (is changing values by percentages possible?), and decrease the number of pills in the box by one. When the number of pills hits zero I would like the &quot;Box&quot; object to disappear.\n\nI'd also like to have an object that acts on &quot;Health&quot; in the opposite way. Say, a bottle with ten drops of poison in it. Use one drop and health decreases by 10 or 10%. \n\nIdeally I would like a different message to print depending on whether &quot;Health&quot; changes positively or negatively, or possibly a warning message if, say, &quot;Health&quot; drops below 50.\n\nIf it were at all possible, I'd love for the description of &quot;Health&quot; to change depending on its value - maybe 90 is &quot;Hale and Hearty&quot; and 30 is &quot;Sickly.&quot;\n\nIs any of this doable?",
