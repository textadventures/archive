Is there a way to make a room start with a number, for example 99 Park Street?  Maybe use the alt code for &quot;space&quot;?  Will this possibly cause bad things to happen with future updates?\n\n  Alternatively, I guess I can make the room name Park Street 99, and then make the alias 99 Park Street?  Is this the best route or is there something easier I can do?  Thanks in advance,\n\n~Dwellewd~",
