However I've noticed that the headers for the attribute and type boxes in the \"Attributes\" tabs on objects is clipping behind the boxes themselves, partially obscuring the text. I'm not sure if this is a glitch with the current version of Quest itself, or if this is due to my computer, but I felt pointing it out might be beneficial if anyone else is having this issue.\r\n\r\nFor clarity's sake, I'm running Windows 10 Pro on 3840 x 2160 resolution with a 300% scale. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this issue and have you found any solutions?",
