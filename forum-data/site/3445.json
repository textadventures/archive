I ask because I've been keeping a mailing list of the QuestComp entrants/judges in my yahoo account, but someone just joined up who does not have a public e-mail address listed in their user profile here. I'm going to ask them if I may have an e-mail address to use for that purpose, but in case they're not comfortable with that I wanted to pursue an alternative plan. I experimented with trying to e-mail myself, but didn't have any luck.",
