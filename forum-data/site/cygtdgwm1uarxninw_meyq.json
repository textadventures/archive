      "EditableText": "Hello, all!\r\n\r\nI've finally got the chance to teach a class in Quest, and tried to start the process today by registering with my school email and reserving a sub-site on ActiveLit. The registration generated an error. I tried again and it said the sub-site name was now taken, but I have not received an email with password information. I tried sending a few messages asking for help via the contact page, but THOSE also generated error messages. I hate to be sending so many requests for help, but I'm just not sure if any of them are getting through. \r\n\r\nIf I can get this working, I have two related questions:\r\n\r\n1) Has anyone experienced problems with using the \"login with Google\" option instead of the standard username/password option? I just want to make sure using \"login with Google\" won't create some weird problem when I start creating my virtual class space on ActiveLit.\r\n\r\n2) When you sign up for ActiveLit, you are asked to provide a site name (\"activelit/{yourlocation}\"). You can create multiple classrooms within this site, true? For example, I could have one site, but then WITHIN that have one classroom space for \"Spring 2021\", then another classroom space for \"Fall 2021\" and then a third for \"Spring 2022\"? Or do I need to have one site and then clean it out every time I have a new semester and a new class with new students?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\n-Doug\r\n",
