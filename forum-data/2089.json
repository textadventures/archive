It seems very few people were interested in making multi-player games, which is why I've removed QuestNet Server from Quest 4.1.\n\nHowever, Quest Pro users can still download Quest Pro 4.0.5, which includes QuestNet Server Pro 4.0.5, and if you find any bugs in this version I'll do my best to fix them.",
