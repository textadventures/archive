I have a verb that I put in all my characters (objets that are select like people), but I'd like to be able to use it only one time (if it's possible, only one time and only one character, but if it's not, only one time per character). Is there a way to do that? I'm a complete dummy with codes and stuff\r\n\r\nThanks",
