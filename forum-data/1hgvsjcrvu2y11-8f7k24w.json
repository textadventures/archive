      "EditableText": "Just wanted to put it out there. I submitted a crosstie to Crossover quite a bit ago, and now the tie file is on the Crossover website, officially approved after vetting. If you own Crossover (or possibly with a trial copy), you can get the TIE file from Crossover's website and it will install Quest and make games fully playable. Not for creating games, but just for gameplay. I'm also working to get a file on PortingKit's website that will install Quest through there...PortingKit is free, so a bit more accessible. Quest is not yet on the list within Crossover, but that may change with a future version. Crossover beta testers will beta-test Quest when a new beta of Crossover is out, and this may lead to Quest being available within Crossover itself. Good news for Mac users.",
