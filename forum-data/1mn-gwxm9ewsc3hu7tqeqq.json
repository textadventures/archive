I've set both objects to be use/give-able and selected on the given object \"give this to (other object)\" with the action \"handle objects individually\", and selected the object I want to give it to, with a script to print a message about it. I've also selected on the receiving object \"give (other object) to this\", but when I play the game, I don't get any button options to give the first object, and when I type \"give (object) to (object)\" I don't get any reply at all? Pls help! Ive been having so far but somehow this has me really stumped!",
