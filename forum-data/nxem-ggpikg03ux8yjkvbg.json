Where are you putting this script?\r\n\r\nIf you want to prevent objects being put into the torch, there's a few ways I could suggest.\r\n\r\n1. Make it a limited container. You said the battery can't be taken, so if you make it only large enough to contain 1 item, the player gets an \"It is full\" message.\r\n\r\n2. Use an addscript (script when the player tries to add an object) on the container. Then you can let the player remove the battery, but they can't put anything else in. Something like:\r\n```\r\nif (object = AABattery1) {\r\n  object.parent = this\r\n  msg (\"You put the battery back in.\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You can't close the battery cover with a non-battery in there.\")\r\n}\r\n```",
