I'd agree the slightly more advanced stuff gets tedious to do with far too many window changes.  That Quest is less popular than other systems is maybe in a small way attributable to the shortcomings of the GUI, but rather more to the fact it makes it too darn easy to generate something that 'works' but is basically dire as a game.\n\n[quote:39wiptje] with Tads/Inform, you have a huge amount of people willing to play your game; with Quest there are far, far fewer.

[/quote:39wiptje]\n\nI agree with this completely, though it's not directly related to the question(s) asked, it's a fair comment. Of course all Windows only systems are at a disadvantage in this respect to cross platform systems like Inform (an interpreter for which can probably be found pre-installed on your sandwich toaster...  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->  )\n\n[quote:39wiptje]\nYou're also pitting the GUI side of Quest against the likes of Tads and Inform. That's misleading. Doing something in the Quest GUI is certainly easier than coding in Tads and Inform.\n[/quote:39wiptje] \n\nWe agree that doing something in Quest's QDK is easier than writing code in TADS/Inform.  Given that our mythical beginner will opt for the easy route, 'pitting' QDK against writing Inform or TADS code is entirely reasonable and not a misleading comparison at all.  I've gone to great lengths to explain how this extra ease of use actually works [b:39wiptje]against[/b:39wiptje] Quest, because the Inform/TADS code writers have necessarily got to learn more to begin with and thus are very likely (almost certain in fact) to produce a superior product.  \n\nThe question was 'is Quest easy to use' - my answer (summarised) was yes it is, but be aware that a couple of hours of QDK is no substitute for learning to program, be it in TADS/Inform or even Quest's own ASL.  \n\n[quote:39wiptje]\nBut is doing something in the Quest GUI easier than it is in the Adrift GUI? No. \n[/quote:39wiptje]\n\nFrankly, I don't find the ADRIFT GUI any easier to use than the Quest one. They are different and no doubt each suits a different group of users, but I don't like either.  Adrift is unarguably the more popular choice by far though.  \n\n[quote:39wiptje]\nIs coding something in the source code for Quest easier than it is in the source code for Tads or Inform? No.\n[/quote:39wiptje]\n\nI have to disagree on this, I'd place Inform and TADS as being considerably harder to write code for than Quest. Quest ASL is visual basic like, while Inform and TADS are much more C/C++ like in syntax.\n\nThe unique thing with Quest is that it has BOTH possibilities, GUI or conventional coding and you can mix both in the same piece. \n\nAl (MaDbRiT)",

I'd agree the slightly more advanced stuff gets tedious to do with far too many window changes.  That Quest is less popular than other systems is maybe in a small way attributable to the shortcomings of the GUI, but rather more to the fact it makes it too darn easy to generate something that 'works' but is basically dire as a game.<br/><br/><blockquote><p> with Tads/Inform, you have a huge amount of people willing to play your game; with Quest there are far, far fewer. While that might not seem a reason in itself, no one writes games for their own amusement. They crave feedback. </p></blockquote><br/><br/>I agree with this completely, though it's not directly related to the question(s) asked, it's a fair comment. Of course all Windows only systems are at a disadvantage in this respect to cross platform systems like Inform (an interpreter for which can probably be found pre-installed on your sandwich toaster...  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->  )<br/><br/><blockquote><p><br/>You're also pitting the GUI side of Quest against the likes of Tads and Inform. That's misleading. Doing something in the Quest GUI is certainly easier than coding in Tads and Inform.<br/></p></blockquote> <br/><br/>We agree that doing something in Quest's QDK is easier than writing code in TADS/Inform.  Given that our mythical beginner will opt for the easy route, 'pitting' QDK against writing Inform or TADS code is entirely reasonable and not a misleading comparison at all.  I've gone to great lengths to explain how this extra ease of use actually works <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">against</span> Quest, because the Inform/TADS code writers have necessarily got to learn more to begin with and thus are very likely (almost certain in fact) to produce a superior product.  <br/><br/>The question was 'is Quest easy to use' - my answer (summarised) was yes it is, but be aware that a couple of hours of QDK is no substitute for learning to program, be it in TADS/Inform or even Quest's own ASL.  <br/><br/><blockquote><p><br/>But is doing something in the Quest GUI easier than it is in the Adrift GUI? No. <br/></p></blockquote><br/><br/>Frankly, I don't find the ADRIFT GUI any easier to use than the Quest one. They are different and no doubt each suits a different group of users, but I don't like either.  Adrift is unarguably the more popular choice by far though.  <br/><br/><blockquote><p><br/>Is coding something in the source code for Quest easier than it is in the source code for Tads or Inform? No.<br/></p></blockquote><br/><br/>I have to disagree on this, I'd place Inform and TADS as being considerably harder to write code for than Quest. Quest ASL is visual basic like, while Inform and TADS are much more C/C++ like in syntax.<br/><br/>The unique thing with Quest is that it has BOTH possibilities, GUI or conventional coding and you can mix both in the same piece. <br/><br/>Al (MaDbRiT)",
