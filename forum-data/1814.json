      "EditableText": "The description for this game reads, and I kid you not, â€œthis is honestly a great gameâ€. My, but I love an author who is modest. So then, is this a great game? Honestly?\n\nWell, hereâ€™s the description for the first room. Read it through and see if you think itâ€™s â€œgreatâ€:\n\nYOU ARE IN LIVING ROOM.\nYOU CAN GO NORTH, SOUTH, EAST OR WEST.\nYOU ARE IN THE LIVING ROOM.\nTHE DEATH BEARES HAVE TRAPPED YOU IN.\n\nHmmmâ€¦ twice I'm told I'm in the living room. Then I'm told that the â€œdeath beares {sic}â€ have me trapped. Death beares? Are they similar to normal bears only deadlier on account of the extra E? Total mystery to me, I'm afraid. Despite the aforementioned death beares having me trapped, they canâ€™t be examined, or fought, and donâ€™t seem very inclined to start attacking me. Thatâ€™s quality game testing right there and no mistake.\n\nBut wait! Thereâ€™s more! I decided to play around and see what else I could do in this â€œhonestly greatâ€ game. The room lists four exits, so I tried each of them, expecting to be moved into another location (this being generally what happens when you move in a direction). But not here. Oh no. Here we have:\n\n&gt; W\nYOU SEE A PICTURE ON THE WALL.\n\n&gt; E\nTHERE IS A RADIO.\nON THE ARIAL IT AHS A NOTE SAYING:\nTURN 180*\n\n&gt; S\nYOU SEE A SMALL TAPPESTRY.\n\n&gt; N\nYOU SEE A BARRED AND LOCKED WINDOW\n\nSoâ€¦ in this game the directional commands seem to work like an examine command. Probably just as well really as the author, in his infinite (lack of) wisdom hasnâ€™t seen fit to include descriptions of most items. Then again, the text is littered with so many spelling errors that trying to examine things would probably have me in tears anyway.\n\nIf all that wasnâ€™t bad enough (and yes, it is definitely bad enough), thereâ€™s the gameâ€™s habit of telling you what to do next. You talk to the safe and a key appears. The game advises you to take it. You take the key and the game advises you to use it. Really takes the fun out of solving these â€œpuzzlesâ€, doesnâ€™t it?\n\nThat was it. That was all I could take. To say the game was bad would be the understatement of the year. To say it was a steaming pile of camel droppings would beâ€¦ well, an insult to steaming pile of camel droppings. Itâ€™s just *so* bad itâ€™s a mystery that even the author could think it was worth releasing, let alone describing it as a great game.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the only capital letters used throughout the entire game are the ones included by Quest by default? Yep, the author apparently doesnâ€™t think capital letters are worth including himself. Then again, he didnâ€™t include a storyline or anything resembling gameplay either so I guess capital letters where they're needed was perhaps expecting too much.\n\nAvoid this one like the plague.\n\n1 out of 10",
