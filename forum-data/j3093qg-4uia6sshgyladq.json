Contrary to what the documentation  says, it seems to work for dictionaries as well.\r\n\r\nIn the case of lists, you can use the core functions `PickOneString` and `PickOneObject`, which take a single argument (a list) and return a random item from that list. They will generate an error if the returned item isn't the required type.\r\n\r\nTo get a random item from a dictionary, you would probably want something like:\r\n```\r\ncount  = GetRandomInt (1, ListCount (dict))\r\nforeach (item, dict) {\r\n  count = count - 1\r\n  if (count = 0) {\r\n    key = item\r\n    value = DictionaryItem (dict, item)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nmsg (\"The randomly selected item is key: \" + key + \", value: \" + value)\r\n```\r\n(if you were using this in a function, you could use `return` to end as soon as you find the item you want)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could keep a separate list of the keys, which is what some of the core functions do, but if the dictionary is modified often this is likely to be less efficient.",
