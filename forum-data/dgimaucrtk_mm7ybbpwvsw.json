      "EditableText": "I'm not a child anymore but I'm child-like, lol.\r\n\r\nI took my first programming class at Taylor University in summer, after I graduated 8th grade. But it wasn't actual programming, I was using a program called Scratch that taught the basics of most programming languages, without actually introducing the languages. You could make small movies and games using it, but all I ever made was a few \"animated slide shows.\" Years later, I found this website and Quest. It looked cool, so I wanted to try it out. I got confused as to what the difference between game books and text adventures, but other than that, figuring out the program was just trial and error. Quest is not exactly like Scratch, but it's very similar, so I got the hang of it quickly.\r\n\r\nJust introduce them carefully to it. Think and talk about it like a toy or book making kit. I recommend making a book, a movie, a puzzle, a fantasy room to walk in, just simple things.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps. Good luck!\r\n\r\n(P.S. I recommend Scratch too, because you can make drawings on it or upload drawings from MS Paint and make movies. Or animated slide shows. Lol.)",
