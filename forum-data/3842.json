Long time no see.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> \n\nJust thought I'd jump in and warn you that I am continuing work on WAKE. Haven't had a lot of time. Started a new job as a Software QC Engineer. I had to learn to program in C# on the fly, and now I'm surprised with how good I've gotten, when considering that I taught myself most of what I now know.\n\nNever realized things like the XAML in these projects. Or that this was made using Java (Java right?). \n\nI sort of just plugged along not really knowing what I was doing. But these last few months have taught me a ton that I hope will expedite my work on WAKE.\n\nSo I'm happy to be back!
