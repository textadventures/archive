They are both misnamed - the first one is really \"subject pronoun\" and is usually it/he/she/they, and the second one is really \"object pronoun\" and is usually it/him/her/them.\r\n\r\nThey are used in constructing default responses like \"You can't take it\".\r\n\r\nIn QuestKit, these are renamed properly - we now have subjectpronoun and objectpronoun.\r\n\r\nIn Quest 5, you normally wouldn't set these directly. Instead, you would choose from a type - \"inanimate object\", \"female character\" etc. This would set the default values by inheriting from an object type.\r\n\r\nIn QuestKit, we don't have object types - there is no inheritance. Instead, there are functions for working out default values. These are calculated by looking at two easier-to-set and now-correctly-named attributes, which are \"gender\" and \"plural\". \"gender\" for English is now \"male\", \"female\" or blank. Other languages may allow other options. Plural in English just a boolean, as it will be for most languages, although I know some of them actually have other options.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther languages will need to give their own implementations.\r\n\r\nOne other change this introduces is that the plural attribute is taken into account for the default object prefix - it now defaults to \"some\" for plural objects, which seems sensible to me\r\n",
