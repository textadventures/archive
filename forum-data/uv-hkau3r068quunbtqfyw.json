The game loves to put articles in front of all names (\"a,\" \"an,\") and it makes the text awkward and clunky. No one says \"You've entered **a** White House.\" You'd say \"You've entered the White House.\" Similarly, if I put books on a bookshelf, I can edit the default message but the articles still appear. \"On the bookshelf are several books, two of which are **an** _Anna Karenina_ and **a** _War and Peace_.\"\r\n\r\nHow do I fix this?",
