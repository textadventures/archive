I just [b:3qwiyksm]put a universal command in for non-eventful player responses.  I typed #text# as my command and added a blank print message script.[/b:3qwiyksm]  In each room the player can go in to, I added a command with that room name.  So, while in the living room, I put a command named dining cmd with a script that moved the player to the dining room.  I also put a command for x dining; look at dining; x din; look at din that produced a wanted response.  You could also (which is probably easier), create a scenery object called kitchen and add a look at script for it.\n\nThe #text# works for all non-built in Quest verbs.  You still get the built-in response for verbs like 'jump', 'smell', 'eat', etc.",

I just <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">put a universal command in for non-eventful player responses.  I typed #text# as my command and added a blank print message script.</span>  In each room the player can go in to, I added a command with that room name.  So, while in the living room, I put a command named dining cmd with a script that moved the player to the dining room.  I also put a command for x dining; look at dining; x din; look at din that produced a wanted response.  You could also (which is probably easier), create a scenery object called kitchen and add a look at script for it.<br/><br/>The #text# works for all non-built in Quest verbs.  You still get the built-in response for verbs like 'jump', 'smell', 'eat', etc.",
