I thought that maybe i should compile it first (told you i'm bad), but compiling the thing with VS2015 changed nothing, as far as i can tell.\nSo is there a guide how to deploy the runner? Can you probably give me some general guide that will work for quest or even tell me how to step-by-step set my VPS up to specifically run Quest?\nI only need it to run one game file, i don't even need the games browser and\\or other elements.\nI can't upload the file, because it's going to be a big one, heavy on pictures. I also plan to split it into multiple versions later, so i definately need a standalone runner. I don't want to distribute the actual file because people are lazy, and many of them won't bother with installing Quest to run the game.\nThank you in advance.",
