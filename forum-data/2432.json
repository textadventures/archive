Just curious because I recently tried uploading a version of RotSM and it didn't seem to be working at all.\n\nI know it says: \n&quot;When you click the &quot;Upload&quot; button below, please leave your browser to upload the file, even if doesn't seem to be doing anything. You will see a confirmation message when your file has been successfully uploaded.&quot;\n\nEven with that being said though it seems to not be loading at all. I think it might be due to the size of the upload because of my resource files (music and pictures). Once I removed them from the zip folder and uploaded only the games asl file it worked fine.",

I probably should implement a more modern file uploader which will give some feedback, because a normal file upload doesn't give you any indication that it's doing anything.\n\nAs a workaround I can manually add large games for you if you submit them via some other means.",
