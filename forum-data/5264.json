So that I could take the github code, run it, see it in action and work my way in from there. So that I understand the fundamental workflow of the code: i.e. where it begins, where it middles, and where it ends.\n\nMaybe this document already exists but I can't find it; maybe the process is very simple, but coming in from a perspective of total ignorance I'm a little lost.\n\nI can work my way into anything and have made my career out of this. I just need that bump start to get going.\n\nOverall I think the QuestKit/JS direction is perhaps the only tenable one at the moment. Apps are the new indie gaming foundation. Assuming that JS/HTML can be easily adapted/integrated for Android/iPhone apps, I'm very excited about this.\n\nAll the best,\nCalvin",
