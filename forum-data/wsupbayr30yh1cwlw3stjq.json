It's a single-file HTML game, if that helps. Upon posting a new version (via Edit this listing -> Upload a new file), the game's cover art vanished, requiring me to upload it again. This happened twice in a row this morning, and luckily it's a minor annoyance because I still have the original image. But it still looks like a bug, and might trip some people.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, the new game file was picked up just fine both times.",
