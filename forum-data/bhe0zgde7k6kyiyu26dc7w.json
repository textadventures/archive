      "EditableText": "Thank you for clarifying! I thought that was the case, from the way it's written in the documentation. Knowing that with more certainty, I went back and did some more experimenting. I seem to have found a solution, although it's not ideal to me. I think I can work with it though. I'll try to lay out the larger picture while trimming as much excess as I can. This is maybe gonna look a little weird. To explain, what I really needed here was a switch case of some kind. The player is given some option on how to try and stay awake on a long drive. So what I had before was this:\r\n```\r\nWindow:  {rotate car_window:open:closed}\r\n<br>Music: {rotate car_music:off:radio:eMuse}\r\n\r\n[[Try to stay awake]]\r\n\r\n[[Try to stay awake]]:\r\n@set path_sorter = 0\r\n## ...some code to sort the outcome by numbers to go to different passages, including...\r\n\r\n{if path_sorter=3:{off_open}}\r\n\r\n[off_open]:\r\nA bunch of scary stuff happens here.\r\n@set sanity = 100\r\n@dec sanity\r\nCurrent Sanity: {sanity}\r\n```\r\nNo arrangement of that seemed to work, but if I just took those 3 lines about sanity and put them in a blank new game, they worked fine, as they should. Finally, I found that if I made the if case lead to a button to activate the passage with square brackets, instead of directly displaying the passage as embedded with the curly brackets, it worked.  So:\r\n```\r\n{if path_sorter=3:{off_open}}\r\n# had to be changed to\r\n{if path_sorter=3:[off_open]}\r\n```\r\nforcing the player to hit another button, rather than go straight to the text. Why that matters remains entirely beyond me, something about scope, or calling an embed from an embed? At any rate,  I think I can make it work, and I'll try to avoid \"embed inception\" in the future, lol.\r\n",
