The _first_ time this happens I'll add an attribute [gifted] to [bank app] that increases [credit balance] by [integer]. The second time, it'll check for the [gifted] attribute then if it finds it will just print [credit balance]. At at least one other point the character will buy something and _that_ also updates the credit balance, but I can't figure out how to set up the function for credits so I don't have to keep adding the if statements and changing it all manually for each encounter that changes the amount and can instead just call the function to update [credits].\r\n\r\nI know I need to add a script that's like ```print expression  \"You have \" + player.credits + \"credits.\"``` but that would just be for checking the amount in the player.credits attribute, not updating it. How would I update it?  This is important because eventually the game will be updated with more quests/chapters and the player will buy or sell objects more times and get more [gifted] attributes, if I can figure out this stuff to make the first test chapter in the first place.\r\n\r\nAm I going about it wrong? Should the credits be an object all their own that the player begins with having in their inventory and can be updated over time (can an object be updated often like that)? Would that make more sense anyways or is it better to have it as a status attribute? Any help would be appreciated, since it's probably highly likely just something I'm overlooking/overthinking. ",

Would it be easier to set it up with all buyable objects having an ```object.credits``` attribute value that the function can call upon to determine how much is added or subtracted from ```player.credits``` or is there some other way to do it that I'm just not aware of? \r\n\r\nFor example would this be correct: \r\n```\r\nif (object.isbuying = true) {\r\n    player.credits-object.credits=player.credits \r\n    msg \"You purchased \" + object.alias + \" and spent \" + object.credits + \" check the bank app on your data pad for your new credits balance at your earliest convenience.\"\r\n} else {\r\n    msg \"You decided not to buy \" + object.alias +\".\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand when the player eventually completes a quest: [X=the quest number which will change and XXXX is the number of credits to be added by the quest]\r\n```\r\nif (bank_app.giftedX = false) {\r\n    msg \"You have \" + player.credits+XXXX + \"credits.\"\r\n    bank_app.giftedX = true\r\n} else {\r\n    msg \"You have \" + player.credits + \"credits.\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI mostly just want to make sure I'm not overcomplicating something that can be done in a much simpler manner, for buying things, and help with understanding if my second idea about how to handle quest rewards is even viable or if I'm doing it incorrectly. I'm sorry if my wording was confusing at first (or still is), it's been a long day and I'm not the best at explaining things when I ask questions (I do apologize  for that). \r\n\r\n",

What I'm looking for is help setting a function I can call on to change the credits amount without having to type the code in each time.</p>\n<p>Like, I need help figuring out how to set it up so that <code>player.credits</code> is changed by a different value that is determined as part of an if statement when the function is called. Would it be easier to set it up with all buyable objects having an <code>object.credits</code> attribute value that the function can call upon to determine how much is added or subtracted from <code>player.credits</code> or is there some other way to do it that I'm just not aware of?</p>\n<p>For example would this be correct:</p>\n<pre><code>if (object.isbuying = true) {\n    player.credits-object.credits=player.credits \n    msg \"You purchased \" + object.alias + \" and spent \" + object.credits + \" check the bank app on your data pad for your new credits balance at your earliest convenience.\"\n} else {\n    msg \"You decided not to buy \" + object.alias +\".\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and when the player eventually completes a quest: [X=the quest number which will change and XXXX is the number of credits to be added by the quest]</p>\n<pre><code>if (bank_app.giftedX = false) {\n    msg \"You have \" + player.credits+XXXX + \"credits.\"\n    bank_app.giftedX = true\n} else {\n    msg \"You have \" + player.credits + \"credits.\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I mostly just want to make sure I'm not overcomplicating something that can be done in a much simpler manner, for buying things, and help with understanding if my second idea about how to handle quest rewards is even viable or if I'm doing it incorrectly. I'm sorry if my wording was confusing at first (or still is), it's been a long day and I'm not the best at explaining things when I ask questions (I do apologize  for that).</p>\n\n",
