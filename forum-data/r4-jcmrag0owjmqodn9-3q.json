I had to rename my player back to the word \"player\" in order to make the suggestion work.\r\nI just put the alternate name as an alias. Now when I come or go and put on the costume or remove it i no longer have an object called player lingering around. Thanks again. This is my first attempt at making a text adventure using Quest and I am enjoying the experience alot. Hopefully I can make a complete story to publish  sometime soon.\r\nThanks\r\nrgauthier",
