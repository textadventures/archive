When a player enters &quot;use tap&quot; or &quot;use keg&quot; the quest engine replies with the default response.\n\nI want a different response for the Keg Tap. So I add a use verb in the object with a direct print response of &quot;try another verb!&quot;\n\nBecause I want the player to type &quot;pump keg&quot; to get the desired effect.\n\nNow here is what happens, after I add the use verb as stated above to the Keg Tap, it breaks the use verb for when the player has the pint glass and the keg is &quot;on&quot; and he types &quot;use glass on keg&quot; which should generate that the glass is filled up with beer. But if I have my added use verb on the keg object as stated above, all scripts that have a use item on another item fail to work.\n\nI hope I have explained this well and any advice would be much appreciated. \n\nCheers,\n\nScott",
