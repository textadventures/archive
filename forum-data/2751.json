Alex),\n\nI was at the Changing the Game conference (I'm Tom - the guy that presented on the 'making a game/story' resource) and since IO have set this competition I've decided to have a stab at using Quest 5 to make an 'escape from the (four) room(s)' game using KS3 science knowledge. \n\nSo far I think this is a really great tool and the hard work that you've done on it shows. Of course there's a learning curve associated with any tool, but I'm gradually getting there with bringing my puzzle ideas to life!\n\nI'll let you know what I come up with!\n\nCheers,\n\nTom",
