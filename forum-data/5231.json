You can sale a certain category like food from a grocery store or varied things like pizza and books.\nAt first your shop can only stock up to 5 items but your shop size automatically increases as you earn more profit.\nI will have a Proof of Concept up in a week or 2 to get some feedback.\nAlso, I got a lot of what I said it's going to be like, that's why I've been asking help so much.",
