However, when we go to test the game, any attempts at using the computer yield the message \"you don't have that.\" Everything up to this point works fine. What's the problem?",

You are using an object you have in a certain location (using a key on a locked door, etc...) or on something.\n\nYou will need to edit the room commands (the room the computer is in) so that it has the command \"use #object# #spare#\" and check to make sure that the variable #object# is \"computer\". The #spare# is there just incase the player types more than just \"use computer\".\n\nIf you want I can make a quick example for you!",

      "EditableText": "Yeah, I ended up figuring this out, and created a room command \"use computer.\" It seems to work now... thanks.\n\nAlthough, I have another question that I was wondering if someone could answer. I want to make it so that once you use the computer once (which triggers some actions) you can't use it again. I want it to still be in the room, but give a message along the lines of \"there isn't anything to do here.\" Right now I am accomplishing this by making the computer, once used, create an object called \"computer used\" in the room, and when the computer is accessed I have a conditional set up so that it won't work if the object \"computer used\" is in the room. This works fine, but looks awkward-- I don't like to have that extra object lying around. Since I am creating it from the script menu, I don't seem to have the option to make it invisible. Is there any other way to do this?",

Perhaps an easier way might be to set a numeric variable to 1 when you have used the computer. Quest 3.5 will introduce an even easier way to do this, as you will be able to set a \"flag\" to indicate things that have happened in your game. I will be releasing a beta version of Quest 3.5 soon, but until then using a numeric variable might be a more elegant solution than using another object - but it's up to you, as always in Quest there is more than one way of doing things.",
