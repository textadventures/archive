When the conversation is over, the player will hopefully understand that the scene is over and he's meant to leave. I've set up a few commands for this; leave; leave office; go out; go... all of which will move him from the office to the building's foyer. But, I want to set up some kind of script where any input other than those I've set, will get a response such as, 'There's nothing more to be done here.&quot; or words to that effect.\n\nI'm thinking along the lines of the 'get input &gt;&gt; if result=... &gt;&gt; otherwise print this...', which brings me to a question I've been meaning to ask for some time. Does the 'if result=&quot;...' script allow for multiple entries, i.e 'if result=&quot;leave&quot;; &quot;leave office&quot;; &quot;go out&quot;; &quot;exit&quot; '?\n\nI appreciate the game already does this to a certain degree, with default responses such as 'You can't do that' or 'I don't understand that command', but I want to give the player the sense that the game is at least listening... if that makes any sense.\n\nIs this possible, or would it involve lots of complex coding?\n\nThanks in advance.",
