Obviously, the scripts will have the same name across all rooms, and all Quest would have to do is get the player's parent, and then run that object's specified script attribute.\r\nSort of a foreach (object, GetAllChildrenObjects (player.parent)), Do (object, \"script\") kind of deal, but getting the player's parent, rather than getting the player's children.\r\n\r\nI just can't figure out how to get Quest to get the player's parent in such a way that it can then set that parent to an open-ended object function, and run the object's script. Everything else before and after that part I've got, just not this one part. The best solution I've found is to tie it all to roomenter/exit, which works fine, except the player can deplete their stamina in the room, and suffer no consequences until they leave. Which isn't that big of a deal, I suppose, but I would really prefer to set this whole mess to the player's stamina change script so that the script runs immediately upon the conditions being met, rather than when the player leaves or enters a room. And I really don't want the change script to be a mile-long list of if/if else where the game tediously checks to see if the player.parent = \"room\", when something open-ended would free me up to just add rooms as needed, without having to go back and edit the change script each time.\r\nI've pored over the forums already, and I can't seem to find a solution.\r\n\r\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated.",
