I hope to enter it in this year's IFComp, so I'd like to keep testing private for now.\r\n\r\nIn \"Redstone\" you play a reservation deputy investigating a murder at a casino. This is my first release using an experimental new graphical interface. The game uses a parser in the background, but instead of typing, the user selects words to build commands.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, please email admin at gamefic.com for a link or post here with contact information. Thanks!",
