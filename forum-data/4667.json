      "EditableText": "I thought I would try to get Quest onto my old 2000 PC Windows XP...  However, it is telling me I need a Microsoft Service Pack of 3 something or higher... is there a way to circumvent this?  What if I simply ripped the current Quest I have on here and shoved it into that?  Would that work?  I did not try because I did not want to screw anything up.  Also how easy is it to just download these Service Packs?  I just download it to a memory drive or a cd and transfer it to my old PC and hopefully it takes effect?  I am not sure it will though, there was something wrong with it back in the day, one of the reasons I stopped using it, that and I got this new laptop which was below average brand new...  But I digress.  Any suggestions would be helpful.  Thank you.",
