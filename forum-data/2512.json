Special thanks to &quot;Tomsa&quot; for giving me the idea of creating a party system. I've set it up a little differently then in &quot;Escape the Prison&quot; though. In my game you'll be able to switch between characters by clicking on the dropdown menu found in the toolbar at the top (where it says: Quest, Debug, Help). Pending on my schedule, I should have it uploaded by the end of the month. Hope everyone enjoys playing it when I do.",
