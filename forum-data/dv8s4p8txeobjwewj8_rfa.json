This does require somebody who is very proficient in JS.\r\n\r\nIt's just easier to write JavaScript inside a Squiffy section, but this gets complicated quickly. You have to constantly copy and paste, from old games to new, for one thing.\r\n\r\nI think a good middle option for beginners like me is to embed ```.js``` scripts that you want to reuse in many games. unfortunately ```<script src=\"\"></script>``` appears to get ignored.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to write scripts in a text editor and then embed them into games?\r\n\r\nThanks",
