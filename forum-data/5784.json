I'm trying to get the latest Firefox installed, but the browser versions I have are so old, none of the sites seems to be working properly and I'm having great difficulty getting it to download. I have service pack 3 which was the latest one when XP support ended, but it's not looking good. I'm getting untrusted site alerts on every page I try to view.",
