      "EditableText": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI apologize if this is a much repeated question. I did a search, but I am still not clear on this. Can I make my Squiffy choose your own adventure game a stand alone exe file? I am working on a large CYOA will a huge amount of choices and lots of different endings. Eventually I plan to have future stories (spinoffs) from the world I have created. I was hoping that one day I would be able to place it on Steam. Is this possible as things stand right now? \r\n\r\nI downloaded Squiffy and don't see a way to publish or make an exe file. I seem to only have a build command which will not work out for me in the long run.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

      "EditableText": "Hey, Aaron. Squiffy is a tool for making web-based games, pretty much by nature. Now, it's possible to wrap any web game in an executable app by using a framework such as [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) or [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/); that's how Twine 2, for example, can run on the desktop. Note, this method adds an 80-megabyte overhead to your app, because it embeds an entire browser engine -- as stated before, a web app by definition needs one to run! But it's definitely an option.",
