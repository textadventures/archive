Happy New Year! ^^\n\nI've just recently signed up, so I'm still lacking some knowledge around the place. <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> Anyways, I'd like to know how I may delete one of my games. It turns out that I wanted to update something I had published (created via Twine), but I wasn't aware I could actually update that specific adventure (oops), so I just shared another version. I've got two shared games now: The most recent an updated version of the oldest. However, I'm not sure how to remove the original (now useless) one. I've looked around My Games - Published, but no luck; all I did was unlist it and edit the title + description. However, I'd like it completely gone! Any help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",
