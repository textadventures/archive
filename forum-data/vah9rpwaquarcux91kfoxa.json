If you want to know how to input it using the graphical script editor, it will be easier to click on \"code view\" and paste the code in. Then you can go back to the GUI view to see what it looks like there.\r\n\r\nYou probably don't need to use `DiceRoll`. It's more efficient to use `GetRandomInt`, if you're only rolling a single die.\r\n\r\nYou need the result of the function to be stored in a variable, so your script would look something like:\r\n```\r\ndiceroll = GetRandomInt (1, 20)\r\nif (diceroll < 4) {\r\n  // script goes here for if the dice roll is less than 4\r\n}\r\nelse if (diceroll < 9) {\r\n  // The script that is here will be run if the roll is 4-8\r\n}\r\nelse if (diceroll < 16) {\r\n  // another piece of script goes here\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  // A script for if none of the others run\r\n  // so 16+ in this case\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`GetRandomInt` gets a random number between the two numbers you specify. It's only worth using `DiceRoll` if you're rolling multiple dice and adding them together; or if the dice you roll aren't always the same.\r\n\r\nThe scripts for each option can display messages, change the page's options, or send the player to a different page; whichever you prefer. It's worth noting that for a \"Script + Text\" page, if the script sends the player to another page then the text will not be displayed.\r\n\r\nIf you have many options in a script like that, you may find that `switch`/`case` is better than `if`. It would be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nswitch (GetRandomInt (1, 20)) {\r\n  case (1,2,3) {\r\n    // script goes here for if the dice roll is less than 4\r\n  }\r\n  case (4,5,6,7,8) {\r\n    // The script that is here will be run if the roll is 4-8\r\n  }\r\n  case (9,10,11,12,13,14,15) {\r\n    // another piece of script goes here\r\n  }\r\n  default {\r\n    // A script for if none of the others run\r\n    // so 16+ in this case\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
