      "EditableText": "make sure that your 'time' counter (Integer) VARIABLE is an Attribute VARIABLE:\r\n\r\nAttribute VARIABLES are contained/held within Objects, so they're global (you can use them anywhere, no scope/location limitation) and permanent, so long as the Object holding/containing them, exists or still exists:\r\n\r\nAttribute VARIABLE: NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\nball_1.color = \"red\"\r\nball_1.shape = \"sphere\"\r\n\r\nball_2.color = \"blue\"\r\nball_2.shape = \"oval\"\r\n\r\nsee how the 'color' and 'shape' String Attributes are DATA (characteristics/traits/attributes) OF (contained within) specific OBJECTS, so, for example:\r\n\r\n'ball_1.color' and 'ball_2.color' are two different String Attributes, despite being the same 'color' String Attribute, due to them belonging to 2 specific (different) Objects\r\n\r\nand Objects can have multiple Attributes too, as shown: 'ball_1.color' and 'ball_1.shape', and, 'ball_2.color' and 'ball_2.shape'\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\nVariable VARIABLE: NAME_OF_Variable = VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\ncolor = \"red\"\r\nshape = \"sphere\"\r\n\r\nin order to have multiple Values without Objects, you'd need multiple Variables, to simulate having Objects:\r\n\r\nball_1_color = \"red\"\r\nball_1_shape = \"sphere\"\r\n\r\nball_2_color = \"blue\"\r\nball_2_shape = \"cube\"\r\n\r\nhaving 4 Variables:\r\nball_1_color\r\nball_1_shape\r\nball_2_color\r\nball_2_shape\r\n\r\ninstead of just two Attributes (due to using Objects):\r\nNAME_OF_OBJECT.color\r\nNAME_OF_OBJECT.shape\r\n\r\nlastly, Variables only exist within their scope (location), and cease to exist once their scope's scripting (location) is done\r\n\r\none location can't use Variables from another location (unless they're passed as Parameters/Arguments), unlike with Attributes\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nGUI/Editor's 'WHATEVER' Object's Attribute Tab's Attribute box' (the box at the bottom) 'add' options/controls:\r\n\r\n[Object Name: the default 'player' Player Object, the special and required 'game' Object, or one of your 'WHATEVER' Page/Room Objects]\r\nAttribute Name: time\r\nAttribute Type: int // integer\r\nAttribute Value: 0 // or whatever value you want it to start as\r\n\r\nin code, as scripting, examples:\r\n\r\nplayer.time = 0\r\nor\r\ngame.time = 0\r\nor\r\nPage1.time = 0\r\n\r\nin GUI/Editor, as scripting, example:\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or script' Attribute -> (see below examples)\r\n\r\nset variable player.time = [EXPRESSION] 0\r\nor\r\nset variable game.time = [EXPRESSION] 0\r\nor\r\nset variable Page1.time = [EXPRESSION] 0\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nthen for your event/action that increases your 'time' counter (Integer) Attribute, you'd want, for example:\r\n\r\nusing GUI/Editor's scripting, an example:\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or script' Attribute -> (see below examples)\r\n\r\nset variable player.time = [EXPRESSION] player.time + 1\r\n\r\nor you can just do the 'increase counter' helper Script option under whatever its category/section (but this is limited to using addition and only using a '1' Value: +1 increase), whereas doing it like I showed above yourself, let's you put in whatever expression you want, for examples:\r\n\r\nset variable player.time = [EXPRESSION] player.time * 7\r\n// example using 'multiplication' and the '7' value (x7), instead of 'addition' and the '1' value (+1)\r\n\r\nand you can have as complex an expression as you'd like, for example:\r\n\r\nset variable player.maximum_life = [EXPRESSION] (player.strength + player.endurance) / 2\r\n\r\nin code, as scripting, examples:\r\n\r\nplayer.time = player.time + 1\r\n\r\nplayer.time = player.time * 7\r\n\r\nplayer.maximum_life = player.strength + player.endurance) / 2\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nand then for the other event/action that handles what happens:\r\n\r\nusing the GUI/Editor's scripting:\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'scripts' section/category -> 'if' Script -> (see below for example)\r\n\r\nif [EXPRESSION] player.time = 0\r\n\r\n-> then -> add new script -> (WHATEVER scripting)\r\n\r\nelse if [EXPRESSION] player.time = 1\r\n\r\n-> then -> add new script -> (WHATEVER scripting)\r\n\r\nelse if [EXPRESSION] player.time = 2\r\n\r\n-> then -> add new script -> (WHATEVER scripting)\r\n\r\netc etc etc more or less 'else ifs' has needed\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nor, you may want to do ranges/bounds instead, here's an example of it (as code for quickness):\r\n\r\n(using school test taking: score and grade, for this example, but its the same mechanics, just got to replace with what you're doing/using for your Objects' names and your Attributes' names, and etc whatever other changes needed for what you want to do or are doing)\r\n\r\n```\r\n// getting a random value for your test score, to see it in action:\r\n\r\ntext.score = GetRandomInt (0,100)\r\n\r\n// or, if you want to also see the min-max range/bounds checking in action:\r\n\r\ntext.score = GetRandomInt (-100,200)\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n// setting min-max bounds/range:\r\n\r\ntest.maximum_score = 100\r\ntest.minimum_score = 0\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n// min-max bounds/range checking:\r\n\r\nif (test.score > test.maximum_score) {\r\n  test.score = test.maximum_score\r\n} else if (test.score < test.minimum_score) {\r\n  test.score = test.minimum_score\r\n}\r\n\r\n// if score more than 100, score is 100\r\n// else if score is less than 0, score is 0\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n// high to low range checking:\r\n\r\nif (test.score >= 90) {\r\n  test.grade = \"A\"\r\n} else if (test.score >= 80) {\r\n  test.grade = \"B\"\r\n} else if (test.score >= 70) {\r\n  test.grade = \"C\"\r\n} else if (test.score >= 60) {\r\n  test.grade = \"D\"\r\n} else {\r\n  test.grade = \"F\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n// alternative (more efficient: less operations) high to low checking:\r\n\r\nif (test.score > 89) {\r\n  test.grade = \"A\"\r\n} else if (test.score > 79) {\r\n  test.grade = \"B\"\r\n} else if (test.score > 69) {\r\n  test.grade = \"C\"\r\n} else if (test.score > 59) {\r\n  test.grade = \"D\"\r\n} else {\r\n  test.grade = \"F\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n// low to high checking:\r\n\r\nif (test.score < 60) {\r\n  test.grade
