      "EditableText": "Lately, the desktop version of Quest has had rampant out of memory issues for me. My game is pretty large now but I don't think it should be _that_ bad.\r\n\r\nLooking into it, I've noticed that there are two points where the editor bloats its memory: when I save and when I return from code view after making a change. Saving increases the memory usage by 5-10 MB (which really adds up since I'm saving basically every minute or two) and code view changes increase the memory by a crazy 100 MB. Since these additions don't go away, the client eventually maintains 1+ GB of memory and starts having OOM errors. Relaunching resets this value but it's still pretty annoying. Depending on what I'm doing, sometimes I have to relaunch every hour.\r\n\r\nIs this some kind of bug with Quest's garbage collection or something?",
