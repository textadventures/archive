Open up your game's code file (it's the second icon from the right, across the top of the program - looks like paper with writing on it)\r\n\r\nThen find (your year may be different):\r\n```\r\n<firstpublished>2014</firstpublished>\r\n```\r\nand immeditley below add:\r\n```\r\n<css><![CDATA[\r\n    <style type=\"text/css\">\r\n\r\n</style> ]]></css>\r\n```\r\nOkay, now the fade stuff. I don't know what text it is you want to make fade in and out, so for this example I'm going to use the selector **a** which will target all text. Links, for instance, would be targeted with **a.cmdlink**\r\n\r\nSo, find the selector for your desired text and add the following in the gap between the opening and closing style tags above:\r\n```\r\na {animation-duration: 400ms; animation-name: blink; animation-iteration-count: infinite; animation-direction: alternate;}\r\n@keyframes blink {from {opacity: 1;}to {opacity: 0;}}\r\n```\r\nThis will give a very fast blink, but if you change the value to something like **8s** (where it says **400ms**) you will get a very slow fade in/out.\r\n\r\nYou'll also probably need to call the CSS.
