      "EditableText": "I was wondering if someone could help me with changing a characters appearance when typing &quot;look at me.&quot; \n\nThe idea is a static appearance when you start the game, for example:\n\nYou have a &quot;human&quot; face with &quot;thin&quot; lips, with &quot;blue&quot; eyes. Your hair is &quot;long&quot; and &quot;brown&quot;, and you stand at &quot;5'7&quot; feet/inches tall. You have &quot;narrow&quot; hips, &quot;human&quot; hands and &quot;human feet&quot; with &quot;no&quot; tail. You have a &quot;modest&quot; &quot;A-cup&quot; chest, and feel ready to take on the world. \n\n\nSo my question is when a player types &quot;look at me&quot; -------^ I want their choices throughout the game to reflect their current appearance. Like for example, taking a potion that turns your hair blonde instead of the original brown. So instead of the &quot;look at me&quot; saying [u:kbx5node]Your hair is &quot;long&quot; and &quot;brown&quot;[/u:kbx5node], it would say, [u:kbx5node]Your hair is &quot;long&quot; and &quot;blonde.&quot; [/u:kbx5node]\n\nHere are the codes of transformation I'm using for one creature. \n\nI did a global_data_object and for a potion called &quot;Cat Nip&quot; ...I made this on the object itself.. \nScriptDictionaryItem(global_data_object.neko_scriptdictionary_attribute,ToString(GetRandomInt(1,DictionaryCount(global_data_object.neko_scriptdictionary_attribute))))\n\nand this in the global data. \n\nif (HasString(player,&quot;tail_type_string_attribute&quot;) and not player.tail_type_string_attribute = &quot;cat&quot;) {\n  old_tail_type_variable = player.tail_type_string_attribute\n  player.tail_type_string_attribute = &quot;neko&quot;\n  msg (&quot; Your &quot; + old_tail_type_variable + &quot; tail remains and gently swishes around behind you.&quot;)\n}\nelse if (HasString(player,&quot;tail_type_string_attribute&quot;) and player.tail_type_string_attribute = &quot;cat&quot;) {\n  msg (&quot;You feel the potion trying to do something else to you, but it seems specifically aimed at your tail.

As you pull down your garmets, you notice a small protrusion growing longer and longer. To your horror, after about three feet, your cat tail sprouts fur and begins moving around on its own. As you tentatively touch it, you feel a certain relaxation spreading throughout your body. It is then that you realize that your tail is somehow connected to your emotions.  &quot;)\n}\n\nBut I have no idea how to apply that to the POV &quot;look at me&quot; and reflect those changes. Can anyone help?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nAlso, I'm a coding noob so you'll have to speak real clearly and slow.",

      "EditableText": "okay... wow this was a lot of work... I HOPE IT WORKS PERFECTLY (hah) !!!!!!!!!\n(since I never was able to help you before, I owe'd you, so here's the payment: if~when this code works you for, laughs)\n\n-------------\n\ncreate a new game, open the game file itself up with a text software (notepad, wordpad, notepad++, apple: text editor, etc), highlight and delete the entire code, highlight+copy+paste in my code below to your game file, save your game file, and see if it will play without any errors... HK crosses his fingers, and have fun play testing and studying this, hehe. Ask if you got any questions. Or, let me know of the (hopefully not too numerous) errors.\n\nif you're using quest version '560', than you just need to change the very top code line below in the code box, from this:\n\n&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n\nto this:\n\n&lt;asl version=&quot;560&quot;&gt;\n\n------\n\nIf~Once you understand all this ~ what I've done in my test game~code (lol), you can replace my labels with your own. Remember, that your labels (such as the 'name' of your things: Objects, Attributes, and etc) must all match up and be actually created too within your own game.\n\nfor example:\n\nyou're using my labels of 'hair_color_string_attribute', whereas Pixie's code uses 'haircolour', these 'name' Attributes are the 'IDs' for quest, so they must be unique ~ no two 'name' Attributes for the Elements (Objects, Exits, Functions, Commands, Verbs, Attributes, Turnscripts, Timers, Object Types, and etc) can be the same, so you must match them up correctly (and be sure that you actually created them too). Use my labels, use Pixie's labels, or use your own labels, but whichever you use, they must be uniform throughout your code, else you get an error:\n\nERROR: 'hair_color_string_attribute' does not match (=) up with 'haircolour'\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n[code:8x79mi9z]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

I HOPE IT WORKS PERFECTLY (hah) !!!!!!!!!<br/>(since I never was able to help you before, I owe'd you, so here's the payment: if~when this code works you for, laughs)<br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>create a new game, open the game file itself up with a text software (notepad, wordpad, notepad++, apple: text editor, etc), highlight and delete the entire code, highlight+copy+paste in my code below to your game file, save your game file, and see if it will play without any errors... HK crosses his fingers, and have fun play testing and studying this, hehe. Ask if you got any questions. Or, let me know of the (hopefully not too numerous) errors.<br/><br/>if you're using quest version '560', than you just need to change the very top code line below in the code box, from this:<br/><br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/><br/>to this:<br/><br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;560&quot;&gt;<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>If~Once you understand all this ~ what I've done in my test game~code (lol), you can replace my labels with your own. Remember, that your labels (such as the 'name' of your things: Objects, Attributes, and etc) must all match up and be actually created too within your own game.<br/><br/>for example:<br/><br/>you're using my labels of 'hair_color_string_attribute', whereas Pixie's code uses 'haircolour', these 'name' Attributes are the 'IDs' for quest, so they must be unique ~ no two 'name' Attributes for the Elements (Objects, Exits, Functions, Commands, Verbs, Attributes, Turnscripts, Timers, Object Types, and etc) can be the same, so you must match them up correctly (and be sure that you actually created them too). Use my labels, use Pixie's labels, or use your own labels, but whichever you use, they must be uniform throughout your code, else you get an error:<br/><br/>ERROR: 'hair_color_string_attribute' does not match (=) up with 'haircolour'<br/><br/>------------------------------------------<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

Like I said, it is probably the UGLIEST code ever, but it works for me.  After more changes, I may find this to be obsolete but so far so good.  Below is the code I have under a 'look at me' game command.<br/><br/><pre><code>msg (&quot;You are Alaina, a twelve year old girl&#46;&quot;)<br/>if (GetBoolean(player, &quot;unshowered&quot;)) {<br/>  msg (&quot;You have dirt on your right elbow and down your right leg&#46;  Must have been from last night's soccer game?

Just thought I'd give you my work-around &quot;solution&quot;.  I've also got a similar situation going on with 'Xanadu - In the Compound - Revenge' and it is working just fine.  Sadly, that, too is incomplete!!  Arghh!!  =/<br/><br/>Good luck and Happy Gaming!<br/><br/>XanMag",
