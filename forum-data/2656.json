But I want the player to know these variables simply through a command. I know I can do &quot;If .... is equal to 1 then print blah blah else if ..... is equal to 2 print and so on, but I was wondering if theres and easier way.\n\nAnd also if its possible can you turn status variables on and off? I'm going to have a turn counter in my game and wanted to give players the options to toggle them on and off.\n\nIf anyone could help that would be great.",
