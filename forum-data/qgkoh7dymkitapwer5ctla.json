The building is surrounded by a city scene with several buildings.\r\n\r\nSince, it is technologically advanced it’s the tallest one in the scene. The background is a dusk orange.\r\n\r\nIn the fireground, on a crane a Superhero stands there, like the one in the 8th picture that you have provided. The superhero is more focused by the camera and the building in a bit far away in the background.\r\n\r\nThe Buildings and SuperHero along with the Crane are all in Silhouette. Try to imagine that, in you head.\r\n\r\nI might be able to make the image for you, but I have to warn you i am not a Professional.\r\n\r\nHope you like the idea",
