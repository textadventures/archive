You also might want to research the setting prior to that: say your game is in a castle you might want to research castles which can give you ideas for both layout and inspiration for things you might not have thought of that you'd like to include.",

I'm guessing you were asking about a planning process where the planning information could be retained and implemented in the programming? I was more thinking about first draft. You might want to write your book in Word, but that doesn't mean you have to jot down your ideas there. But it can help I suppose.",
