It's somewhat minor but something I want to try and clean up for consistency.\n\nSo the situation is I'm having the player moved to a room via the game.pov.parent = &lt;room_name&gt; method, and the room's description is a script that includes printing text. after doing something in the room the screen is cleared and the description is showed again, so the screen stays clear without scrolling. However the first time this happens there is a noticeable jump as there is one extra blank line upon entering the room, but every time the description is displayed after that, there isn't. If anyone knows what might be causing this or how to get around it, I'd appreciate it.",
