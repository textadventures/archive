Each player(if you wanted players to have to introduce themselves or something) or npc would have a property 'name' containing their name, and a property 'unknown.desc'  Then I'd have a custom look command that went something like...\n\ncommand &lt;look&gt; {\n     for each object in &lt;#quest.currentroom[userid]#&gt; {\n            if property &lt;player.known; #quest.thing#&gt; then {\n                   inc &lt;look.pcount&gt;\n                   set string &lt;character.%look.pcount%; $objectproperty(#quest.thing#; name)$&gt;\n          }\n     }\n\nThen the hard part of the look command would be to reformat the #quest.formatobjects[userid]# string to replace the names. \n\nTo reveal the name you'd have to have a different script for players and npc's. Something like if a player speaks in a room, everyone who is there learns their name(or just a generic introduce script), and npc's a similar script when spoken to or something.\n\nI guess you could make a function like $replace(#this#; #withthis#)$ to automatically replace one string with another in and save the output as some other string variable and msg it.
