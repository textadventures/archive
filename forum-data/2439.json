      "EditableText": "You could almost do this using the default room description:\n\n- For your amulet object, give it a prefix of &quot;Lying on the sand is an emerald&quot; and a suffix of &quot;shining by the rays of the sun&quot;\n- For your key, give it an alias of &quot;silver object&quot; and a prefix of &quot;Halfway dug under the sand, you catch a glimpse of a shiny,&quot;.\n\nYou could then change the alias of the key using a script when the player examined it, if you wanted to turn it from a shiny object into a key.\n\nThis would give you everything apart from the linebreaks and the comma in the emerald suffix (as it would appear with an annoying space before it, I think), so it may be the simplest way to go.\n\nIf you don't like the standard style of room description, you can replace it globally by going to the Advanced tab on the Game editor, then giving a script for &quot;To describe rooms in the game&quot;. There's a code example here <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.axeuk.com/quest/developer/documentation/howto-roomdescriptions.htm\">http://www.axeuk.com/quest/developer/do ... ptions.htm</a><!-- m --> which it will be easier to paste into your game using Notepad.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a script just for this room by choosing &quot;Run script&quot; from the description style drop-down. It's pretty straightforward and you want a script that looks something like this:\n\n[quote:1nabd96h]\nPrint &quot;Along the shore, you see sharp rocks through the water, they appear as if they are preventing anyone to come in...
