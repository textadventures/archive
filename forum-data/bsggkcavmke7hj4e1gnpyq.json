If the player \"hits\", then their badness needs to go up. (Also, I want badness to go up less the first time than additional times, but I figure I just need a first time script) Then, if they \"self reflect\" I want it to say \"you are very bad\" if the value is greater than 10, \"you are bad\" at 10 or less, and then \"you are good\" at 0. \r\n\r\nHow might I go about doing this? Is there further complications by trying to do this with another attribute? Can I change both attributes in the same command/verb? ",
