List children is checked and the object are children of the container. When I open the container it just says &quot;open locker&quot;, no list. When I close it, it says it's already closed.\n\nEdit: I played around and found that if I set it to be open by default I can access the objects inside but when I close and reopen the container I can't anymore. I'm so confused :S",
