Do you guys know of anything?\nAs always, thanks in advance <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

If they are specific room objects, then you can control the verbs on them. If they have other uses in other rooms, then you can either have the script behaviors conditional on the room, or perhaps even swap out the real objects for dummy ones that only support the verb you want once the player enters the room.

Now, if the player has an item from the previous room, they can use that item to block the passage so the enemy cannot get to him.\nIf he does not have this object, his only option is to flee into an airduct.\nI'm really looking at a way to have the player perform one of these options while presenting an air of urgency- I can probably overcome it by wording the encounter to tell the player he has limited options. I just dont want the player to break the game continuity by entering the previous room or messing around with items.",
