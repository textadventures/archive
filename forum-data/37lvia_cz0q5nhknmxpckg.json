Also, the 'if' and 'switch' are exactly the same thing (in terms of functionality), and the 'if' is already programmed to work with the text processor commands. There's no 'else if' nor 'else' programmed into the text processor commands, so it's unlikely that 'switch' is programmed into the text processor commands, as it, on top of the 'switch' condition, requires the 'case' condition programming too, and lastly its 'default' ('else') condition. Text Processor Commands are limited in functionality, they only employ the 'if' and 'if not' conditions. There's no 'else if/case' nor 'else/default' conditions programmed in. To do 'else ifs', you simply do multiple 'if/if not' text processor commands.\r\n\r\nwhat you can do instead is to have something like this, a conceptual example:\r\n\r\n// storing your returned highest attribute from your 'get_highest_attribute' Function into an Attribute:\r\ngame.pov.highest_integer_attribute = get_highest_integer_attribute_function (game.pov)\r\n\r\n// and then, you can use that Attribute in your text processor commands:\r\nmsg (\"{if game.pov.highest_integer_attribute > 66: blah blah blah}{if game.pov.highest_integer_attribute > 33: blah blah blah}{if game.pov.highest_integer_attribute > 0: blah blah blah}\")\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nfor Boolean Attributes, these are more efficient text processor commands to use:\r\n\r\n{if OBJECT_NAME.BOOLEAN_ATTRIBUTE_NAME:blah blah blah} // if TRUE\r\n{if not OBJECT_NAME.BOOLEAN_ATTRIBUTE_NAME:blah blah blah} // if FALSE\r\n\r\nthe:\r\n\r\n{if OBJECT_NAME.ATTRIBUTE_NAME=WHATEVER_VALUE:blah blah blah}\r\n\r\nshould only be used for String Attributes, as String Attributes require it, lol.
