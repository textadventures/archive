It seems the original developer accidentally locked it. I haven't ever made a Quest game before but I'm pretty sure I know how to unlock the exit. The problem is I can't edit the game. I can see all the files in the game, but I can't change anything about them. I can add and delete files, but that's about it. Is there any way to edit the files on someone else's Quest game I downloaded?",
