There are complications though - what about when you have non-standard exits, such as in a maze, where going north and then south doesn't end up in the same room? Can a grid-based map system cope with exits of varying distances - say a room to the west that could also be accessed by going south-west, then west, then north? How do you represent the up, down and out directions on a 2D map? What about \"place\" exits?\n\nIf anybody has any ideas please let me know! I had a brief start at implementing a map for Quest 3.5 but quickly realised just how tough it would be to get the implementation right, so any suggestions would be appreciated.",

IMO, this is one of the best ones out there, the others involve hard coding, or are just a complete waste of time.  You wont HAVE to use the map editor, the main aim of it is not to make people lazy, but so you have the basic layout of your map on screen, where you can edit, change it, and even save your map layout, print it, or upload it to web space to help people navigate around your world.  You have a valid point, but i see this as an advantage for those less able to learn how to script ASL.",
