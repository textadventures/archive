Alex, you really haven't managed to give us any info on how the save process works. All of my battle engines so far crash questnet when a save is made to the game containing objects made created during the game. I'll be punching something together tomorrow as I'll have some time off, so hopefully I can volunteer some information on what I learn. Alex could you please explain in some depth to us how the save state fworks, what information it saves, etc.",

This means that when a game is loaded from a QSG, everything should be exactly the same as before. If you have code which demonstrates otherwise, please send it to me!",
