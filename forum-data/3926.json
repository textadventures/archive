Though, you can certainly keep working with the online~web version, we'll get you learning to use quest, eventually (hopefully sooner rather than later, of course, lol).\n\nI believe that the online~web version doesn't have the details on the right side~pane, right? ie, it doesn't look like this:\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/File:Blankgame.png\">http://quest5.net/wiki/File:Blankgame.png</a><!-- m -->\n\nso, if I remember right about the online~web version, you only got the:\n\nhaha (I got such bad memory!), as I re-looked up this thread:\n\n<!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=3914\">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=3914</a><!-- l -->\n\nanyways, for the online~web version, you only got the (and we'll be using Jayna's post to guide you through this too):\n\n(you're going to have to do some slight coding, ie typing in some code~script lines, but it's not too difficult *hopefully* as can be seen below)\n\n[quote=&quot;Jayna&quot;:3qsvcl52]To initialize an attribute in the online version, you can do this:\n\n- Click on the &quot;game&quot; object.\n- Click on &quot;Script&quot;\n- Click the &quot;+ Add new script&quot; button\n- In what pops up, click &quot;Variables&quot; on the left.\n- Then, on the right, click &quot;Set a variable or attribute&quot;\n- Hit OK\n- In the box beside &quot;set variable&quot;, type:\nplayer.cash\n- In the box to the right of &quot;expression&quot;, type:\n0\n\nThat should help a bit. You can do the same for any other variables you wish to add - just assign them yourself in the game start script.[/quote:3qsvcl52]\n\nCan you follow Jayna's instructions~steps? This will create (add) an attribute to an object. We need to do this, as we can't add, subtract, multiply, and~or divide upon an attribute's value, when there is no such attribute and its value to do so upon, lol.\n\nDo note:\n\nwe are *NOT* using the &quot;IncreaseObjectCounter&quot; Script choice, as this can only change it by &quot;+1&quot; amount, when you want to change it by a greater amount, lol.\n\nIn Jayna's example:\n\nplayer.cash\nplayer.cash=0\n\nan explanation of the code lines above:\n\nObject (Name Attribute of Object; it's ID tag for game engine to recognize): player\nObject &lt;connector&gt; Attribute: .

You should go through the tutorial (well of what you can do in~with the offline~web version), and even if you can't do most of it, still go through all of it, reading it, as it'll help you to understand how to do a lot of this stuff that you're having trouble with right now.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nR3. the GUI (Graphical User Interface) is simply windows~screens with buttons, folders, icons, and etc stuff for you to use (mostly with~via~for being able to use your mouse or fingers), making it easier and simplier to do stuff. All modern computers and mobile devices (via their OS ~ operating system: windows xp, windows vista, windows 7, windows 8, MacOs, and etc) utilize a GUI. Very old computers could only use &quot;command line prompts&quot; (coding ~ typing in commands of what you want to do), which obviously is very intimidating for many people. Command line prompts still exist for a good reason: they are even much more powerful, than their prototype of MS-DOS, but it takes coding~programming skill~knowledge to use them properly (as with that power, comes danger: you can completely make your computer or other electronic device not ever work again).\n\nthe GUI (Graphical User Interface) ~ Editor (for game making) mode is simply this stuff (windows with buttons and etc making it easy to do stuff):\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/File:Blankgame.png\">http://quest5.net/wiki/File:Blankgame.png</a><!-- m -->\n\nand this is what the Game Play mode looks like (on the offline~computer~desktop~downloaded version, using the text adventure choice, not the game book choice), the GUI~Editor ~ Game Play:\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/File:Playblankgame.png\">http://quest5.net/wiki/File:Playblankgame.png</a><!-- m -->\n\nAnd, in-Code (or Quest's Code View mode), it looks like this (example of~using a newly created game of the downloaded~offline~computer~desktop version, using text adventure game choice):\n\n[code:3qsvcl52]&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;d83ba5bb-2e3c-4f31-80c9-3e88a2dc082c&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2013&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:3qsvcl52]\n\nif you're willing, I can teach you to learn to use~work with~do coding, and it might be useful for you. Let my know if you want to learn to code with quest games. It's really not too terribly hard to learn, Alex did an incredible job, making it very noob-friendly to learn and use, despite how it seems right now to you. I'm sure you can learn it quickly, you'll surprise yourself, hehe.\n\n---------------\n\nR4. let's first get you able to change (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) an object's (integer) attribute's value in the sections above on this post, and then afterwards, we'll help you with how to change an object itself's amount. To begin:\n\nit involves at the most basical level:\n\nCloneObject, CreateObject, RemoveObject, DestroyObject, and~or MoveObject\n\n-----------------\n\nR5. Errors are &quot;scary&quot; because they attempt to tell you what the problem is (and thus how to fix it), but this can be cryptic, and thus &quot;scary&quot;. It does take some effort to be able to learn and understand what an error is trying to say~tell you about what the problems are that you've got, hehe.
