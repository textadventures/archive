Here's a link: [url=http&#58;//depaw&#46;wordpress&#46;com/:3ksav7km]DePawity[/url:3ksav7km]. Valid discussion is very welcomed.

Raw vegetables are best.  Tomato based sauces are good, since they're tomato, but MSG (monosodium glutamate) will destroy the value of any food, so read labels.  Meats will tire your body (the I'm full and tired effect), also MSG gives headaches since it harms nerve cells.  Being once a fiend for chocolate and peanut butter candies, it was hard to give it up, but I found a healthy alternative: buy unsalted (peeled or unpeeled; i go with peeled because I'm too lazy to de-shell) sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds (peeled or unpeeled), some dried cranberries and raisins, and for the chocolate use carob chips (carob is a plant in which a chocolate tasting something is extracted). I have a tupperware container of a 1 pound sunflower seed, 1/2 pound pumpkin seed, 1/4 pound dried berry, and 1/2 pound carob mixture.  It lasts about a week.  And since it's healthy (seeds are very healthy) it can be eaten like a meal. Pay attention to your protein intake, natural cereals can add to your daily count. Make sure the juices are 100% fruit juices without added sugars.  Grape juice and blueberry juices are good for anti-oxidation. The lesser the amount of added chemicals, the better. And just because the bottle says Vitamin A, B, C, D, E, etc.,\ndoesn't mean the vitamins are derived from natural sources. Some man-made vitamins can actually deplete your body of needed nutrition.",

And eat a fair amount of bread, but only like brown when toasted (I eat 'best of both' otherwise). I eat plenty of tomatoes, as all the pasta sauses in school are tomato based. I really want to keep eating meat though, but I find if it's quality stuff from the local farm shop I cna eat it rare and it still tastes good, which means it will have more nutrients. Also can you actually live of just seeds cos that'd be well funny/cool. Is that what you do?

Look for the word &quot;organic.&quot;  The more substances that are organic in food, the better for you.  Stay away from foods with artificial coloring in them.  A good cereal for protein will have 10+ grams of protein per 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup serving.  Lower your sodium/salt intake.  Sodium amounts can be read on a label.  Buy sea salt instead of table salt; big difference. Flax is good for you; balances chems in brain; good for alertness; can be found in good cereals or bought separate and crushed to be sprinkled on foods.  Buy a can of pumpkin and eat it; see how much vitamin A you're getting from it; loads.  Spinach is good for Vitamin A and protein.  That tub of seed/carob/dried berry mix lasts a week, so figure I eat about 1/7th of a tub a day, but I eat other things as well.  For your bread, find the healthiest loaf you can; high fiber; most nutrients; organic; don't toast it - spread honey (without preservatives) on bread for a good taste. CLOUDY??? HUH??? Rare meat???
