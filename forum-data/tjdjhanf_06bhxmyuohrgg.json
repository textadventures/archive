I'm completely noobie at programming and I tried to figure out how to do it by reading online, without success.\r\nSo far I tried to use the alpha version of QuestJS to convert the published quest file into html and Javascript\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/textadventures/quest-js/releases\r\n\r\nbut I get pop up message when I try to run the exe file telling me that I can't run in my computer. I have Windows 10, perhaps QuestJS does not work with such system.\r\n\r\nI'm quite lost now. Does anybody have converted a game into an app in the recent times? I would appreciate any help.\r\n\r\nThanks and happy gaming!",
