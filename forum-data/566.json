However, I have paused it's creation because I think it might be a bit controversial, and I don't want to waste my time for nothing. The game is about an angel that gets horny and wants to experience sex, so he is sent to earth. You are the angel, (Which, by the way, you can choose to be a straight or gay male, or straight or gay female) and your mission is to have sex with four people. As you can see, it's an adult game. So I want to know people's response to this idea; If I finish the game and post it, will people bombard me with outraged e-mails, or is this more of an open-minded crowd which will try the game? Please let me know, as I don't want to spend time creating a game that no one will play. Thanks[/quote:2pg6r25w]\n\nDidn't you post this a few days ago in the review section of someone's game?",
