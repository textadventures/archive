We were using dropbox for a while, but it became really annoying to use especially with the rate of the changes we're making to the project and the problem of us all working on it simultaneously. Also, I don't like that people can make permanent changes to the files without prior approval to certain changes. Thus, I would like to export it up to Github where I can choose which branch to pull into the project, thus is there a way to export out the req files and libraries up to Github, so that we can work on it there?",
