I'm new to the forum, and I was just wondering if there was a way for me to add attributes to the player character, without them showing up in-game in the status section.\n\nFor example, if I want the character to have 100 health and 80 endurance without it saying &quot;100&quot; and &quot;80&quot; in a status tab. I want those values to remain unknown.",
