      "EditableText": "Okay so I'm writing a romance centered interactive novel and I've got seven love interests. Throughout book 1, I want the player to be able to accumulate 'flirt points' for each character. Whoever has the most flirt points, I want to have them in book 2 be the main romance.\r\n\r\nMeaning, that I want to be able to check the variable/attributes for their flirt levels against each other. I already know how to set them like this:\r\n\r\n@set Flirt_Lav = 0\r\n\r\nAnd then if I add an @inc to each choice you make to flirt with this character, her flirt score will go up. So I have all that figured out.\r\n\r\nBut how then do I compare all the values of all the flirt Attributes/Variables to see which is highest? And then how do I set up a thing where you can ask-- if two are equal-- 'which one of these romances would you like to lock in?' to the player?\r\n\r\nI apologize if this has been asked before, please feel free to point me anywhere helpful, I'm so new to this site. I've been here a while and tried to publish my twine games but not anything in Squiffy or Quest.\r\n\r\nI had to stop using Twine, cause it crashed and I lost a whole half of my work-- plus no one at the forums really gave me simple answers and I never understood what I was doing.",

Here, both Frank and John scored equally high so the player will get to chose either one to continue. Depending on which one is picked, you go to the matching [pick *] section where you can describe what happens.\r\n\r\nThe sections I showed above can be expanded out to represent the seven you are writing about. You'll just need a separate line per fellow.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions.
