There should be an option to &quot;Not show in inventory&quot;.\n\nThat way we can customize something like &quot;examine my hands&quot; or any other part.\n\nBut what I was trying to do is costumize &quot;examine floor&quot; by putting an object &quot;floor&quot; in the inventory and hide it but it didn't work.  I also tried to clone &quot;the floor&quot; but I failed once again.\n\nWhat do you think? Any work around to achieve this?",
