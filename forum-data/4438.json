You are stunned, since from outside it appeared to just be the forest continued. An illusion. You start daydreaming,but you snap out of it as a male guard with armor and a spear faces you, demanding silver coins to proceed any further. He threatens you to kill you. I demand silver coins.

Room descriptions are not enough. It doesn't make sense to have &quot;In the center is a beautiful fountain&quot; but then have it say &quot;I can't see that&quot; when the player tries to explore the statue further. Extend your &quot;vivid descriptions&quot; (and I find it a bit ironic that the only comments on your game use those exact same words) to include the rest of your game world.\n\n2) Heading north from the initial room, there seem to be two room descriptions, one where you're in the forest (with a sword under a pile of leaves) and then one where you're in a castle. \n\n3) When you head south from the castle, you don't end up going back through the same rooms you were in heading north. Not only is this a bit confusing, but it messes up the map.\n\n4) Good point: you give the player clues about what needs to be done.\n\n5) When the game state changes, your descriptions need to as well. The sword can't be both in my hand and on the floor.\n\nKeep at the work and I'd say play test it yourself. The problem of the double room description and the room jump (and the resulting map issue because of it) should be obvious to anyone playing it, especially since they happen right away.",

I could, however, go north, which took me back to the castle, and then into the bedroom again, where I was attacked by the trolls again.   I'm not sure what's going on in your code that's doing this, but as it is it's really making it impossible to play.\n\nOne thing that I learned while making my first game that can easily trip you up is to be careful with your room descriptions!  Remember that if the player will see the description every time, then it needs to apply every time -- in other words, don't put object that can be changed or picked up in the room description (unless you use flags to turn them off), and if an event happens when you first enter then room, like the troll attack, make it a script that occurs after entering the room for the first time, rather than part of the description.  You don't want the trolls attack to play out every time!   While I didn't see this in your game so far, keep direction in mind as well; it's easy to create, say, a room called 'Top of Cliff' with a winding path leading down, then create the room 'Winding Path' with a description starting with &quot;You descend the winding path, carefully picking your way over the uneven ground...' etc.  It feels natural, since you just wrote the top of the path, but what if the player is coming back up from the bottom?

It says the same thing as in step 2. <br/>6) Go north again. You are now in the bedroom. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">And your dot on the map is now floating in space above the rooms.</span> This is what I meant by messing up the map. I doubt that's how you want it.<br/><br/>The problem is that when you go south from the bedroom, it doesn't put you back in the same room you were just in. It puts you back in the first room. I suspect you have not fixed up the south exit from the bedroom to point to the correct room.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Quest map display does not deal with this (there's not much it could do, to be honest).",

So for instance, you wrote a scene where the player kills the trolls, but you didn't put any functionality to actually change the state of the trolls from alive to dead.  You need to make it so that when a player attacks the troll with the sword, in changes from a living troll to a dead troll (the easiest way I've found to do this is to create the dead troll as another object in the room and make it start off invisible.  When the player attacks the troll, create a script that removes the troll and causes the dead troll to become visible at the same time.)",
