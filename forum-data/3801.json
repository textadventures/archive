I am trying to make a simple game for my little girl who has some issues with learning to read. \n\nI have added a container and inside that container is an object. When she opens the container, I want to try and display a message saying some thing like: &quot;You open the container and there's an (object name).&quot; Ofcourse I can display this, but I would like the object name to be clickable so she can pick it up. Right now it just shows up in the Places and Objects tab.\n\nHow do I handle this? Should I leave simple mode?\n\n(Sorry for my possibly lousy English, it's not my native language)\n\nEdit: I have searched the wiki and forums, but everything (outside the basic tutorial) handled there is waaay to advanced for me as a beginner.",
