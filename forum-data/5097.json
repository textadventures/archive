I have very limited programming knowledge, so it seems like the easiest way is to just have a few &quot;If flag=yes, then print &quot;whatever&quot;&quot; statements fire when the player loads a new page. And conveniently, you can add scripts that fire anytime you enter a new page in Quest, under the Game tab.\n\nHowever, I really want them to print at the bottom of the page so that it doesn't break the flow of the narration. Ideally it would print the text, print the choices, and then spit out your attributes and items. Like this:\n\n[code:1vq0rr2t]&quot;You see a door&#46;&quot;\n\n--Open the door&#46;\n--I hate doors&#46; I'm going home to my cave&#46;\n--Call in an airstrike!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStrength&#58; 10\nIntelligence&#58; 1\nLibido&#58; Max\n\nYou are carrying&#58;\nA sword\nA Radio\nEmotional Baggage[/code:1vq0rr2t]\n\nAny thoughts? I guess I could copy/paste the text to every page, but who knows how many pages there will eventually be. I'd rather have a more elegant solution if there is one.",
