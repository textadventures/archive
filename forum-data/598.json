Well, I understand where you're coming from, but I disagree. I don't think a game is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; based upon it's genre', but upon it's actual contents/game matter + quality. Anyway, you are right about that game; It sucked. I assume you're talking about &quot;enter&quot; or something like that? But I am still creating my sex game. I want to point out though that it's not strictly a sex game; That is to say, to all the people who aren't interesting in playing a game where all you do is type fu** her and her and..., my game is not like that. It's an actual plot, with a storyline. Think of it as a regular game with a sexual theme/motif'. It's not nearly done, as I've said, but I'm working on it. \n\nActually, I've put it on pause again because I'm making a map for the game. You might wonder why making a map would take so long, but it's because I've thought of a cool way to make one. (Or at least I think so.) Opinions would be appreciated. What I'm doing is I have the game &quot;The Sims,&quot; and I recreated the house from my game into the Sims world. I'm designing the whole house to make it look real...I'm adding furniture, decorating with wallpaper, tiles, themes, etc. Then I'm going to save pictures of rooms as .jpg, or whatever, and I haven't decided the exact method, but it's going to be something like this; Either you will have a map, and when you look/examine it, you will get a pic of the room you are in, or a menu, choosing the room you want to see. Or, I might have a dummy object in each room titled SEE ROOM or something like that, and looking/examining that will give you a pic of the room. \n\nOriginally, I started to design the house in a program called 3-d home architect, but it was too time consuming. I got the idea to do this &quot;visual map&quot; thing when I was playing one quest game or another, and the room descriptions were (as they normally are) horrible. I thought that even though this is, I know, a TEXT game, it still might be fun to SEE it sometimes. Anyway, it also makes it more fun for me, as game author, to create. \n\nAs for the &quot;slot machine&quot; game I was talking about earlier, I finished it, but I'm not going to release it, because it only contains a slot machine game, a cup and pea game, and a few characters. I don't think anyone here would find it entertaining to just &quot;examine&quot; the slot machine, win or lose some money, and get a message, &quot;Play again? Yes/No? &quot; and do that over and over again. So unless I add more games, (which, later, I might) it won't be released. \n\nThe idea to add the &quot;sex&quot; pics to a password-protected zipped folder was a good one. However, I'm in the process of deciding if I should remove the pics from the game alltogether.",

It's not nearly done, as I've said, but I'm working on it. <br/><br/>Actually, I've put it on pause again because I'm making a map for the game. You might wonder why making a map would take so long, but it's because I've thought of a cool way to make one. (Or at least I think so.) Opinions would be appreciated. What I'm doing is I have the game &quot;The Sims,&quot; and I recreated the house from my game into the Sims world. I'm designing the whole house to make it look real...I'm adding furniture, decorating with wallpaper, tiles, themes, etc. Then I'm going to save pictures of rooms as .jpg, or whatever, and I haven't decided the exact method, but it's going to be something like this; Either you will have a map, and when you look/examine it, you will get a pic of the room you are in, or a menu, choosing the room you want to see. Or, I might have a dummy object in each room titled SEE ROOM or something like that, and looking/examining that will give you a pic of the room. <br/><br/>Originally, I started to design the house in a program called 3-d home architect, but it was too time consuming. I got the idea to do this &quot;visual map&quot; thing when I was playing one quest game or another, and the room descriptions were (as they normally are) horrible. I thought that even though this is, I know, a TEXT game, it still might be fun to SEE it sometimes. Anyway, it also makes it more fun for me, as game author, to create. <br/><br/>As for the &quot;slot machine&quot; game I was talking about earlier, I finished it, but I'm not going to release it, because it only contains a slot machine game, a cup and pea game, and a few characters. I don't think anyone here would find it entertaining to just &quot;examine&quot; the slot machine, win or lose some money, and get a message, &quot;Play again? Yes/No? &quot; and do that over and over again. So unless I add more games, (which, later, I might) it won't be released. <br/><br/>The idea to add the &quot;sex&quot; pics to a password-protected zipped folder was a good one. However, I'm in the process of deciding if I should remove the pics from the game alltogether.",
