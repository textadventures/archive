I now want to be able to examine the blade and type in a description but only if the player has picked up the knife or at least that the knife is in the same room. \r\n\r\nIn other words, the blade is a sub-object of the knife. I have tried making the knife the parent object of the blade but I can't see the blade if I do that.\r\n\r\nHow can I approach this requirement?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nJim",
