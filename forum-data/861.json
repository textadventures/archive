That way, I avoid tonnes of spelling errors.\n\nIt's probably a good idea to have at least a vague idea of where your game is going before you start writing it, but I've never gone to the extreme of plotting out every little room and item before starting writing it. Takes away all the fun of the creative process if you do that.",

I'm trying out other games people have made, but I have a detatched feeling about the PC themself, I hope I can gather some inspreation on IF uniuqe ways of doing things.",
