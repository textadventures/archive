Unfortunately, I've bumped into a massive issue.\nIn the original game of King's Quest V, you walk through a large desert.  After you walk four screens of nothing but sand, a message prompts you that you are becoming dehydrated.  If you go two more screens and do not find an oasis, you die.  There are a few objects needed in the desert to complete the game.  \nI have created a grid in Excel showing the entire desert and the entire length you can walk without dying based on where the oases are placed.  It comes to a whopping 115 rooms.  There must be a more simple way to create this grid.  I was thinking that maybe I could have the player keep arriving in the same room if they go in one direction but the problem then lies with how do I make them die of dehydration after a total of 6 moves in the desert AND how do I place the oases?\nDoes this make sense?  It's difficult to explain without showing the Excel grid.\n\nBelow is a very crude example of the grid which could potentially be roughly 115 rooms.

I'm not entirely sure how to set a co-ordinate though.  I'll try to work with it.\n\n[quote:23xtjlhn]I'd probably avoid having 115 locations in a desert.

However, the description of the identical rooms are minimal.  It would be something like \"desert - all you can see is sand dunes in all directions\".  Therefore, you can click through them quite quickly until you notice the description for the room changing.\nFurther, if you map out the location of the objects as you find them, there's only about 30 of these rooms that you'd actually have to pass through.  At least you don't have to click and wait for an animated character to walk the length of the computer screen before appearing to the next one.  \nI believe it will be much easier to map through on text than it was when I mapped out the original one years ago.\n\nThe burden of this part of the game is on me trying to design it, not the player when it is finished.  Since I am trying to make this game very closely related to the original, maps are available at many sources online so it should work out quite nicely.\n\n <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\" /><!-- s:roll: -->",

I don't know what to type to create anything that looks like what you devised.  (i=0...#game:x#, #game:y#...etc...)\n\nAnyway, I will work with it.

Just have the array like so:<br/><pre><code>oasis&#91;0&#93; = room3<br/>oasis&#91;1&#93; = room3<br/>oasis&#91;2&#93; = room3<br/>oasis&#91;3&#93; = room4<br/>oasis&#91;4&#93; = room3<br/>oasis&#91;5&#93; = room3</code></pre><br/>See what I mean?</blockquote><br/><br/>I see what you mean.  Luckily, there's only about 5 significant rooms in this vast desert so I believe there is only about 3 or 4 rooms that contain an oasis [to drink from to save from dying of thirst, not as a portal to another world <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->   ]<br/><br/>I will work with your ideas.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>so I may have to get back to you tomorrow...<br/>Have a little think about it... Try to make some guesses, - maybe look at what I've typed, and instead of cut and pasting - perhaps selecting the commands in QDK and then typing in the appropriate stuff.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Great, I can't wait.  As I said, I will work with your ideas.  However, in reference to the cutting and pasting, I was referring to that bizarre code that contained the i=0 and what not.  I did find the $ubound()$ function but I don't know what it means.  So as you suggest to select commands in QDK   and typing the appropriate stuff.  I don't know what to type to create anything that looks like what you devised.  (i=0...#game:x#, #game:y#...etc...)<br/><br/>Anyway, I will work with it.

Then I also realised that if it DID go through all the array then the ending result will 99% of the time be desert. So I changed that by checking \"if ( #returning# = 1 )\".\nSo hope you have fun. Get rid of the \"msg&lt;#dest#==#oasis[i]#&gt;\" to get rid of those lines after every room movement.\n\nChange it so your desert map grid is similar to this:\n[code:2053mvv5]10,0 9,0 8,0 7,0 6,0 5,0 4,0 3,0 2,0 1,0\n10,1 9,1 8,1 7,1 6,1 5,1 4,1 3,1 2,1 1,1\n10,2 9,2 8,2 7,2 6,2 5,2 4,2 3,2 2,2 1,2\netc&#46;&#46;&#46;[/code:2053mvv5]\nSo moveing west or south increases x or y, and moving north or east decreases it.\n\nAlso - moving off the desert isn't really dealt with. So if you're at the side and move sideways even more you will automatically go back to start - no matter where you are. Same for moving too far north.",

Then I also realised that if it DID go through all the array then the ending result will 99% of the time be desert. So I changed that by checking \"if ( #returning# = 1 )\".<br/>So hope you have fun. Get rid of the \"msg&lt;#dest#==#oasis[i]#&gt;\" to get rid of those lines after every room movement.<br/><br/>Change it so your desert map grid is similar to this:<br/><pre><code>10,0 9,0 8,0 7,0 6,0 5,0 4,0 3,0 2,0 1,0<br/>10,1 9,1 8,1 7,1 6,1 5,1 4,1 3,1 2,1 1,1<br/>10,2 9,2 8,2 7,2 6,2 5,2 4,2 3,2 2,2 1,2<br/>etc&#46;&#46;&#46;</code></pre><br/>So moveing west or south increases x or y, and moving north or east decreases it.<br/><br/>Also - moving off the desert isn't really dealt with. So if you're at the side and move sideways even more you will automatically go back to start - no matter where you are. Same for moving too far north.",

Let's say (2,0) is an oasis room with its own exit to the temple room.  The temple room's only exit would be back to the oasis at (2,0).\nNow that we need no negative grid points, we can add a script that if they try to go #game:desert_y# &lt; 0, then \"You can't go further north because the cliff is blocking you\"\nDoes that sound right?  I'll work with it and see if it functions properly.  I've been busy at work (like I'm supposed to be always) so I haven't been able to mess with it much this morning.",

Made the north/south/east/west codes into a procedure. Added a \"hypothetical\" movement addition to the $desert_room$ function, and destroying exits... Only problem is I can't re-create the exit's once they're gone...<br/><br/>::EDIT::<br/>Wow - looking at it posted like this makes it look like alot of work <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /><!-- s:shock: --> ... Anyway, the line that isn't complete has \" create exit north &lt;desert;&gt; \" on it - so if you search for that, you'll see it.<br/>That whole area is about checking the hypothetical exit - so it shouldn't be too hard to mimic it in the exit script in any way...<br/>If you want help, or to pick my brains at all - I'm right here.",
