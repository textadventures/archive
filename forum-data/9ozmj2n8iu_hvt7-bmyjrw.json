      "EditableText": "Hi Michelle\r\n\r\nThe situation is a little complicated because the Quest 6 editor is still under development. The editor uses a format that is similar to Quest 5, and can, to a degree, convert Quest 5 games. Where it is lacking is converting scripts - it will have a go, but you will need to go though it by hand. It does indeed output an HTML page that can be uploaded to this web site or put on your own web site.\r\n\r\nQuest 6 without the editor is ready to use, and does everything Quest 5 does and more besides. This is more of a framework, and rather than outputting an HTML page, it _is_ the HTML page. It does have a translator, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ThePix/QuestJS/wiki/Quest-5-to-6-Translator), but has the same issues as the editor, though it is more up-to-date, so will work a little better. That said, this version does not translate settings for the user interface.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if your game has very few, or no, scripts, it would be worth a go, and I would be interested in following your progress so the translator can be tweaked (so far I have only tried it on a couple of games).",
