I spent half an hour on IFDB and couldn't find a single decent game.\r\n\r\nWhat I noticed more than anything was what appears to be a trend for obscure 'arty' type games where you're presented with a selection of links in the description that give you absolutely no clue or indication as to what they do. A typical passage would be something like:\r\n> What are **dreams?** Are you dreaming **now?** Am I? It's so **cold** here. Will I ever get out. I hear a poem about **loss** and distant memories.\r\n\r\nWhere's the logic here? How does this encourage people to do anything but randomly click the links? Where's the direction and progression? Aren't we supposed to have at least some idea what function the links perform?",
