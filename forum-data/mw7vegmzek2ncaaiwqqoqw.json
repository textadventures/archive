I would like it to be the same action if the player types 'look out window', 'look through window', 'look at window' etc. I am also wondering how to do this if you use different methods to achieve an action. For example, I would like use soap with tap to be the same result if you have the soap in the bathroom (object is visible) and type 'wash hands' or type 'use tap'.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I am typing the code three times but I know there must be a much simpler way but can't find it.
