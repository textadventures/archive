Plus, I've been waiting for ages for a new game to appear in the download section. Come on, peeps! I myself had been in middle of creating 4 games, but as you know, (I posted something about it) my hard drive was wiped out. I ended up needing to re-install xp.  <!-- s:cry: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Crying or Very sad\" /><!-- s:cry: -->  I lost EVERYTHING!!! Including countless hours of Quest work....gone!! \n\nAs of now, I haven't started creating games again; too busy getting back everything that I lost. But I hope to start again soon. I was in middle of creating an Angel game, but I lost interest since all of that code was wiped out. I need a refreshing idea. I could probably think of one, but I'd like to hear everyone's ideas: What kind of game would interest you all?\n\nAnyway, if you are in middle of creating a game, please post below what it is called, what it's about, and when you think it will be finished. (I've noticed how people are always &quot;in middle&quot; of creating a game, but they somehow are never released.)",
