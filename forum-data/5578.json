      "EditableText": "Ok, maybe I'm overthinking things here. I very recently upgraded from quest 4.0 (to 5.6.1)so that is what I'm used to working with. Now, let's say you have an arbitrary status variable, we'll call &quot;beauty&quot; and an item &quot;makeup&quot;. \n\nThe gain command is simple, upon &quot;take&quot; increase the variable beauty. I got that to work. On drop, decrease beauty. Works also. Here is where I stumble.\n\nSince the decrease is with the command &quot;drop&quot; then putting the item in a box or on a shelf doesn't decrease beauty. And for the life of me, I can't find the old &quot;on lose item&quot; only &quot;on drop item&quot;. \n\nI'm assuming I need to do this with an attribute, maybe an inherited attribute, but I can't wrap my head around that. I would only be able to change the attribute &quot;on lose item&quot;. I thought about using a turn script with a flag system, but that seems overly cumbersome? \n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
