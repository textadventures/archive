So to answer your questions:\n\n1 - Copy the gif you want to use into the same folder that your game file is. Although it will be separate for the moment, when you publish the game the gif will be bundled into the same file as the rest of the game.\n2 - To call up and display the image, use the script &quot;show a picture.&quot; Select your gif and you should be good to go.\n3 - I don't really know what you mean by delete it from memory. Using the method above the picture will be displayed as part of the text, i.e. it won't stay fixed in position, it will roll up and out of sight the same way that the rest of your text does. So long as you only call it once in the script it won't be displayed again.",
