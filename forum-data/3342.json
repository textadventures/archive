      "EditableText": "Okay, so the way my game is set up, a health system was set up. But the kicker is the player starts out severely wounded (at half health to be precise.) So I devised a revised health system in which &quot;health&quot; is an integer attribute, but not a status attribute.\n\nInstead, I want a status attribute (ironically named &quot;Status&quot;) that summarizes the player's general state of well being.\n\ni.e. \nplayer health = 100, Status= Excellent\n\nplayer health = 99-80, Status = good\n\nplayer health =40-20, Status = Wounded\n\nAnd so on an so forth. Problem is, I've been trying to set up the script to change &quot;Status&quot; depending on health, but so far everything I've tried has either resulted in the player's Status being blank or constantly being &quot;Excellent&quot;. Despite the fact that they have half health.\n\nHelp?",
