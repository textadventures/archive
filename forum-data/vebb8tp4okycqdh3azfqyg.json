I then create a cut-down demo version by deleting sections and make a new game on the website, upload it, call it Detroit Google.  Detroit Google doesn't become its own entry.  It instead saves over Detroit Mainframe.  I try again, making double sure that I'm not editing the Detroit Mainframe listing.  Does it again.  \r\n\r\nI create a whole new game using the website this time (rather than the downloaded program) so it appears in my listings, call it Detroit, add no code to it.  Edit THAT listing so I can upload Detroit Google into that file.  Hit Play.  Detroit is just an empty text adventure with no fancy code.  Go back to Detroit Mainframe.  Oh it's been copied over by Detroit Google.\r\n\r\nWhy does Detroit Mainframe keep getting updated?  Why can't I create a *new* file?  Is it because most of the code is the same?\r\n\r\nHow is this happening?  This feels like I should be making this up.\r\n\r\nI've tried Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.  Same deal both ways.",
