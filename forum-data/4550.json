      "EditableText": "So, I made an outfit you can put on in the game by using the default &quot;wear&quot; verb that comes with Quest. I am wondering if there is any way to do the opposite - to undress yourself without having to create a new verb. The reason why I am avoiding making new verbs is because I noticed that I get an &quot;Error running script&#058; No verb response defined&quot; when playing the game and typing in this newly created verb + already existing object that does not have the newly created verb added in its verbs menu. This is a problem I encountered by accident when due to my lack of knowledge I created a new verb called &quot;open&quot; for opening containers. The error appeared when I tried doing something nonsensical like typing: open wall. Since then I have learned I did not need to create a new verb for opening stuff, but I also do not want to have errors popping out if players feel the need to try nonsensical stuff with other newly created verbs.\n\nThe only way I found to avoid this error is very time consuming. Basically for each new verb I create I have to add at least a few lines to every other object I created for that particular verb. Another alternative is to skip using newly created verbs all together and use commands instead, but I am not entirely satisfied with that solution either.\n\nAny other advice what to do?",
