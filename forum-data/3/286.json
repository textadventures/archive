It's probably the lower one, nut why not try one and then the other?",

I don't know the significance of this, but it may be important. I'll try and get it running tonight. I got Slackware from the Christmas 2003 Linux Format mag dvd if anyone is interested. You can also download it free since it's opensource (as with all - or most - linux)",

Take a look at your Windows settings and play around with them (right-click the desktop, click Properties, then Settings, then Advanced, then Monitor).\n\n50Hz would be incredibly painful to look at. For me anyway. I see some people looking at 60Hz screens and it's like a flickering light bulb - I can't see why they do it, and usually you can crank the refresh rate up much higher than that.\n\nThat only applies to CRTs. For TFTs I doubt it makes much difference whatever you choose, since they don't flicker.",
