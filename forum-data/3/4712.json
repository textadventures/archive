      "EditableText": "Upon the suggestion of a fellow forum goer, while trying to find one of my old games, I visited Dosgames.com.  There I saw all sorts of retro games, over 600 they state and all free.  Although a few are demos, most are full fledged games.  Of course you have to have DOSBox or something similar to run these games.\n\nHowever, not only do they promote games, but creator utilities as well.  I checked them out and they even allow for Text Adventure makers, but Quest was no where to be found.  So I sent an email to the webmaster, since you can suggest a game.  I am hoping I have not over stepped my boundaries and this does not guarantee a spot on their list, but I do not see what harm could be done.  They say it does take about a month or so for a new update of their site, so hopefully we can see Quest on their site in the near future.",

They love it and some of them even emailed me during the summer holiday to ask if I had any more of these.
