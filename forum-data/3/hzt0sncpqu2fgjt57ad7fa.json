      "EditableText": "Hey, let's chat. I'm the grand clam. I'm fairly new to writing, but I'm not a stranger to it. It was only recently that I decided to look into writing more avidly. I am the kind of person that has 3 or 4 unfinished boardgames they are making around the house. The game I am closest to completing is a survival-horror game MUCH like Dead By Daylight. However I have been working on this game for 4-5 years, so I didn't copy anything. I like the horror genre, ALOT, but I like pretty much anything. I have always been into adventure and action, but I want my stories to go deeper into relationships and maybe even romance. I have started a text-based sci-fi game that is influenced by Phantasy Star. I probably won't ever finish it. I have also started a satire of Bond movies where you play the role of an assassin, in gamebook. If I finish anything/continue writing, the assassin-spy thing will probably be the first thing I finish. I decided to start with a story I know alittle more about, yet don't care so much about before I get into the social/emotional te-ta-te crap and ridiculously large sci-fi/fantasy adventures. I haven't played too many stories on here yet, but I have found a lot of good ones. Especially Hunting Unicorn, that one's style really surprised me.",
