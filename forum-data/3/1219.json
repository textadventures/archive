If you didn't notice this is a game entirely in text, where proper English is essential to any form of success. Personally, if I start a game and see a typo in the first four or five sentences I'll shut it off right there. I won't even play it. If you've taken a look at the rest of the games in the archive you'd see they have extremely poor English, which is why Quest is disliked. Considering everyone is speaking on the forums with this I'm sure it doesn't give others any better impression, and it's not making the rest of us too enthusiastic to play your games. We've seen no reason to think the games will come out grammatically correct. \nIf this post seems harsh - too bad. It's something you need to hear.\nBad spelling and grammar suck.",

I check and double check the spelling, grammer, tense... basically everything with a fine tooth comb. I pride myself in the fact that I will have an error free game. Ryori inputs alot of it.. so I have to triple check alot of it. I'm not saying anything negitive to my little bambi... I'm saying that she has still a few things to learn with respect to English language.\n\nOn the other hand, it's good to just come into this forum and not have to be strictly adhearent to the rules of grammar and spelling. I just post as if I'm speaking with idioms and slang (street language). I'm sure no one here speaks in 'proper english' with friends and relative. \n\nThe Buck",
