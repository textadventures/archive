I see the possibility of creating a game with Quest and advertising it on the many MUD and gaming websites.\n\nThe newer 3D and 2D games are great but if your looking for a really good roleplay environment, text is still the way to go as people have to interact with words and it is much more challenging to develop good roleplay (in my opinion) then a 2D or 3D multi-player, online game.\n\nAnd, as many of the newer games cost a fair monthly fee, and many text games are free that also plays into the picture.\n\nWhat are your opinions on the subject?",

A friend of my nephew joined an popular online RPG (no names mentioned) only to quit when he found out you have to paly before getting stronger.... I mean!!!!! ARG!!! That's the whole point of RPG. Anyways, with text you also have a very trick over the graphics, that is emotional writing. With graphics you have to try very had with added music and stuff you make the player feel actaly what you want. This can be done much easier with writing, making them feel actally what you want and descibe things/people is a certain way (as in with opinions) to make the player hate/like them. Huge advantage, also though I do like some games and think the graphics can help certain genres, with rpg's text is much better as imersion is needed, and with good writing you can be stuck in the game world like people get glued to novels!!!! Except it will never end!!! Muhahahahaha!",
