I have begun creating a new game, and those of you who know me know that i like to release information long before its release and constantly release very early demos.\n\nTHE DEMO: THe current demo (which should be up in a few days) is only very short (about eigth rooms long) and isnt that challeging as it is the opening of the game. --please read the readme which is attached to the file upon download--\n\nFBI: FBI tells the story of an FBI agent for a small north american FBI Bureau. You have worked there two years and have solved many cases alone. You have grown to become quite fond of your boss (Chief Inspector Andrew Briggs) so you are quite shocked when he tuns up dead in his office. Being an FBI agent you decide to investigate. Along the way you will meet many characters and have to overcome many obstacles that stand in your way to discovering the truth. There will be over one hundred custom commands which you can utilise through out the game and many many menues which will help you express your feelings towards other characters in the game, and get the most out of it. There will be quite a few variations in which you beat the game so this adds replay value. There will also be fully working sound in certain parts of the game, and if possible there will be one or two FMV cut scenes along the way, and there will defintly be pictures of certain areas of the game.\n\nThe game will of course be free and you guys are sure to be the first to hear information about the game. So check out the early demo and let me know if you think the project will be a success or not.\n\nESTIMATED RELEASE DATE OF FINAL GAME: December 2003\nESTIMATED RELEASE DATE OF NEXT DEMO: A few weeks from now",
