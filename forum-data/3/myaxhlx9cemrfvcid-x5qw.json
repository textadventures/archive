What's behind me?\r\n\r\nRegardless (what comes to mind):\r\n1.  scatter two Purists perpendicular to the line of their approach line and wait\r\n2.  give a rousing \"Braveheart-type\" speech and charge into battle\r\n3.  get their attention and 'escort' them to a better location\r\n4.  scatter two Purists perpendicular to the line of their approach and send them behind the forces\r\n5.  flush out wild game as a distraction\r\n6.  run back to base camp to gather troops\r\n7.  chop the head off of my weakest Purist companion and mount it on a stake... drink his blood and put on a show of utter monstronsity in hopes of scaring them off?\r\n8.  pretend to be from a travelling circus and wait for them to let down their guard\r\n9.  a combination of the above?\r\n\r\nMy point is... if I were to write a gamebook (which I don't think I will ever do because I am not a fan), I would make a page for every scenario I could think of.  It's makes the game so much more interesting (and admittedly more difficult to write).  But, the more thought the author puts in, the better the game will be.",
