It has excellent battle/magic/weapons/item/etc. systems and has it's share of puzzles and other good stuff from classic IF. If I relied on just that, however, I would do no better than anyone else. I KNOW my game is of better quality than most (probably all) of the games previously entered in the competition.\nI've got a question for Computer Whizz. Would you mind testing my game (i can't release it due to the rules of the competition) later after I've completed a good part of it? I ask you, because as far as I know you're the only one I remember being here since quest 1.x or 2.0. Since I've been around almost as long as you, you're the only one I really \"know\" if you get my drift. If you don't want to try out the game I can find someone else.",
