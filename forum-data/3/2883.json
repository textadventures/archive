I enjoy many types of video games from companies like Nintendo and Sony. It's my dream to become a singer, because I enjoy singing, and I love meeting nice people. I'm a fan of Science Fiction, Fantasy, Action, Etcetera. That's the basic part of me. Anybody who shares some common interests with me, please feel free to talk to me, I'm quite the chatterbox.\n\n-Izzy.",

I have a creative mind, I've been told and I decided to put that creativity to use. I've come up with many stories in my day, (Sci-fi, Fantasy, Action, Etc.) and I figured I should make them more interactive, and so, Here I am. I AM having difficulty getting the hang of actually &quot;Creating&quot; the game. I am willing to accept any help with &quot;programming&quot; the game that anybody may offer me. In short, I want to make text games, because it's a darn waste to have a lot of ideas running about in my brain, and no way to bring them out.",
