      "EditableText": "Dear Richard\r\n1. I eat seafood, and it will probably be the last thing I go off before becoming vegan.\r\n2. People should be allowed to drink, as long as it doesn't result in excessive violence.\r\n3. I also agree with the 'wearing leather' thing. I think that is basically a cop-out vegan.\r\n4. People should be allowed to hunt species, on the condition that:\r\nNot overly cruel, like smashing them with a hammer or anything like that, and\r\nIt doesn't accidentally result in the extinction of that species.\r\n5. #PlantLives _Do_ Matter, but seeing how they have no central nervous system or any kind of cognitive functions, they shouldn't be given rights like humans.\r\n6. Local organic is probably one of the healthiest ways to eat, and I practically only eat organic local.\r\n7. Big Food is a Big Problem (sorry for the pun), and I think that food labelling should be plain white with the company logo, the nutrition information, and a breakdown of what all the ingredients are. And, food should be made out of ingredients that aren't 30 letters long.\r\n8. Oil is a bad source of fuel.\r\n9. We have to protect the amazon (I assume that's the rainforest you were talking about), especially because the amazon provides about 6% of the earth's oxygen. This may not seem like much, but, considering the fragility of the atmosphere, 6% is the difference between life and death.\r\n10. Endangered species must be protected.\r\n11. All places should welcome refugees. It balances out in the end.\r\n12. Brexit is silly.\r\n13. Terrorists don't have a **[Expletive Depleted]** brain.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, we are aligned enough.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Sh4dow.",
