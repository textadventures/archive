I am an older gamer, to give you an indication of how old, I made my first graphic adventure on the rubber keyed spectrum 48k using a tool called GAC (Graphic Adventure Creator).  Anyway, I was curious if there are any games here that are on the 8 bit category, or even better, the 16 bit era as I missed must of those and the graphics and parsars were much better.  I think there was a game called Gnome which I have always wanted to try, and Jinxster etc.  Any graphic adventures that invoke the nostaslgia of those days and include graphics and sound would spark my interest.  Thanks in advance to anyone that can help.  Btw I used to have a Commodore Amiga 500 which a lot of those games were on.  I don't want to go down the rom route either.  ",
