Even though i'm a frequent member, and have been messing about with the program and the code for a couple of years now, i'm still not that good  lol.  Here is a list of features i would like to see implemented by the time QuestNet full version comes out....\n\n[list:ue2yd5ea]\n[*:ue2yd5ea]Save Game Feature[/*:m:ue2yd5ea]\n[*:ue2yd5ea]Telnet Compatability[/*:m:ue2yd5ea]\n[*:ue2yd5ea]The loop option fixed (doesnt work)[/*:m:ue2yd5ea]\n[*:ue2yd5ea]the ability to memo and PM other players (if you can already do this, please help)[/*:m:ue2yd5ea]\n[*:ue2yd5ea]the ability to build maps IN-GAME, and being able to add descrips/room names/and scripts.[/*:m:ue2yd5ea][/list:u:ue2yd5ea]\n\nThere are alot of other features which would make this engine GREAT, but i cant think of them right now.  Anyway, back to coding i guess.",
