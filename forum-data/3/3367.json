Well now it is here (almost).\n\nThere is a Kickstarter project currently raising funds, and it is at almost 60% with ~20 days remaining.  The more people that get on board the merrier, so if you are interested, go and take a look (and pledge if at all possible).\n\nNow a to why this post is relevant here and not just spam!\n\nOne of the pledge tiers available (a miniscule £4,500.00 GBP) is a writers pack allowing people to create OFFICIAL fictions that will be endorsed by Frontier Developments.\n\n2 people are planning on creating gamebooks - and I have just pointed them at your software as an aid to those projects.  I am hoping that they will find it useful, but I also hope that you will be interested in Elite: Dangerous.\n\nThe Kickstarter project is here: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous\">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/146 ... -dangerous</a><!-- m --> - please pledge if you can.\n\nThank you and good night.",
