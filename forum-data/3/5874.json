A friend across the road had had a Sinclair Spectrum for some time, when one Saturday afternoon my dad came home with the Electron. I wasn't into text adventures at that point, as the Spectrum didn't really cater for them, but a few months after setting it up I discovered them and was hooked, much to my dad's disapproval. He'd bought the machine as an 'educational tool', and I had to try and play them on the sly. I did try typing in the games from magazines a few times, but used to get that many errors that it was rarely worth the effort, and would always go back to lose myself in the latest TA.",

It didn't have a cartridge slot for games or anything like that, so the few games it could run had to be typed in every time you wanted to play them - which used to take me anything up to half an hour - and then after you shut the computer down, they were gone for good. Nothing could be saved. \n\nAfter that little horror, I got a Spectrum and then a Commodore. All the time I had a Spectrum, I used to sneer down my nose at those poor people with their crappy Commodores, and then when I got my Commodore I sneered down my nose at those poor people with their Spectrums. It was just the done thing at the time.",
