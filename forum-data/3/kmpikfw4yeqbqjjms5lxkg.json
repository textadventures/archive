Who would win in a <s title=\"Come on, neither of these two is ever going to fight fair\">fair*</s> fight? You might think General Zod is almost unbeatable, given the whole invulnerability thing. He's certainly stronger. But he's also (in most incarnations) solar powered. Get him away from Earth, and he's at a major disadvantage.
