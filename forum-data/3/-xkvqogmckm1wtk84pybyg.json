      "EditableText": "I have played Zork more than any other video game in my life. At 5 years old, it was pretty much my first reading, and playing growing up taught me to read/spell. It was a huge part of my childhood, I know much of the text by heart. I have an original version from 1977 on my PC, and there is no \"rubber mat\". \"There is a small mailbox here.\" That is the last sentence, before the first prompt. I've searched and searched online, and even places that claim they have the original source text, also include this \"rubber mat\" item. If it weren't for the version I have on my PC right this very moment, I might have believed all the Mandela effect malarkey were true. Can anyone tell me when/how/why this rubber mat appeared?",

My grandfather ordered Zork via mail in the early 80's, it came in an awesome box with a map and booklet of hints. It was so exciting to have that physical treasure chest to go with it, all the artwork as well. Something magical about it that can't be recreated, I suppose the era of  ultimate communication killed some of the mystery. Playing on a 4inch screen, the bright green text. No one my age (early 30's) remembers when there was no such thing as an operating system. Pop in that big ass floppy, DIR /p. Find that exec command! Haha.",
