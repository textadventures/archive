A lot of people play on Steam and although a lot do not play IF games in general, there are actually a few IF's on there, but to my knowledge there are no IF game makers.  This could be the first.  You could gain a bigger community and maybe even put more emphasis on this kind of genre.  I am not sure what all needs to be done to make it Steam accessible, but it should not cost you anything on Steam's behalf, provided it is kept free.  Being on Steam would definitely help to reach more players more easily.  Any thoughts? ",
