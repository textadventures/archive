I am a new user who decided to try out Quest to finally write the interactive adventure game books that I've been dreaming of on and off again.\r\n\r\nNow, while the forums themselves are pretty useful, my curious mind wonders if there is a server on the platform Discord where Quest users mingled in real time and can chat and help each other out. Sure, all the ideas I have in mind are at least partly covered by the manuals and guides, but something about hearing another person go \"Oh, actually in order to make it work with that you have to do this\", because while I'm good at writing a story, I am... not good at coding or scripting, despite having interest in computers themselves.\r\n\r\nAnyways, best of luck to you all out there, hopefully all our projects turn out well.",
