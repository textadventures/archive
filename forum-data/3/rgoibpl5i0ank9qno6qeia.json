It had worked great until that next (major?) update.\r\n\r\nSo does anyone keep track with the archive or list of commands to do away with those unusable and obsolete, while at the same time replacing with what actually works in it's current form? And how often do these updates create more problems then they solve?\r\n\r\nI myself am about to delve deep in this pool of information. I just do not want to get distracted by stuff irrelevant and then grow tired of wading and end up drowning... I am sure some others feel that way as well.",
