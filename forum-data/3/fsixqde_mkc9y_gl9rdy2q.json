(Sometimes you have to scroll down to find it.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nThis site also hosts non Quest games.  Most of those can only be played online from here, but if they are Inform games, you can probably download those from IFDB.  You would need an interpreter for games made with Inform, too -- Frotz for older games, Glulxe for newer games, or Lectrote for either (to name three, I suggest Frotz and Glulxe to cover both bases).\r\n\r\nBasically, find the text adventure you want to play; check the format; then search \"how to play a [format] game\" online.  Also, if you are downloading games from IFDB, it usually tells you what software you'll need to play.\r\n\r\nHappy gaming!",
