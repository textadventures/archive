Anyway, they are doing a tour that includes a few weeks in Europe.  \n\nI do not know if I am allowed to give out the dates yet or not so I'll play it safe and just say that in September I will be playing dates in Europe.  (There is one for sure in London...is that close to any of you guys).\n\nWell, I'll give out more info as I can.  When I can post the full schedule I will and maybe I'll get to meet some of you.\n\nTake care,\nMichael",
