You can still hug each other, you can still like each other, hang out, have fun, but don't take it any further than sex.  Of course, if you're the posessive, jealous type, you won't take it too easily.<br/><br/>I've had the best of both, and I prefer the less serious type of relationship.",

Things they do will not be accepted by you as something that can be gotten along with and they will feel the same about you; therefore, personality traits they have that you can't stand will make you feel as if you're being attacked, ignored, played with, etc.  When we do connect with another, and it works, then everything we've posted previously becomes false and laughable.  It's just that God isn't smart enough to have created a civilization where like minds are near enough to each other to meet and fall in love.  And if they are, well, one of the two mates are too busy because of useless tasks, such as long work days in the cubicle, are married, have 2-3 children by 2-3 other men/women, are abusive, etc.  Sure, true love does happen, but evidenced by society, hardly ever.  This is why some people excuse the whole problem with cliches like: We are put in relationships that might not be long and stable so we can learn about each other and ourselves.  What a bunch of rubbish.  Just put my true-mate in front of me and I'll be happy.  That's all I want: Happiness! I don't need to suffer, find pain, and learn about things I hate to be happy... pssst, hilarious!\n\n\n-W. Wyzwurd",
