Not by a long shot. \n\nIn the trail of Google breadcrumbs I followed here I was reading about &quot;Banner Saga&quot; <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banner_Saga\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banner_Saga</a><!-- m --> ... which looks alot like a next gen text adventure to me.  It has the distinction of being one of the most often played through owned game (least unplayed purchased game) on Steam at something like 94% completion (working for memory here) where 22% of Steam games go unplayed. Looking at Banner Saga LPs on Youtube I see plenty of text and fairly static (but nice) cell shaded animation punctuated with some &quot;higer action&quot; visual gameplay. This seems to me, on first glance, to be where at least some Quest gaming is going.\n\nSo this summer, as soon as I am finished my current Uni courses, I am going to crash build a Quest game or two. \n\nI am hoping to talk with and learn from the community here. \n\nCheers,\nChris",

I teach English as a 2nd language and I am currently making a game for them that involves the grammar of the next chapter. Text adventures  / Gamebooks are definately not dead. I use Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks in class all the time when I have some lessons left at the end of a semester. They love it and some of them even emailed me during the summer holiday to ask if I had any more of these.
