Fantastic play, well written, challenging.  I have noticed from the posts it has been up since 2014 and apparently I am the  only one to have written anything about  it.  This is a fantastic game that deserves  a lot more attention.  Please check  it out you won't be disappointed.  I have not finished the game yet but I have already mapped out more than 90 rooms and come into contact with a wide variety of surreal characters will blow you away and make you work for your goal.  Please give this guy some credit and check out his game.",

      "EditableText": "Just finished the game.  Well over 100 places to visit and a wide variety of characters to interact with.  Of all of the Dr. Who spin-offs I have played this is definitely the  most challenging and delightful one.  There are ways to make the game unwinnable but by using the save as feature before using items you can avoid the need to constantly start over.  Not a game to start unless you have some time to devote to it.  Well worth the time and effort though.  Special thanks to sarah4 who apparently was the first one to complete the game and dropped off some really good hints.  ",
