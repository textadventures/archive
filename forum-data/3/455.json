It's something like that. - type definitions... Anyway you go in and it lists loads of functions/procedures in the right-hand box, and lists of \"types\" (?) in the left hand box... In the \"filesystem\" (or quite similar) box on the left hand side, there's a list of functions which are to do with: you guessed it: the file system. Use them... It'll give you a little information on the various input's (boolean, integer, etc)...\n\nBUT - the one greatest resource you are forgetting is:\n*DING*DING*DING*DING*\n[url=http&#58;//www&#46;google&#46;com:2t7ioxh1]GOOGLE[/url:2t7ioxh1]\n... Use the function name and search for it in google, then you get the info from there.",
