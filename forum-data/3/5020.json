This &quot;reset&quot; has been chugging along for well over an hour, perhaps closer to two, and informs me it's done a grand total of 20%. Maybe Special Branch and the CIA get a look in to see what's being wiped. No idea why the process takes longer than it ever did. A bigger hard drive yeah, but it's only 2TB.",

Then tomorrow will be the loooong process of downloading everything again and the day after will be installing and updating everything. Remind me to never download daft freeware from CNet ever again as it's full of device poison.",
