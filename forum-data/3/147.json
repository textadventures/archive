There is a category on the forums called Weekly Promotion.  Basically it just lets people know about some of the services and software out there available to people.  It would be appriciated if one of the people from here who know Quest well like Al, CW, or ITID, posted to people telling them what it can do, and what people can get out of it etc.  Alex would probably be useful but hes probably far too busy to be discussing quest on the forums.  Its a new service, and is a resource centre with lots of downloads and cool stuff to look at.  <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.squiggleuk.com\">http://www.squiggleuk.com</a><!-- w --> is the address, and you can access the forums from the main menu.  there isnt anything on at atm coz its just been put up, but the forum should be good and interesting to be involed with",
