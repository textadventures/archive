The worst was my last PC though, which was bought barebones (and I later found out, had a faulty PSU). I never bothered to notice that the PSU fan wasn't turning, but did notice it was incredibly hot on the top rear end(like burn your hand hot). So I added all kinds of case fans to keep that sweet 1ghz Duron running cool, never bothering to check out the PSU fan because how often do people get faulty PSU's? One day the PC powered itself down, didn't want to turn back on for more than a few seconds, so I let it cool down for a few minutes, power it on and everythings working fine. GRRRRRIIINNNNDDDD!!!!

      "HTML": "I could easily go through that 1.6 TB in less than a month. Not even a challenge. A home cable connection and Newsgroups? That wouldn't be near enough space for me. I almost wish I had gone to college for the sake of a big fat pipe and paying 30 bucks for unlimited newsgroup access. \"20 TB a month is too much you say? Well, I payed my 30 bucks, deal with it.\"<br/><br/>I believe you can get win98 down to 200mb with a custom install. I remember the days of my .97gig Western Digital Quantum Fireball. Even better were the days when you would put down 200 bucks for your whopping 80mb HD.<br/><br/>I too forgot to bother with spacers the first time I transferred my p133 to a different case. The worst was my last PC though, which was bought barebones (and I later found out, had a faulty PSU). I never bothered to notice that the PSU fan wasn't turning, but did notice it was incredibly hot on the top rear end(like burn your hand hot). So I added all kinds of case fans to keep that sweet 1ghz Duron running cool, never bothering to check out the PSU fan because how often do people get faulty PSU's? One day the PC powered itself down, didn't want to turn back on for more than a few seconds, so I let it cool down for a few minutes, power it on and everythings working fine. GRRRRRIIINNNNDDDD!!!! Then the bastard starting shooting sparks out the back of the case for a good 10 seconds untill I powered down and sizzled for a good 2 or 3 minutes.",

You subscribe to groups(like a server or IRC channel in a sense) and check for new headers in those groups(like new mails in an outlook express inbox) and you generally grab the newest 1000-3000 headers per group. From the titles of the headers you determine what type of content is in the body of the message, you get the body of the messages, you find out how many if any files are hosted on the server or that you have locally. Then you download any attachments you want.\n\nThe benefit of newsgroups, besides that most everything we are talking about downloading(pirated crap) gets posted to newsgroups before it trickles down through IRC, BT, DC++, KaZaA, etc..., is that you are downloading the file from the source(in a sense) and the source is a massive server on a massive pipe. So basically you can top out your internet connection with whatever you are downloading.\n\nIt's not that newsgroups will necessarily take up tons of hard drive space, most newsreaders automatically delete your cache when it reaches a specified size, but that if you have unlimited newsgroup access you have virtually no wait so it's easy to blow through 10 gigs in a half hour and be like \"oh shit, i'm low on space.\"\n\nAs an example, Comcast my ISP, provides free newsgroup access with 1gig of transfer per month, up or down, which is measily. With only fetching 3000 headers from a handful of subscribed groups, and downloading only one movie (700mb Director's Cut of Maniac, a great horror/gore flick), I completely used up my 1gig of transfer in about 30 seconds of downloading. So doing the math, you can see that if you are constantly scouring hundreds of newsgroups for new headers, bodies, etc, it's easy to eat up a lot of space.",
