So, you got an 'order of operations' logic error, you need to have the 'else if (player.weight > 120)' BEFORE (ABOVE) the 'else if (player.weight >110)', to correct it.

These pants must've shrunk in the wash.\"\")\n}  else if (player.weight &gt; 120) { // since, your 'player.weight' Attribute's Value *IS* less than 110 (and also not equal to 110) to get to this line, obviously it doesn't meet this condition of if over 120, and thus you'll never ever have its nested script(s) run/activate/execute, as you can never get to this line with your 'player.weight' Attribute's Value over 120, as when it is, it gets handled already by the previous condition line: else if (player.weight &gt; 110). So, you got an 'order of operations' logic error, you need to have the 'else if (player.weight &gt; 120)' BEFORE (ABOVE) the 'else if (player.weight &gt;110)', to correct it.
