And yet sometimes when I look in one of those threads, it's not clear whether the issue has actually been solved, since sometimes the OP never responds that something proposed by someone has actually worked. \r\n\r\nSo I was wondering: who is marking these threads solved? If it's the OP, fine. If it's not (for example, if you just happen to like your answer), then I think it's more questionable. (I don't even know who can edit original thread titles.)",
