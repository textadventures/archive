What I am getting a couple of friends at school to do is do button styles for me.  So I have the user select a button style from a menu.  Let use Green for an example.  This sets a variable called btnStyle in a module to \"green\".  Then it procedes to test for the current state of the buttons: normal, or disabled.  It does this by looking at the image filename.  Once it finds the right state of the button, it loads the respective image in place of the standard one.  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to test the image.picture property because of the way MS made it.  So, as I said above: what I might need to do is set a variable when I change the image, and test that, but there has got to be an easier way to do it, surely.\n\n[EDIT] Just wondering, if I wanted to do a crossfading effect, I would need two MediaPlayer Controls, right?",
