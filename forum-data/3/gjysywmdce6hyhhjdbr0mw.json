I tried to download the Z-machine from the IF Archives and also Brass Lantern, but I think the latter just links to the former anyway and something is really wrong with the Z-machine website.  Looks like coding is all screwed up or something.\r\n\r\nEdit:  Interestingly enough that works.  Not when I go back to the game itself, but just simply opening a browser and pasting it in there.  A heck of a lot of symbols, letters and numbers for no more than a few minutes of game play though...  o_O",
