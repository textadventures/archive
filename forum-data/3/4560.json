With some of the dialects though, two people in two different parts of the region would basically not be able to understand one another or you have to try to find root words to be able to talk.  They write from left to right and frequently do not put their vowel marks.  I have tried to learn Standard Arabic, which is their way of &quot;standardizing&quot; their language, but I have read that most people do not speak in that form, but their own tongue as it were.\n\nJapanese use Katakana, Hiragana and Kanji when they write.  The first two are words written out as it were.  Sounds of usually one consonant and one vowel, with the first being their own words and the second being loan words or foreign words as it were.  Kanji are Chinese characters that they adopted.  But you can find all three in the same exact sentence and they do not use spaces.  They do not use tones like the Chinese, but they do have lengthy vowels which are quite important.  They also have ON and un readings, with ON being the Chinese readings and the kun being the Japanese and there could be several for the same word or meaning of a word.  And just because you know the ON reading, does not mean you can speak Chinese what so ever.  And then the way Kanji are combined with each other changes how they are suppose to sound or even their meanings...\n\nChinese Mandarin uses four tones and Cantonese uses six.  Mandarin, due to the Chinese Cultural Revolution, uses simplified form of their Hanzi, while Cantonese do not, they stuck with the original form.  So trying to communicate verbally wont work and writing only works now (Again thanks to the Cultural Revolution...) if you know both forms.  However, a simple sound like &quot;ji&quot;, with all four tones can add up to 20 - 40 different separate words.  Reading them you could spot the different if you knew what each sign was.  But just listening to it, you have to differentiate the four tones, plus know just from the context of the sentence what a word is...  I am tone deaf so I am not sure why I even bother and I am not sure I really want to tackle Cantonese with it's six tones at all...  Then as you said previously, even China and Japan have their own dialects on the side.\n\nAnd then there is Klingon...\n\nI may have to check out that link later.\n\nKa-plah!   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",

With some of the dialects though, two people in two different parts of the region would basically not be able to understand one another or you have to try to find root words to be able to talk.  They write from left to right and frequently do not put their vowel marks.  I have tried to learn Standard Arabic, which is their way of &quot;standardizing&quot; their language, but I have read that most people do not speak in that form, but their own tongue as it were.\n\nJapanese use Katakana, Hiragana and Kanji when they write.  The first two are words written out as it were.  Sounds of usually one consonant and one vowel, with the first being their own words and the second being loan words or foreign words as it were.  Kanji are Chinese characters that they adopted.  But you can find all three in the same exact sentence and they do not use spaces.  They do not use tones like the Chinese, but they do have lengthy vowels which are quite important.  They also have ON and un readings, with ON being the Chinese readings and the kun being the Japanese and there could be several for the same word or meaning of a word.  And just because you know the ON reading, does not mean you can speak Chinese what so ever.  And then the way Kanji are combined with each other changes how they are suppose to sound or even their meanings...\n\nChinese Mandarin uses four tones and Cantonese uses six.  Mandarin, due to the Chinese Cultural Revolution, uses simplified form of their Hanzi, while Cantonese do not, they stuck with the original form.  So trying to communicate verbally wont work and writing only works now (Again thanks to the Cultural Revolution...) if you know both forms.  However, a simple sound like &quot;ji&quot;, with all four tones can add up to 20 - 40 different separate words.  Reading them you could spot the different if you knew what each sign was.  But just listening to it, you have to differentiate the four tones, plus know just from the context of the sentence what a word is...  I am tone deaf so I am not sure why I even bother and I am not sure I really want to tackle Cantonese with it's six tones at all...  Then as you said previously, even China and Japan have their own dialects on the side.\n\nAnd then there is Klingon...\n\nI may have to check out that link later.\n\nKa-plah!   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->[/quote:3l3xeqwx]\n\nThis is how we start to talk about things that seem so unrelated to the topic.

With some of the dialects though, two people in two different parts of the region would basically not be able to understand one another or you have to try to find root words to be able to talk.  They write from left to right and frequently do not put their vowel marks.  I have tried to learn Standard Arabic, which is their way of &quot;standardizing&quot; their language, but I have read that most people do not speak in that form, but their own tongue as it were.<br/><br/>Japanese use Katakana, Hiragana and Kanji when they write.  The first two are words written out as it were.  Sounds of usually one consonant and one vowel, with the first being their own words and the second being loan words or foreign words as it were.
