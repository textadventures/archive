If you want to, I will be (sometimes) playing at 3:00-4:00 on Fridays, so if anybody wants to play with me, just search ‚ÄúGenesis MUD‚Äù on your web browser, and you can play it online or download the app. My in-game character is an elf named Exellinor. Please reply and tell me if you want to.\r\n:D",
