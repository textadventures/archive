      "EditableText": "Verb guessing can seem a little frustrating.\r\n\r\nI remember a text adventure we played when we were kids, on the Commodore 16. (Which had a *huge* 16k RAM, including a 3.7k of resident drivers for the disk and tape devices)\r\n\r\nYou get stuck in 3 rooms in a cave. There's a door at one end, and a lever at the other, but as soon as you leave the lever room, it resets. As well as a load of other objects (all of which we already knew the use of), we'd found a small pile of rocks. The whole family tried for years (literally; we'd fire up the game, with a load time of 66 minutes from tape), explore, do all the bits we knew how to do (taking about an hour), then get stuck in that cave.\r\n\r\nAll commands were either \"verb <noun>\" or \"use <noun> on <noun>\".\r\nUse rocks on lever? Jam lever? Block lever? Drop rocks? Pull the lever multiple times? Put rocks in lever? Wedge rocks in lever?\r\nInsert rocks? Stick lever?\r\n\r\nThe most annoying thing is that if you put \"jam lever\" it says \"What with?\" ... but \"Jam lever with rocks\" gives the same response because it ignores extra words at the end of the line.\r\n\"Wedge lever with rocks\" ‚Üí \"Commands should be of the form (verb) (noun)\"\r\n\"Wedge lever\" ‚Üí \"What with?\"\r\n\"Wedge rocks in lever\" ‚Üí \"You can't do that here\"\r\n\"Wedge rocks\" ‚Üí \"Where?\"\r\n\"Drop rocks\" ‚Üí \"OK\"\r\n\"Wedge lever\" ‚Üí \"What with?\"\r\n\"Pull lever\" ‚Üí \"You hear a distant grinding sound\"\r\n\"Wedge lever\" ‚Üí \"You force the rocks into the lever, to stop it from moving\"\r\n\r\nTurns out the valid sequence was \"Wedge lever\", while the rocks are on the ground, on *the turn immediately after* pulling the lever.\r\n\r\nThere was another game where \"Kick chect\" gives you \"The chest flies open!\". Whereas \"Kick (anything else)\" gives the response \"I do not know the word 'kick'.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem with verb guessing is that you have to work out both what to do, and how to say it.\r\nI think that a verbs list is better than this. It might sometimes give clues, but that's better than requiring the player to have a thesaurus.\r\n\r\nSo my thoughts:\r\n* **If you don't have displayverbs**:\r\n  * Use a thesaurus. If there's more than one way to say the same thing, make sure they all work.\r\n* **With displayverbs**:\r\n  * Put them everywhere. If you have to lick a toad in order to solve some puzzle, then make sure there is a \"lick\" verb on every object that you could reasonably be expected to lick.\r\n  * Make verbs for things that the player might reasonably be expected to do, so the ones that are the answer don't stand out so much. Maybe try to aim for a fixed 6 verbs per object, with 1-4 of them just displaying a funny message.\r\n  * That way, trying every verb on every object is a time consuming last resort, and it's easier to actually think about the puzzle.\r\n  * If there *are* displayverbs, don't make a puzzle where the answer isn't one of them. That's an interface screw. If you have to, then at least give the player a clue to make it clear they need to guess verbs.\r\n* **Maybe try Monkey Island style**?\r\n  * The original Monkey Island has a command panel, and no other verbs. \"Open/Close/Push/Pull/Use/Look at/Talk to/Walk to/Pick up/Turn on/Turn off/Give\". That's 12 options; enough that players are unlikely to try doing everything to everything unless really desperate.\r\n  * Or maybe plan out the whole game. Once you know all the verbs that are going to be necessary, put them in a command pane. It's less of a \"clue\" than displayverbs, because it doesn't tell you which ones apply to which objects.\r\n    * For the \"wedge lever\" puzzle, having a \"wedge\" verb visible from the start would have still made it obvious. But then, it *was* obvious what you're supposed to do, just not how to communicate that to the game.\r\n* Another thought: Instead of verb guessing, can you do the puzzle with the existing commands? \"Put rocks on lever\" could have worked, and doesn't give a clue.",
