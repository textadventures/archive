I am trying to not go wild, because if so, i will just write 1000 words for the first character presentation. \n\nI decided using a very simple way to check character: just use the &quot;Look at&quot; combined with &quot;self&quot; or &quot;Margareth&quot;. It describes the character, the health status, the composure status and the current clothing. Sounded more logical than using an artificial command.\n\nThis game is an exercise of doing a complete and detailed game. But i have no intention of having things more complicated than needed, so i am not using a system as labored as you are in your game.\n\nMy concern here, in this thread, is just checking if i am controlling myself and not writing too much, not suffocating the player.",

One of my favorites, among Star Trek 25th anniversary!<br/><br/>I was just trying to establish a general mood for the main character a vague, but present, sense of objective. I am trying to not go wild, because if so, i will just write 1000 words for the first character presentation. <br/><br/>I decided using a very simple way to check character: just use the &quot;Look at&quot; combined with &quot;self&quot; or &quot;Margareth&quot;. It describes the character, the health status, the composure status and the current clothing. Sounded more logical than using an artificial command.<br/><br/>This game is an exercise of doing a complete and detailed game. But i have no intention of having things more complicated than needed, so i am not using a system as labored as you are in your game.<br/><br/>My concern here, in this thread, is just checking if i am controlling myself and not writing too much, not suffocating the player.",
