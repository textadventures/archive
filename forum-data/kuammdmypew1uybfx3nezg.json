      "EditableText": "Hi, it's me again. I have another question. Since the game I am working on (finally progressing) is done with Stat tutorial, I am now working on the combat tutorial. I have a question on how to code the weapons and clothes that will boost the player's character stats.\r\n\r\n**1. GUNS & AMMO**\r\nEx. Player has a gun with 12 bullets per mag. This is the question.\r\n```1.1. How do I put a trigger than when the player's mag drops to 0 (if player finishes 12 bullets), a link will appear to tell the player to reload his/her weapon before continue using it.```\r\nSee sample below.\r\nEx. IF PLAYER NEEDS TO RELOAD\r\n```\r\nPage 1 Player has gun (12 bullets, 2 mags) goes to Page 2\r\nPage 2 Player encounters enemy.\r\n     (Page 3) go all out\r\n     (Page 4) shoot twice\r\nPage 3 Player goes all out and used 12 bullets (1 mag) and has 1 remaining mag left.\r\n     (Page 5) Reload Weapon [*trigger to show this link because player finished 1st mag]\r\n     (Page 6) Shoot (uses 3 bullets) [*will NOT appear because player has bullets left)\r\n     (Page 7) Use pocketknife\r\n```\r\nEx. IF PLAYER DOES NOT NEED TO RELOAD\r\n```\r\nPage 1 Player has gun (12 bullets, 2 mags) goes to Page 2\r\nPage 2 Player encounters enemy.\r\n     (Page 3) go all out\r\n     (Page 4) shoot twice\r\nPage 4 shoots twice\r\n     (Page 5) Reload Weapon [*will not appear because player still has 10 bullets left]\r\n     (Page 6) Shoot (uses 3 bullets) [*will appear because player has bullets left)\r\n     (Page 7) Use pocketknife\r\n```\r\n\r\n```1.2. How do I limit the mags/items that player picks up?```\r\n```\r\nEx. Player can pick up 2 weapons only. If player wants to pick up another weapon the \"You cannot use another weapon!\" text will appear.\r\n\r\nAnother instance could be for the inventory or the ammo,\r\n\r\nEx. Player has 5 mags. Player can only carry 7 all mags. So if player wants to pick up 3 more the \"You don't have a slot for more ammo\" text will appear.\r\nEx. If it's an item like first aid, etc., the player can only carry - let's say - 4 items. If player wants to pick up a 5th item the \"You cannot carry anymore!\" text will appear instead.\r\n```\r\n```1.3. Is it possible to change weapons?```\r\nThis may be too complicated already, but just wanted to ask.\r\n\r\n```1.4. Upgrading an item```\r\nIf player is given a chance to upgrade an item, like after finishing a level, how do I do that? If this is too complicated then it's okay,\r\n\r\n```1.5. CHOOSING A WEAPON```\r\n```\r\nBut I guess this is what I really want to know. I think it has the same concept as choosing a gender but instead of gender, the player will choose a weapon and each weapon has a certain set of attributes. How do I do that? I haven't done the \"choose your gender\" code yet but I've read a few posts about it.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2. CLOTHES**\r\nOkay so player can also choose a certain set of clothing. And their clothes can effect their HP and defense and stuff.\r\n```2.1. How do I increase the maximum HP of the character because of chosen clothing?```\r\nSo if player has a max of 100 HP and uses a clothing that adds 10HP to the player's max, now the player has a 110HP max.\r\nBy \"max HP\" I'm talking about, if the player takes a first aid kit,\r\n```\r\nEx. player has HP: 95 and player uses first aid kit that adds 10 to player life. My current code set (player, \"HP\", player.HP +10) will automatically add 10 and the HP will be 105\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know if my questions made sense, but please help me.\r\nThank you all in advance!",
