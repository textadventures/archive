What does the Quest engine make? Is it HTML? I've seen and downloaded the Quest JS Master but I can't get it to work, and I'm pretty confused.\r\n\r\nI know little about software, but I'm looking to commercially produce a text adventure, and right now my options are trying to rig RPG Maker MV into a text adventure format, building it from scratch somehow, or finding some other alternative.\r\n\r\nAnyone got any advice? It'd be really appreciated! ",
