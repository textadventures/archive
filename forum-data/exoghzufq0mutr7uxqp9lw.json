I also only want that message to print one time.  Example:  Attack 'fanged rat' --> \"You strike the rat with your cup of pudding (?) and it winces in pain.\"  That attack does 13 damage and the health of the rat falls from 100 to 87.  After the attack, I would like to print a message like \"The rat looks angered and ready to nibble your bum.\"  I'd like it to print only once in the range between 80-90 though.  Then, when the health falls in between 50-60 (the next range), print another message like \"The Fanged Rat seems a bit weaker, yet still a dangerous foe.\"\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?",
