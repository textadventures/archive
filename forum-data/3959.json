So, naturally, my first idea was scrapped with my old laptop.\n\nAnyways, now I'm back, and I want to get back into Quest! So, I was wondering, if I can make the time to work up a game, would you guys prefer:\n\nA zombie RPG: This was my original idea, which would have involved NPCs to interact with, a full story, and hopefully decent AI and an inventory system. I hoped to make a large, open-world adventure, with much to explore, and danger around every corner.\n\nA zombie survival simulator: This would be similar to the other one, just less oriented around an adventure, and more about survival. A game with lots of calculations and such, and you'd mainly be defending an outpost or shelter. Your weapons and other ratings would determine how well you fair against incoming zombies, etc, etc.\n\nAnyways, thanks for the input! Have a good one!",
