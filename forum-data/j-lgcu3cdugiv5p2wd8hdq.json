Is there some way to disable options, maybe based on flags?\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say section offers three choices: Choice A, Choice B, and Choice C. Once you've chosen one, you can do the other two as well, or continue on to Choice D (which is unlocked once you've done one of the first 3). I want to make it so that if you, say, choose choice B, you can't choose choice B again, and so forth, so you eventually eliminate all choices except Choice D.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking I'd need to use a flag that basically says \"This choice is already done\", so that when you go from Choice B to Choice C or whatever, Choice B is not there (while it normally would be if you had started with Choice C or Choice A). But _how_ do I disable Choice B, once I have the flag set?\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry if this is a dumb question, and sorry if I'm not making any sense. If you could break things down simply for me, I'd very greatly appreciate it since I have a learning disability and coding can be confusing to me, but any answers are appreciated anyway. Thank you very much!",
