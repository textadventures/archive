Is this your name?\", Split(\"Yes-No\", \"-\"), false) {\r\n    if (result=\"Yes\") {\r\n    //do change pov for yes\r\n    else {\r\n    //Function (from the very beginning of the code)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBut then when I tried it, I see that the alias goes back to \"player\". I tried to search the problem, and I see that the codes are actually working without the menu. So I'm suspicious that the function is the one wrong here, but I'm not sure if I'm right or how to fix it. Please help >-<",
