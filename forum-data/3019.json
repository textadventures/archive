I'm going to put this all in white text below the dots in a token attempt to protect others from spoilers, so highlight the text below the dots to be able to read it.\n............\n[color=#FFFFFF:24kke0yp]Overall, this is a pretty good and typical horror puzzles game, and a good first game. You've borrowed heavily from Silent Hill, and in a few cases, I think you've directly included text and other content from Silent Hill games. So you may want to progress to using original content next time, which is only one more step from where you are now. Unless this is intended to be a Silent Hill fan game, of course.\n\nThe main bug I see is that the inventory isn't working properly, unless this is to do with me using the online game player. The player window updates with items correctly, but typing inventory reports that I don't have anything, though I'm carrying plenty. The only item that shows when I type 'i' is the earrings.\n\nThe main areas for improvement are very typical for someone's first game - lack of synonyms, and incomplete implementation. So while you've done a good job describing perhaps half the content in the game, another half isn't there yet, and often they're important things. For instance, on the snake statue, the game doesn't know the words 'fangs', 'mouth', 'liquid' or 'blood'. In the room with the naked dolls behind the mesh, it doesn't respond to 'dolls'. On the mural, it doesn't know the word 'indentation', though I suspect the indentation is going to be important. These are just a few examples.\n\nWhen testing your game, check every single noun that you've included in your text, and consider whether the player might try to interact with that noun. Where you're sure they will, it's best to add that feature to the game. If you're sure they would, but you REALLY don't want them to, consider removing that noun from the room description. It keeps the player focused on what they can and should interact with.\n\nI haven't been able to unlock one door yet, so I'm starting to suspect the doors are red herrings? If they are, they should have less interesting descriptions than they do. Seeing a door with a heart on it makes me think there's a puzzle there. (though maybe there is?)\n\nOne thing that annoyed me though (and will annoy anyone who hits it) is stuff like 'Another fucking door description.' It's no good asking for people to be polite over on IFDB with things like this still in the game - because they will come down on you like a ton of bricks if they read such descriptions. You have to come up with proper descriptions and not leave any incomplete stuff in the game. Bugs and oversights are okay, being a smartarse isn't.\n\nMechanically though, the game's working pretty well, and it is compelling - stuff like slitting the doll's belly is icky compelling.\n\nNow, here's where I ask for help!\n\nI've got 6 objects I haven't found a use for, and I can't find any new rooms to enter. Like I say, I've yet to be able to unlock any door in the game (except getting out of the first room, and solving the riddle).\n\nI've got: the kiss key, a sheet, flowers, a bear, needles, and earrings.\n\nWhat should I do next with one of these objects? And my other big question is - are any of the other doors unockable?\n\nThanks, and congrats on your 1st game.\n\n- Wade[/color:24kke0yp]",

It makes me kind of angry since I was trying to take this game seriously...but on the other hand it's kind of hilarious.\nSilent Hill is my favorite video game series and Silent Hill 2 is my favorite THING ever, so naturally I'm going to have similarities here and there. The only part I think I took directly from it, though, was the poster on the door to the gentleman's club, as a sort of nod to the games. \nAnyway, for the next part (I'm sure you've tried something to this effect, but being my first game, I implemented it oddly) use the kiss key on the door with the heart on it. There's also a tiny bit more in the kid's room to get as well as something unnecessary (but extraordinarily helpful to get into a different room) in the walls of the hallway.\nThank you for playing, man.\n\nEdit: I see you have the earrings, nevermind about the kid's room and the holes. I was looking for the can, opener, and journal in your inventory. And in regards to other doors becoming unlockable, most of them will not be unlockable. Some events and/or items may unlock a few though.\n\nAnother edit: I just powered through the game on the browser player and there are instances of timed events (in seconds) and the browser player seems to read &quot;seconds&quot; as &quot;millabajillionths of a second&quot; and can sometimes even skip messages if they are not spaced far enough apart. =( I don't know how to fix this in my game... sorry",
