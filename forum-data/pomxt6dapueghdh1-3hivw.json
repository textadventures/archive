      "EditableText": "Hello! :) \r\n\r\nFirst of all: i'm no native english speaker, so excuse me, if i explain something badly. \r\n\r\nI try my first steps with quest 5 and i encountered a challenge. I tried varios online posts and videos, but none explained to me, what i should do. Or maybe they did, but my english was to poor to understand. \r\n\r\nThis is what i am trying to make: \r\n\r\nThere is a well, where the character is supposed to get water. As the character is a small child, it can't reach the handle. I want to make it so, that the player first needs a ladder and second a bucket to get the water. \r\nI tried to make a verb (get water) with a few ifs. \r\nIf he was no ladder (irrelevant if he has a bucket), it should say \"you can't reach it\". \r\nIf he has a ladder and no bucket, it should say \"you reach the handle\".\r\nIf he has a ladder and a bucket, it should say \"you reach the handle, let down your bucket an get it filled\".\r\nThen it should remove the bucket from inventory and give the player a \"bucket with water\". \r\n\r\nI can't get the second part to work correctly. At the moment all i can get is that the well is inaccessicle, if the player doesn't has a ladder. Is there a way i can flag the well \"on/off\", if a ladder was used with it (and in this part to remove the ladder from the game?).\r\n\r\nSecond question: How can i make it so, that after the ladder was placed by the well the description of the well changes to \"a well with a ladder\" when the player inspects it?\r\n\r\nThese questions might come as simple, but i really don't get it and there are very few tutorials  especially in german. :D\r\nPictures where i find what would also be very welcome, but that would be only a sexy bonus. \r\n\r\nAll the best",
