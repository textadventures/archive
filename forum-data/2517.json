Having never used Quest before, I am a little confused trying to translate the documentation to the new beta. Is there any substantial documentation for new users yet?\n\nI tried looking at the demos Alex posted links to (one won't open in Beta 2, btw) but I only get some very basic info from them. \n\nWhile on the subject, I was wondering about something. I notice &quot;examine&quot; isn't a default command in the parser. I grew up on infocom games so I use examine or exam or just ex all the time. How can I make an equivalent command for something simple like &quot;look at&quot;?\n\nOr, should I start with 4.1 until there is beginner documentation?",
