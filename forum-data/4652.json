Current Layer Range -3 to 3&quot; or something like that.\n\nIt happens in a room where a stairs lead down.\n\nIf I change the down direction to something like south, it's okay.  But it seems to be having an issue with &quot;down&quot;.\n\nI have the in-game map activated and I'm guessing it has to do with that.\n\nHelp please.\n\nEdit: Yeah, it does seem to be the in-game map.  I disabled the map and no problems.  Why is this?  Does the map have some kind of &quot;border&quot; which prevents it from going further?\n\nSecond Edit: This is my guess, but I have a multi-leveled dungeon.  It seems that going &quot;down&quot; too far is messing up the map which is strange but if anyone can chime in....",
