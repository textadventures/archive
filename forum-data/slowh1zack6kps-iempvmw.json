In other words, nothing really encourages me to read the descriptions.\r\n\r\nNow you could argue that to get anything from a game you need to invest a little of your own time, but I've hit upon a simple idea which might just offer a nudge of an incentive, and was wondering what others thought.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to have the links indiscernible from the rest of the text.
