      "EditableText": "**[Introduction]**\r\nFor years now, I've been wanting to make a game that could motivate me to be more productive IRL. I actually made a post here with a different account a while back about how to do a leveling system or something like that. The type of game I was trying to make was above my skill level at the time. Now that I'm more experienced I would like to try again by creating a sci-fi text adventure that mostly takes place in space. As I'm still in the planning phase, I'm posting to see if anyone has any ideas they would like to add.\r\n\r\n**[Overview]**\r\nThe player starts off as a skill-less 20 year old who wants a space job, which requires graduating from a space academy. Upon graduation, the player is left to their own devices. This game will not have a main story (I'm not really a writer), instead I would like for it to be more of a systemic sandbox. Nonetheless, the game can still have lore so any ideas for that are welcome. I plan on including more than what I've listed below, it just represents things I want to implement first.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Job(s)</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Delivery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Stat(s)</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pilot</li>\r\n<li>Mechanic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Spacecraft Type(s)</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cargo</li>\r\n<li>Personal</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n**[Character Progression]**\r\nIn other games the player character improves by performing in-game actions. The idea here is in order to progress in the game, the player has to make progress IRL. In this game, the player edits their character's stats by adding/subtracting points. This will allow the player to create their own system and change it as necessary. \r\n\r\nFor example, I may decide that for every task I complete, I get to add a point to one of my stats. Another player can use the same system, except they may want to also subtract a stat point for every uncompleted task.\r\n\r\n**[Space Academy]**\r\nThe academy is mainly there to serve as a tutorial. The player chooses the type of job they would like training in. In order to graduate, the player must have the job's minimum stat requirements and pass the appropriate evaluations. For example, pilot students will have to take a test where they are given descriptions of different types of spacecraft and have to provide the correct model name. Aspiring mechanics will be tested on the function of each spacecraft part.\r\n\r\n**[Delivery]**\r\nEmployment options for delivery include contract work and regular employment. Contract work can be performed for individuals and organizations. This type of work requires the player have their own spacecraft. Contracts won't always be available and can have a wide pay range. If that's too risky, the player can become employed at a company where a spacecraft will be provided and work is consistent. The only downside is that the pay is much lower.\r\n\r\nTechnically any spacecraft can be used for delivery, but its best to use one designed for cargo transportation.\r\n\r\n**[Spacecrafts]**\r\nThe player can name any owned spacecrafts but each will have a model name. I would like for there to be a systematic approach to model names but I haven't completely thought this out. I was thinking that model names could follow this pattern: [Purpose]-[Letter Modifier]-[# Modifier]. A cargo spacecraft's model name could be C-XYZ-1010, where 'C' stands for cargo. I don't know what the other name parts could signify yet.\r\n\r\nThe quality of parts the spacecraft is made out of will affect how it performs. Cheaper parts will require more maintenance and repair. How a spacecraft is constructed will change its model name. Other than propellers, which affect speed, I haven't come up with any specific parts yet. I haven't thought of any cool names for them either.\r\n\r\n**[Stats]**\r\nI don't think the Pilot stat will be that involved for the first version of the game as there won't be any combat. I was thinking that the bigger and faster the spacecraft is, the harder it is to pilot. If the player attempts to fly something that is above their skill level there's a chance that the craft will move in a random direction.\r\n\r\nMechanics will be tasked with repairing, maintaining, and upgrading the ship. How long it takes to perform each of these tasks will depend on the part's quality and how high the Mechanic stat is.\r\n\r\n**[NPCs]**\r\nPlayers can hire NPCs who have the skills they may lack. If the player just wants to focus on piloting for a cargo contract, a NPC mechanic can be hired. The reverse can also happen where NPC pilots will offer to pay the player for their mechanic skills.

      "EditableText": "Yeah, since my initial post I've been doing research and have come to the realization that Quest isn't the right system. I was actually about to make another post about that here. Thanks for confirming my suspicions, @DarkLizerd.\r\n\r\nI've been working on an open-world ascii game with the same basic concept but with a fantasy setting. Its heavily inspired by the adventure mode from Dwarf Fortress. With that game, I've been doing everything from scratch using Python and Tkinter, which may not be the best tools but they get the job done. So far, there's basic world generation, player movement, npc movement, and a simple turn system. After running into memory issues, I'm starting over and using the shelve module so that I can save persistent objects to a file and initialize them later. Its do-able but its been wearing on my patience so I thought that I would try something different.\r\n\r\nBefore posting I had been looking through the Quest documentation and saw that I could use svg and javascript. Getting the svg to work would be very similar to how the graphics work in my other game so I wasn't worried about that. I was really hoping that I could write objects to a file and then initialize them later as needed to preserve memory. That's not the case apparently.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking about making a game similar to The Pixie's _Deeper_. I would like for the dungeons to be more like the ones from TES:Daggerfall. Levers, secret rooms, traps, etc. I believe adding svg to the game would help to make range combat viable. I might work on that instead.\r\n\r\n@DarkLizerd, what are your ideas for spaceship identifiers? I literally just went to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle\">vehicles</a> wikipedia page and started making up identifiers. It still isn't completely thought out though. The identifier structure is [Type]-[Sub Type]-[Sub Type of Sub Type]. For example, W-FA-001 stands for Wagon-Farm Wagon-Buckboard. A wagon is a spaceship whose locomotion is dependent on an alien creature instead of propellers. Farm wagon means that the spaceship is designed to transport items used for agriculture. Maybe Earth is over-crowded so colonies are being established on other planets and they need food? The 001 is just a numeric code for buckboard, which is a specific type of farm wagon.",
