I'm not sure what it would take, but I think mentioning the monsters that show up in the room would be beneficial?\r\n3.  Also, is it possible for you to close exits if a monster is in the room with you?  It would add a tremendous amount to the game if you could do that.  When I got down to level 9, I simply just started clicking to try and wiggle my way through the maze and I totally started ignoring the monsters.\r\n4.  Could you also only allow the purchase of each item from the shops one time?  It would up the difficulty level.\r\n5.  The orc and the ogre should be proceeded with the prefix 'an' not 'a'.  Also, the ogre does not have a description when examined.\r\n6.  Also, I noticed that when just running through the maze, it seemed that every time you entered a room that had a monster in it, then one more monster was added upon re-entering. Is it possible to go back and forth and continuously reset the monster in the room and rack up an infinite amount of gold and level?\r\n\r\nNot a bad start.  I will fully review once I have completed it.  Best of luck.",
