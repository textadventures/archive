As my game grows, I am having a hard time keeping up with what certain codes do, so I would like to add a little comment that does not show in game, but would help me a lot of keeping track of what I did and why. Is there something like that in quest?\n\nThanks in advance. You guys have been very helpful so far.",

The Quest editor strips them out when it loads and saves your main game file.",
