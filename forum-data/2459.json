And is there a way the player can check their inventory? The items in my game will have graphics and alot of items have to be found so they aren't autmatically listed. I click the box to keep them from being decripted automatically. But when you do this, it doesnt list them in the game inventory when you take the item. But that is fine if there is a way for them to just check their inventory.",

I don't want it to be scrolling on the screen if i can help it i want everything to happen in one spot i will make the messages pop up and them type commands pop ups and change the pictures with the rooms and scenes. Nothing scrolls. I will have it all in one spot. I found a way to make my messages pop up. But i still want to know how to make those disipate with a hit any key. I use picture captions and just make a paint jpeg with my message in it. If there is an easier way though, i would still like to know.",
