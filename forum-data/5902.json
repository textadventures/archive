But it seemed as though a bunch of text adventure fans would be the people to ask this. I remember playing a text based game set in 90's (maybe 80's) Hollywood. \n\n   You played as a private eye hired by a studio to investigate the death of an actress. It had real photos on top that were edited (I think they used Photoshop oil painting on them). And the text on the bottom half. \n\n    You explored Hollywood trying to discover what happened to the actress. You investigate her apartment, manager (and managers office once you set off fire alarm scaring him off), boyfriend, studio, etc. You stayed in a hotel and I think it MAY have even had some music to it. I think it was black and white (maybe). I thought it was called Bullshit or BS but I can't seem to find it.... \n\n   Obviously it has been 20 something years and it's possible that it has just faded away. But it's driving me crazy that I can't seem to find any hint of it online. I think it may have been freeware but not sure. It may have became freeware by the time I found it. Does this sound familiar to anyone?\n\n   I was hoping to play around with it again for memories but at this point I'm just hoping to find someone who remembers that it existed. Thanks to anyone who tries to help. And sorry if this isn't the right place to ask.",
