This works well if you just want one track.  If you want one to be scripted to end and then start another, obviously this method wouldn’t work.  I always had a little trouble with multiple sounds.",

Using timers may not work well because there may be a delay in the sound starting.\r\n\r\nIf you're outputting an HTML `<audio>` element, there's a few ways to do it. You could output multiple audio elements, then start each when the previous one ends. Or you could load the first sound, and then change the source when it ends. You have the javascript events `playing` (has started), `ended` (has ended), `error` (something went wrong), and `canplay` (has finished buffering and is ready to play) that you can use to control what plays when.",
