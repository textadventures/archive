up):\r\n\r\nsince you're new to this stuff, it's likely you didn't paste in your/KV's/RH's code correctly into your entire game code...\r\n\r\nwhich is supported by the error message 'does not match

europe\r\n  A. france\r\n    1. paris\r\n  B. united kingdom\r\n    1. london\r\nII. north america\r\n  A. united states\r\n    1. washington d.c.\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow, this is what happens if we do incorrect indenting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nI. europe\r\nA. france\r\n    1. paris\r\n  B. united kingdom\r\n1. london\r\n  II. north america\r\n  A. united states\r\n1. washington d.c.\r\n\r\nwhich would be this (which is totally incorrect):\r\n\r\nI. europe\r\nII. france\r\n  A. united kingdom\r\n    1. paris\r\nIII. london\r\n  A. north america\r\n  B. united states\r\nIV. washington d.c.\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nnow, for the most part, vertical placement doesn't matter, so long as you place it into the correct spot: OBJECT/ELEMENT (aka, the correct horizontal placement), after the 'game' special game settings and publishing info Object:\r\n\r\n these are all error free placements:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n
