(here we go again)...\n\nI downloaded it (w/ all virus protection off) and opened my game (which I haven't worked on for many months) and started to edit it. All I did was add a &quot;Speak to&quot; text to an object and then pushed the Save icon in the upper bar. I got some SaveFile error though. I try to push the OK button in the pop up box, but all that happened was that annoying *ding* noise. So I went to Task Manager and closed out of the QDK program.\n\nThen...\n\nI reopened QDK 4.1. I attempted to open up my game once more, but all I got was Error 62 - Input past end of file in ASL.Load From File pop up box. I pushed OK, then got the Error 9 - Subscript out of range in ASL.NumberLines pop up box. I pushed OK, but I just get that annoying *ding* indefinitely.\n\nSo... (and this is when I have a bone to pick)...\n\nI opened WordPad to open up my ASL code for my game to see how the new Speak to text was inserted at the code level. Thought maybe QDK goofed it. BUT! When I opened my game code, all I got was a Blank Screen!! So I tried opening it AGAIN! And I got a blank screen AGAIN!! Hmmm, I thought. I went to my C-drive and right clicked on my game, went to properties and discovered my game is now 0 BYTES!!!\n\nCare to explain this one ALEX!!! Has my half-way finished, very large game been erased!?!?!?!?\n\nWarning: If my game (and the countless days of programming) has been erased, I will trash Quest forever.\n\nBut,\n\nIf it hasn't, then this experience will just cause me to put off working on my game for another year or whenever. Just like every other time a new version comes out, I try it, and get errors in the first five minutes of using it. <!-- s:x --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" /><!-- s:x -->",
