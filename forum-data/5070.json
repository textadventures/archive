Neither pot has any graduation markings. You need to accurately measure 4 pints using only these pots.\n\nNow to my dilemma.\n\nIn my game I am going to have the player measure out 3 different ingredients.\n\nIf I do this accurately, then by volume 2 of the ingredients will require exactly the same amount.  However, due to densities, by weight they all require different amounts.\n\nIdeally I would like the player to have to measure 3 different amounts, otherwise s/he just had to blindly repeat the steps for the other ingredient.\n\nThe problem I am facing is, in my head at least, using weights over volumes is adding increasing complexity and numerous steps for the player to jump through.\n\nExample.\n\nIf I use volumes I can easily use multiple containers which are distinct from each other (cup, bowl, jug, etc...).  From there it is just a matter of using &quot;fill X from Y&quot; until you have the correct amounts.\n\nUsing weights I have to decide if I want to use 1 set of balances with multiple counterweights; or multiple balances, each with a fixed counter weight.\n\nThe second option is the easiest for the player as it still allows, to a certain extent, &quot;fill X from Y&quot;. The problem is that our could easily lead to confusion and I would like to avoid constant &quot;which balance&quot; questions or the player typing in-immersive prose such as &quot;pour red into green&quot;, and colour is the only real way I can think to wait distinguish separate balances.\n\nBut then, I also find it unrealistic that there would be several balances as opposed to one balance with several counter weight.\n\nThe simple solution to all this is to either stomach the fact that 2 of the volumes are identical, or use artistic licence and get the player to measure volumes, but using the weight values instead.\n\nThe ratio by volume is 7:5:5\nThe ratio by weight, however, is 15:3:2.\n\nWhat are your thoughts.",
