      "EditableText": "Hello everyone! I made a post a little while ago. Someone gave me a reply with an example included. That example helped a LOT! I have read the Squiffy Documentation several times, but for some reason the information doesn't get absorbed and I have difficulty understanding some things. \n\nAs a result I have a few more questions! It would be super awesome if you (who responds) could post an example that I could copy and paste into Squiffy and practice with.\n\n1) If I wanted to include some type of HP system (using attributes) and I wanted X/Y/Z to happen based on the range of HP, how do I accomplish this? For example:\n\nIf the player's HP is between 3 and 10, go to X section. If the player's HP is 3 or less, go to Y section. \n\n1a) How do I set up a type of 'damage' system? For example:\n\nIf players &quot;Damage&quot; attribute is 5, how would I turn that into a way to lowering the enemy_HP attribute? \n\n1b) Once the enemy's HP is 0, how do I re-route to a new section?\n\n1c) Does this system use negative numbers (10 damage subtracting from 5 HP attribute, is that -5 or 0?) and if it does work into negatives, how does that play into previous questions?\n\n\n2) Is it possible to include 'random' text? I want it to appear without the 'player' having control over it in any way. Example:\n\n&quot;Hello my name is (Susan/Jill/Kelly)&quot; \n\n\n3) Is it possible to add pictures, sound, or edit the text in any way (Bold, italics, center the text, etc)?\n\n\n4) In my previous post someone helped me with &quot;If not seen&quot;, does this same system apply to &quot;If seen&quot; ? Example:\n\nIf a certain section (that 'contains' an item) has been seen, it allows the player to open a door. \n\n5) Can you have multiple requirements for the 'seen'? Such as a story that has a bounty board, unlocking new choices once X/Y/Z sections have been passed/reached/seen (rather than through sections). The example given eliminated choices from a list, I'm thinking of adding choices in this idea.",
