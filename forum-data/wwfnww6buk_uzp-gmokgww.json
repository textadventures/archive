So I thought to set a variable at the beginning of the room as a string dictionary called girlchoice1 with the key part being letters and the value thing being the questions. The only problem is that the game keeps forgetting the variable. Is there a way to make it permanent?",

You can use an attribute in the same way as a local variable, just give the variable name as `objectname.attributename`. If the girl in this case is an NPC, then making the variable something like `girl.choice1` would make it accessible to your scripts until she is destroyed. (replacing `girl` with the actual object name if it's different). In the case of persistent variables that don't logically relate to a particular object in the game, it's normal to store them as either `player.variablename`, or `game.variablename`.",
