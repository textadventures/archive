(Master Yoda, 1981) but i am doing my best on understanding some concepts. i try to stick to the user interface and avoid much coding, but of course no one is imune on sitting and creating by hand a &quot;player.wits&quot; attribute inside a Gamebook or the like. I suppose  almost know how solving my main problems, but the solutions i came up with are not elegant enough to make me happy. Yet.",

      "EditableText": "alright, thanks for that information, as it shows me how the built-in page linking works.\n\nit indeed uses a List Attribute, which is what you're using, adding (more and more) choices to that List Attribute (which you have set to be labeled as 'Back', and thus you see multiple 'Back' choices to select from):\n\nAddPageLink (Inventory, player.exit_inventory, &quot;Back&quot;)\n\n---------------\n\nyou store the current page you're in (via: player.parent, let's say it's Page1) to the 'player.exit_inventory' Object Attribute: player.exit_inventory = player.parent\n\nand then you add that page (Page1) to your List Attribute: AddPageLink (Inventory, player.exit_inventory, &quot;Back&quot;), labeling the link choice (to Page1) as 'Back'.\n\nnow you goto another Page, and the same thing repeats:\n\nyou store the current page you're in (via: player.parent, let's say it's now Page2) to the 'player.exit_inventory' Object Attribute: player.exit_inventory = player.parent\n\nand then you add that page (Page2) to your List Attribute: AddPageLink (Inventory, player.exit_inventory, &quot;Back&quot;), labeling the link choice (to Page12) as 'Back'.\n\nand now you got as choices:\n\nBack (takes you to Page1)\nBack (takes you to Page2)\n\nand repeating for more new pages:\n\nBack (takes you to Page1)\nBack (takes you to Page2)\nBack (takes you to Page3)\nBack (takes you to Page4)\netc etc etc\n\n-------------------\n\nthus, because you're working with a List Attribute... you're going to have to have a code line to remove all those other (old) page choices from your List Attribute:\n\n(there should be some kind of) ~ 'RemovePageLink' Script/Function\n\nyou'll have to iterate (cycle) through the list and remove each item (page name), and then add in your new item (page name):\n\n[code:2g76jkxr]foreach (page_variable, Inventory) {\n  RemovePageLink (Inventory, page_variable)\n}\nAddPageLink (Inventory, player&#46;exit_inventory, &quot;Back&quot;)[/code:2g76jkxr]\n\nHK edit:\n\nactually, you shouldn't be using foreach, as you should just have a single choice in the List (your old choice, which you want to remove, so when you add in the new choice, it is the only choice in the List), but this will require a bit of work with when/how you update your 'old_page' Attribute. Using the 'foreach' method is easier to do, but in terms of coding efficiency, it shouldn't be needed/used, and so it'd be a wasteful/un-needed action (not efficient).\n\n--------\n\nor, even better, (if you can do so in the Game Book version), over-write the built-in List Attribute (thus erasing all of your old page-name choices), by creating a new List Attribute for it:\n\n(for text adventure version: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/newstringlist.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... glist.html</a><!-- m --> , <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/using_lists.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... lists.html</a><!-- m --> )\n\nInventory = NewPageLink ()\nAddPageLink (Inventory, player.exit_inventory, &quot;Back&quot;)\n\nor, maybe if there's no 'NewPageLink()' Function/Script, and there is the 'split' Function/Script, you can try using that too (as it creates/returns a List):\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/string/split.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... split.html</a><!-- m -->\n\nInventory = split (&quot;temp&quot;, &quot;;&quot;) // not sure if there's a default split (so you're not giving it, adding in, any items/choices): split (), as if you were to do this: split (&quot;&quot;, &quot;;&quot;), you'd still get a 'whitespace/blank' choice, lol\nAddPageLink (Inventory, player.exit_inventory, &quot;Back&quot;)\nRemovePageLink (Inventory, temp)",

I'll try but you may have to wait for someone who can explain and guide you through it better than I...<br/><br/>the built-in page linking, actually uses String Dictionary Attributes:<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/using_dictionaries.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... aries.html</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/newstringdictionary.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... onary.html</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/dictionary_add.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... y_add.html</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/dictionary_remove.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... emove.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>new game code (sample part) of the built-in String Dictionary Attribute that the page linking uses:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;Page1&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;options name=&quot;stringdictionary&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;item&gt;<br/>      &lt;key&gt;Page2&lt;/key&gt;<br/>      &lt;value&gt;This link goes to page 2&lt;/value&gt;<br/>    &lt;/item&gt;<br/>    &lt;item&gt;<br/>      &lt;key&gt;Page3&lt;/key&gt;<br/>      &lt;value&gt;This link goes to page 3&lt;/value&gt;<br/>    &lt;/item&gt;<br/>  &lt;/options&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>the good news is that it seems to have the same functionality as the Text Adventure... as I think I tested it correctly, getting it to work, but the bad news is that dictionaries are a bit more confusing than lists, and also this entire endeavor requires a bit of setup... hopefully you can follow along... HK crosses his fingers... as he's not good at explaining/guiding... lol<br/><br/>(I used red font to indicate it's what you type in into the text boxes)<br/><br/>'game' Game Object -&gt; 'Script' Tab -&gt; 'script when entering page' Script -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>add new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; [expression] -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>set variable <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.previous_page</span> = [expression] <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.current_page</span><br/><br/>add new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; [expression] -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>set variable <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.current_page</span> = [expression] <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.parent</span><br/><br/>add new script -&gt; scripts -&gt; 'if' Script -&gt; [expression] -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>if [expression] <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.current_page = Inventory</span><br/><br/>then,<br/><br/>-&gt; add new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; [expression] -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>set variable <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.parent.options</span> = [expression] <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">NewStringDictionary()</span><br/><br/>-&gt; add new script -&gt; 'add to dictionary' Script -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>Add to dictionary <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.parent.options</span> Key [expression] <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.previous_page.name</span> [EditorScriptsVariablesvalue] [expression] <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">player.previous_page</span><br/><br/>and lastly, you also of course got to setup the 'current_page' and 'previous_page' Attributes on your 'player' Player Object, unless you can go into the code directly and know how to work with it, this means that you're going to need to use your first page, to set these Attributes on your 'player' Player Object. Hopefully, you won't get an error at the start of your game... if you do... let me know... as this would mean the 'on enter page' Script in the Game Object is running before your first page's scripts are setting the 'current_page' and 'previous_page' Attributes (which the 'on enter page' needs to be already created/setup, hence the error, if there is one).<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>hopefully this will work for you..... leaving intact all of your normal page's links... only changing the Inventory Page links (so it is just a single link back to the page that you came from), which is hopefully what you wanted...",
