For future reference if I can't find something I mean.\r\n\r\nYou can always look at the HTML of the game while it's playing. there's dozens of element roles and hundreds of CSS classes that might be used for different things, but most of their names are self explanatory.\r\n\r\nThis won't help with anything within the map, though. The map is an image, generated by (I think) a canvas powered by Paperscript. The existing code in `playercore.js` and `grid.js` doesn't set the font size of labels at all; it leaves it at the default. And modifying those functions will be very difficult because in user-side scripts, you are outside the context where those functions were created.\r\nI suspect the best way to change the font size would be to replace `gridApi.drawLabel` with a new function which first calls the original, then looks at the end of the `allPaths` list to find the newly added text, and changes its size. This would be really ugly, but would theoretically allow live modification of the currently displayed map.",
