(Without all of the quest affiliation for lack of a better term?)\r\n\r\nWell...\r\n\r\nQuest-JS actually converts a compiled Quest game file (.quest) into a website. The website uses Java to run the interpreter (probably more complicated than that, just keeping it simple). So, what Quest-JS actually outputs is a website folder, which includes an HTML file, along with a bunch of .css files and .js files.\r\n\r\nNOTE: From what I can tell, Quest-JS compiled websites won't load the game if you have the panels activated. (Inventory, Compass, etc.)\r\n\r\nQuestKit (or Quest 6) seems to need to be hosted from a server to do anything. (I haven't tried to run it. That's just what the README said. I can't get 'npm install' to do anything. It just throws errors. I don't even know if QuestKit is actually functionable, though, so I didn't try very hard to get it up and running.)\r\n\r\nWeb2Executable is going to change your 2MB website into a 150MB app, and it won't even be an EXE file, it'll be something your average PC user couldn't figure out how to open.\r\n\r\nIt seems that PhoneGap will turn a website folder into an iOS or Android app, but I'm still setting it up, so I'm not certain yet.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go 'all coding', you can write your game using TADS. You can make an .exe file straight from that program when publishing your game.\r\n\r\nYou could also use Inform 7 to compile your game to Glulx or Z-machine, which can be played with Frotz or Gargoyle.

The website uses Java to run the interpreter (probably more complicated than that, just keeping it simple). So, what Quest-JS actually outputs is a website folder, which includes an HTML file, along with a bunch of .css files and .js files.</p>\n<p>NOTE: From what I can tell, Quest-JS compiled websites won't load the game if you have the panels activated.
