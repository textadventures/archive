      "EditableText": "Sometime in the early 80s my dad returned home from shopping one Saturday afternoon. He'd bought an Acorn Electron Home Computer. I was a bit miffed initially, as all my mates had a ZX Spectrum, but then I discovered something called text adventures, and I was utterly hooked. Now it was my dad's turn to be miffed, as he didn't agree with all these silly games and kept reminding me the thing had been bought for educational purposes.\n\nMemories fade, however, as I'm sure you're all aware, and I'm wondering if anyone could help bring those 'lost' games back to mind.\n\nI distinctly remember one called Twin Kingdom Valley, which has stuck with me because it was the first text adventure I'd played that had pictures! Thinking back, the images were awful and took about three minutes to render, but it was a wonderful novelty at the time.\n\nAnother title I remember was The Skull... and then there was Quill, of course, a piece of software that allowed to create your own games.\n\nHowever, the title of my absolute favourite text adventure completely escapes me. I remember the cover for the cassette tape was all black and moody. I think they were going for a film noir look, as you played a detective in the game. It was just amazing and enthralled me more than any conventional arcade game ever did.\n\nIf it's any help in jogging memories, I remember getting stuck at a railway station early on in the game... going round and round in circles until I discovered I had to go up onto the bridge crossing over the track and 'jump' onto the train as it passed, thus taking me to the next location.\n\nI would love to read your own memories, and any help identifying the above would be welcome too.",
