I'm planning on using this mainly for scenery-type objects, so there wouldn't really be a bunch of them, just they would show up in many different rooms when you attempted to interact with them (such as looking at them). For example, say there are vines growing along the walls of many rooms. I want to make it so that using &quot;look at vines&quot; or &quot;take vines&quot; ect would give the same response in more than one room (but not every room) without creating multiple copies of the vines object.",
