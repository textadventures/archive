I'm mostly done, but it would be VERY helpful for me to be able to output a file or text containing their purchases.  I've tried directly cutting and pasting and it just crashes my writing program.\n\nSo, I'm wondering if there's any way I can do that?\n\nThe one idea that I've had is using the Log.  However, the text I want to copy is the room description from the final room; so, when I try to put room.description into the Log it returns an error.  When I do ToString(room.description) it just adds the code from room.description, not the text the player sees.\n\nIt's been really vexing me.\n\nThanks.",
