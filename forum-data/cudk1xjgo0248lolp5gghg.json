People do not go looking around on the internet for Interactive Fiction creators, or even IF games in general for the most part.  But they do constantly look on their phone for apps (Or Steam for free games and or game creators) and even if not for IF in particularly, inevitably this would come across their choices at some point and they would most likely at least give it a chance.  Plus it being as a phone app (and or on Steam), it would have the full functionality of the desktop version and no need to try to do work arounds on the web version, as nice as it may be.\r\n\r\nNot to derail this thread completely, but perhaps Starve could \"ask\" the teacher of that particular PC or someone more positive towards that person of a higher rank in the school, if they would consider allowing the OK for the desktop version to be implemented onto the computer(s).  I have always felt that this can be used as a teaching tool for English or art in schools.  As a teaching aid for certain classes in either video game design, story writing or critical thinking and have fun while doing it.\r\n\r\nMost schools had other things that were only or mostly just games on their PCs like The Oregon Trail, The Carmen Sandiego series, math games, even Commander Keen and the majority just had a little history teaching or geography lessons thrown in..  (The last one, Keen was just a game and to this day I am still not sure why it was on the PCs and we as kids were allowed to play it. ^^! )  At least with Quest you can build something from the ground up, unless all you do is \"play\" other's games.  Still I think if you present the teaching, learning and creating element positively and make that the focus, give them time to read up and learn about the program, they would most probably allow for it.  It would not hurt to ask at least.  And I would leave out the part about the online version when you speak to them, as they may just tell you to use that instead...",
