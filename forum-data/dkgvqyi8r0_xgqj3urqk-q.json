Neither has happened. I don't know if it's the moderators testing the game or some kind of restriction thing or some weird rule about not being able to change the name, but I'd really like to just delete this listing so I can upload the demo without breaking the rule of only uploading new games. Because it this point it seems this listing it permanently stuck as an unfinished beta inaccessible to the public instead of just a lame demo to garner interest.\r\n\r\nCould I contact a moderator/admin/higher power of the website and ask that it be removed?",
