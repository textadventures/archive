In fact I will release a free EP of dreamy synthwave (in the vein of Tycho, M83, Com Truise) when I release the game. The game and EP will go hand in hand building from the 80s sci-fi atmosphere.\n\nEven though the game works in my laptop. When I put it as private online, it didn't work at all. I think there is a problem with the end scenes of code but I don't know what has gone wrong. I have cleaned out problems along the way but I can't work this out.\n\nI was wondering if there would be anyone out there who would be willing to look over the code, particularly in the 'final room of the game to work out the bugs. There are 18 rooms in total to give you an understanding of the game size. \n\nCheers.",
