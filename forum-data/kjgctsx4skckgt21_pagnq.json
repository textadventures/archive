      "EditableText": "So let's say I wanted to have the protagonist of my game pick up a Key and a Stick. My original idea was to just make duplicates of all the rooms (except with them now acknowledging you had a Key and/or Stick when you were to enter, say, a room with a Locked Door in it), but after some thinking  I've realized that I'd need to make well over 200 copies of the entire map, since some parts of the game would need you to be holding more than one item at a time. This would take a loooong time, and I'm really not good at coding at all which makes matters worse. So I was hoping someone could somehow explain to me how to make a proper inventory system, that would make certain rooms acknowledge items or prompt them to be used, as well as removing/keeping them after use. Thanks if you can.",
