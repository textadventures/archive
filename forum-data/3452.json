      "EditableText": "Hi!  I'm relatively new to this program and I've been able to figure out most of how to make a game on my own, but there has been one obstacle that I haven't been able to get around: how do you make it so a command has a different answer depending on whether a previous command has been given by the player.  For example, my player starts the game lying down.  If the player tries to say &quot;look around,&quot; I want the game to tell them that they cant -- that they need to stand up first.  And after they &quot;stand up,&quot; when they then type &quot;look around,&quot; I want to describe their surroundings.  Is there any way to have conditional commands?  Where the response is dependent on whether or not the player has given other commands first?  Thanks!",
