With these three features, a sample game would preferably allow you to attack something, gain experience, level, then allocate a stat or two.\n\nI honestly only threw those 3 suggestions out because they are what most people post threads asking about and having an easily accessible script doing the basic functions of those 3 things for new users to copy/paste/modify easily, might somehow rid us of those repetitive posts.\n\nAlso, a better sample game, would be a game first instructing people on ASL or QDK use, then quizzing them on what they've learned. Have the ASL/QDK lesson go by the Manual that way almost everybody would read the basics of the manual, and most likely have a better understanding of the syntax before asking stupid questions.",
