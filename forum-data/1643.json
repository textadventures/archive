I want to start trying to figure this all out and have downloaded QDK.  I have gone through the tutoria, yet still feel rather lost on how to use some of the techniques to its full advantage.\r\n\r\n  I was wondering if any of you have any good exercises or practices that i could try out that would help me learn some of the basics a little better, such as when and how to you a boolean vs a procedure or what not.\r\n\r\n  If you have any, let me know and I'll tell you if I figured it out, or if I hate you all and want to dig my eyes out with a spoon.  Either way it should be fun...and educational.",

You need to learn by trial and error.  Does it work?  Doesn't it work?  What happens if I...?  I try to give the easiest explanations as possible, as you've read, because I've been there before, and know you're not going to understand some advanced jargon.  I've answered a post in &quot;Creating Games&quot; (a recent one) entitled something like &quot;Fishes in a pond&quot;.  Open that post up and you'll see my post in logical form explaining how to create a pond with fishes that can be caught a percentage of the time.  It uses some more advanced features, and you should be able to extrapolate some other ideas from it.  Don't get disgruntled, but don't rely on everyone else to do it for you either (not that you have).  Good luck.  Tell me how the fishing went.",
