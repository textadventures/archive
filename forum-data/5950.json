I know I can search for things with the built-in search option, but it would be nice to find a room AND the objects in that room quickly.  For me, I bounce around from room to room to edit, correct, reference rooms (or things in them) constantly.  Of course, I have NO IDEA how difficult this would be or if it is even possible.\n\nJust a thought.",
