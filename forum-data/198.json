Games must not be based upon works currently under copyright unless permission is obtained from the copyright holder. You may parody established works, but you may not, for example, write a game based on Terry Pratchett's Discworld without permission. This avoids the entire issue of copyright and the ethics involved. \n\n2. Do not use copyrighted multimedia assets (graphics or sound) without permission from the copyright owner. This is especially important for MIDI files, as many web sites have MIDI versions of copyrighted songs available for download. If you don't know if a song, sound file, or picture is under copyright, don't use it. \n\n3. All entries must be freeware or public domain. Do not enter a game unless you are willing to give it away. No shareware, donorware, commercial products, etc. may be entered. \n\n4. All entries must be previously unreleased at the opening of voting. If an entry has previously been circulated, it will be disqualified. Translations of previously-released works are not considered to be unreleased. If you are unsure whether your game fails to meet this rule, please ask me. Note that this rule does not prevent you from having your game tested by a few beta-testers. \n\n5. Authors of a competition entry may not discuss any of the entries in a public Internet forum during the voting period. Once the competition has begun, do not post your thoughts on your entry or anyone else's on a newsgroup or bulletin board until the deadline for voting has passed. \n\n\nSo it looks like you can discuss your game all you want but only before the voting period starts. And as that's not till August 2004 you've got eight months to talk about your game all you want.  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->",
