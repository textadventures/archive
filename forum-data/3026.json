For some objects, reading should have the same effect as looking at the object so that &quot;read sign&quot; is the same as &quot;look at sign&quot;.  Is there a simple way to redirect the read verb on a specific object to run the lookat command.  This will save the aggro of having to include the same text for twice, once for the look at and once for the read commands?",
