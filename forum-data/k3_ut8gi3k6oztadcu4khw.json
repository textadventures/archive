This is the code:\r\n```\r\nx = 0\r\nforeach (o, GetDirectChildren(player)) {\r\n  if (GetBoolean(o, \"worn\")) {\r\n    x = x + 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nreturn (x)\r\n```\r\nHowever, when I try to access it I get an error message saying 'Error running script: Error compiling expression 'NumWorn()': Value cannot be null.Parameter name: key'. What am I doing wrong? It seems that no matter what the player is wearing, the result of the function should be an integer - so why is it being seen as null?\r\n",
