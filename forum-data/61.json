Obviously you need to rework all the default messages in Quest to French equivalents too. More important, my vague recollections os studying the French language as a schoolboy (a long time ago and I never achieved any level of competence, so I might be entirely wrong here) is that the very structure of French is different enough to make just a literal word for word translation appear very stilted and clumsy - am I right on that?\n\nI have a sneaking feeling that you'll need to replace almost all of Quest's inbuilt commands with new user commands that are tailored to give responses in anything approaching decent French.\n\nMy own 'typelib.qlb' alread replaces most of Quest's inbuilt commands anyway, so if you are willing to provide the 'conversion to decent french' expertise, I'm willing to attempt a French language version of that library, and add to it the remaining Quest inbuilt verbs.\n\nAl",
