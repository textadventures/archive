When they bring that food to their home, they can add it to their pantry; where it stops being an object and becomes a variable instead. (You have x days worth of food, with each item equalling one increase.)\n\nSo, I just made an object for food to find, which is then cloned. There's then a verb on it which, when used in the right room back home, removes the item and increases the food count. But there's the problem; I can't just have it say 'RemoveObject (Food)', because the item created isn't Food, it's Food1, then Food2 and so on and so forth for every new piece of food the player finds.\n\nIs there something I can slip into the brackets of RemoveObject (Object) that just makes it automatically apply to the item the verb is being used on? In essence, RemoveObject (Self) or whatever. I'm pretty sure i've seen something like that mentioned but can't for the live of me remember what it is; i'm assuming that when you create take/drop on an object, it must use this. Hopefully i'm not wrong, I can work around this but it'd be a bit of a pain. Any ideas?",
