The Pen and the Dark ) I just think it would be cool to try and rejuvenate and redo it but I'm having a hell of a game of either trying to get hold of the storybook of it that came with the game or the game itself. I just can't remember the whole story. It was about a column of dark energy left behind the some aliens many years ago and the unorthodox engineers on a distant world had to find out all about its contra energy. Hope you recall it too may be throw some ideas in the pot for someone to pick it up.
