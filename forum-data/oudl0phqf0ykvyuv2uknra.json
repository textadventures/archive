Each page has a place where you type and link the options for the next page.\r\n\r\nI am using the Text Adventure mode for making Gamebooks, what means I dont have this same mechanic, but the Text Adventure mode gives us plenty of more scripting option to play with. The solution I found actually double helped me.\r\n\r\nI use rooms as pages of a gamebook and use the choices as objects in the room. The \"Take\" function actually has a script moving the object \"player\" no the next \"room\", wich is actually a page in the book. \r\n\r\nThis method is helping me a lot, because I can use the \"Look at\" button to show the details for each choice without having to include a \"wall of text\" to the main text, allows the player to just ignore option where the heading doesn't sounds interesting at the moment and also brings a dynamic of increasing the number of \"player clicks\", adding the sensation of interaction to the gamebook. It has been working for me. Perhaps works fr you too.",
