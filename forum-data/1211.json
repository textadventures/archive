I decided to download the Age of Empires III demo this morning (right now in the US) from [url=http&#58;//www&#46;agecommunity&#46;com/all_downloads&#46;aspx:j5h8tg5j]here[/url:j5h8tg5j].\nIt's a 426MB download which would normally take like an hour or so if you're downloading around 50KB per second.  I was downloading and looking on the Axe forums when I looked down to see that I had already downloaded 50%.  When I looked at the download window, it showed I'm downloading at 770KB per second!!!!!\nMaybe I'm easily amazed.  Has anyone ever downloaded something that fast before?\nOh, time to end my post, I just downloaded the remaining 30% or so that was left while I was typing this post!",
