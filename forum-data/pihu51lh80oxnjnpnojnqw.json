This is about the Desktop version of Quest.\r\n\r\nSo, this is just a thing that came to my mind recently: Why is there no night mode for the Quest editor? Since i'm occupied in the morning and the afternoon, i tend to work on my projects in the late evening, as many here surely do as well.\r\n\r\nBut the interface of the Quest editor is in very bright white colours.\r\n\r\nWhy can't we change this? Isn't there a way to \"mod\" Quest? It could be as simple as defining different colours for the background, font and icons.\r\n\r\nJust felt like sharing this though.",
