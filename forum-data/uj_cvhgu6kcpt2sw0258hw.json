I have few questions on issues that I've been struggling with.\r\n\r\n1) I know I can add additional verbs (\"Stare at...\" \"Examine...\") but can I change or delete defaults like \"Look at\" or \"Take\"?\r\n\r\n2) I'm having difficulty with using an object on another object.  If the player is carrying Object 1, there is a \"Use\" button under the inventory, however how could I get a list of items to appear that the player could use/try to use Object 1 on?  Or, could the player click \"Use\" for Object 1 and a list of all the objects in the room would be printed for them to select which one they used Object 1 on?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
