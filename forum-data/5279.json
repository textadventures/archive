By that, I mean items that are marked as scenery only and are intended to add nothing more than depth.  Example:  I have a garage with different vehicles.  I'd like the player to be able to look at the different parts of the car although they aren't relevant to game completion.  Is this a distraction?  Sometimes I think it's like having extra pieces to a jigsaw puzzle... I add it because I HATE the 'you can't see that' response even though it is obvious it should be there.\n\n2.  On a similar note... How do you feel about essential game parts that are marked as scenery.  Example:  I have a tank in one room.  There is a door on the tank that needs opened.  I do not have the door in the objects pane or listed in the room description, just the tank only.  When you look at the tank, you get a description of the tank and its six parts, one of which is the door.  The player must open that door for a needed item.  Is this misleading or are you okay with games that OCCASIONALLY do this?",

It's definitely good to avoid the &quot;you can't see that&quot; response for stuff that the room description mentioned.\n\nI think you're right that scenery/atmosphere stuff can effectively be accidental red herrings. You could do some things to help the player distinguish puzzle elements from scenery, but I think several of those options detract from immersion somewhat, so you have to pick one to prioritize. I think players that want an immersive adventure experience won't mind the lack of clarity too badly. I mean, it's not like real-life magically flags all objects based on how important they are to your current objective. (If it did, I'd have an easier time finding keys in the morning!  <!-- s:( --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /><!-- s:( --> ) In games with graphics, there's not always a clear distinction between puzzle elements and decorations, other than [i:3gfhiywh]maybe[/i:3gfhiywh] whether your mouse cursor changes over certain objects. (But, heck, think of Skyrim, which is filled with irrelevant cookware, baskets, etc. that you can pick up and useless NPCs you can get a randomly selected line of dialog from.)\n\nIdeas for clarifying puzzle elements versus scenery:\nShort undetailed messages on objects that can't taken will probably give the player the impression something isn't important. Likewise if multiple things share a non-specific message (e.g. you made one scenery object with a bunch of different aliases). You could have a message explicitly saying something isn't important, but if your game has any kind of attempt at story or immersion, you probably want to avoid messages that break the fourth wall, like &quot;that's not something you need to be concerned about in the course of this game.&quot; I think it's not as bad if you have the character controlled by the player deciding the item isn't important. If you do want long descriptions full of &quot;flavor text,&quot; I'm guessing that very detailed descriptions of appearance have a higher likelihood of being mistaken as a hint, especially if any numbers or patterns are mentioned. I don't think I'd look too hard for hints in non-tangible descriptions, e.g. &quot;x postcard&quot; makes the PC start reminiscing about a past vacation, &quot;x paperwork&quot; brings up a description of what a slave-driving jerk the PC's boss is, etc.\n\n2. It might depend on the execution. If your game has (clearly visible) hyperlinks and the door mentioned in the tank description has a link, that should be no problem. Otherwise, in the example you gave, if it doesn't seem like the tank has multiple openable parts, I'd probably try typing &quot;open tank.&quot; If it gave a generic &quot;you can't open that&quot; message, I'd probably assume the tank can't be opened and try to move on to something else. Then I'd feel pretty annoyed upon finding out that what I had to do was indeed opening (the door of) the tank. But if &quot;open tank&quot; gives a message like, &quot;only the door of the tank can be opened&quot; then I'd probably try &quot;open tank door.&quot; That wouldn't work for people who like to push the buttons, but I don't think I've encountered any games on this site that can be beaten without typing, so those people are probably used to it.",
