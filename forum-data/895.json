First, I tried using the property of the objects.  I made the table with property cost=100.  I can't really do much with it.  So then I made it \"if #@object# = table\" which seems to work for me.  HOWEVER, I added an else msg to not allow him to purchase if the amount of money is less than 100.  What happens instead is that even if the player has 500, it still produces the message that he doesn't have enough.  \nAm I writing this wrong?
