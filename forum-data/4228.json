Only problem I can see is that there won't be a nice way for the player to always be able to see their stats without me copy/pasting it onto every page.\n\nIs there a way to enable a status bar in gamebook mode, sort of like what the text adventure version has?",

Would an easier alternative be to do a &quot;Gamebook-like&quot; in standard mode, where you hide the input bar and output command links, etc, but you'd still have the power of the full mode?",
