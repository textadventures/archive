This allows me nearly everywhere to just not offer an options that do not work, so the user rarely gets messages like 'you can't do that'. One exception is the 'require another object' menus. They seem to offer all visible non-scenery objects in the room. Is there any way to exclude objects being shown there? Also, is there a way to add (specific) scenery objects there?",
