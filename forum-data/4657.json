      "EditableText": "I am looking for a few PC games of old.  I can not tell you how old the games actually are, except this was early 90's as I recall when I happened to see and or play them.  I also am not entirely sure if they were on a floppy or on cd, since they were not my games nor even my computer.\n\nThe first game is one where the best I can describe it is an adventure game of some sort.  You are in a car/vehicle blocky looking thing and you were traveling around the environment in which looked to be a desert.  I remember trying to get into buildings or through gates, but you needed certain key cards to gain access.  Also the creatures around you looked like dinosaurs...  The only cool looking thing about the game were the little conversational windows that would pop up and looked quite good for it's time.  They were drawn, as in not a video with real actors, but it was still good none the less.  (Or maybe I am thinking of the instruction manual...) Sorry it is about all I can remember of that game.\n\nThe second game is not much better, but I know it had to do with an RPG and in first person.  As in you moved and you could not see your hands or feet etc., just what ever was directly in front of you.  Upon starting the game I had a chance encounter with a flying goblin or devil something or other.  It asked me a question or initiated combat and I was given the choice of attacking, talking, running or giving it something and that something was dried milk or milk flakes or something or other.  I think the game revolved around portals and transporting through time.  I mention the milk flakes or what ever flakes they were, because it is an unusual object for a game to have that as an item.\n\nThe third game and this might very well of been on DOS or floppy was a simulation type game.  You started as a bug, maybe a spider and it was your quest to find your mate as it were.  The land was flat for the most part and you just basically kept moving until you found it.  Then you evolved into the next available species and all the way up to dogs and even human beings.  The graphics were horrible, but you got a sense of what was what.\n\nAnd finally there was a racing/obstacle course type game where you are on roller skates and trying to simply get from one end of the field to the other before the time runs out, going left to right.  You could jump over obstacles, skate over arrows that would either give you a temporary boots of speed or slow you down and oddly I think you gained points for kicking cans across the screen...\n\nSorry, I have had these recollections recently and all except for the last game do I have a hankering to find and play them.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.",
