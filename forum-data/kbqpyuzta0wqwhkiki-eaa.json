      "EditableText": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI´m new to QUEST (and coding in general) and working on my first game. Unfortunately , I´ve hit a brick wall.\r\n\r\nSo... I want to have an interactable oven that can hold multiple ingredients. The player should be able to change the temperature of the oven and leave the room, while the oven continues baking the food. If the ingredients are in the oven for too long, they burn. (If the variable **progress** of an ingredient reaches 0, it burns)\r\n\r\nWhat I did so far is this:\r\n\r\nI have an object called \"oven\" with the variable \"oven.temp = 10\"\r\n\r\nIf you put an item into the oven, this script runs:\r\n\r\n    SetObjectFlagOn (this, \"inoven\")\r\n    this.progress= GetRandomInt(75, 100)\r\n    MoveObject (this, oven)\r\n\r\nIn the background a turnscript is always running:\r\n\r\n    foreach (inoven, GetDirectChildren (oven)) {\r\n    this.progress = this.progress - oven.temp\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere is my problem. I don´t know what object I have to refer to. **this.progress** in the turnscript is wrong, I know that much. But how do I tell the game to look at each object individually and change its variables?\r\n\r\nI could just spam the turnscript with\r\n\r\n    if (GetBoolean(ingredient1, \"inoven\")) {....\r\n    if (GetBoolean(ingredient2, \"inoven\")) {....\r\n    if (GetBoolean(ingredient3, \"inoven\")) {....\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n\r\nbut there must be an easier way, that I just don´t know. I plan to add a lot of ingredients, so I´d like to avoid the **IF** spam.\r\n\r\nI have spent waaay too much time trying to figure that out on my own.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any help :)",
