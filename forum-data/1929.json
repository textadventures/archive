Eg: Statue Item1 on Statue1, Statue Item2 on Statue2, Statue Item3 on Statue3, create Reward Item.\n\nHow can I do this? If, Then, Else doesn't cover surfaces/containers, so it looks like I need code. Help meh pl0x!  <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->",
