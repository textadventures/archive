I started to stick with gamebook creation instead of text adventure creation. It was easier to figure out. I have read the manual a few times but i still didn't have the skills to make the game my own. \n\nI have a few questions that if answered might get me back into trying the software out again.\n\n1. What is the difference between Objects and Rooms\n\n2. How do I make a dialog menu between the player and npc's\n\n3. can the final product be played on a ds? or is it just mobile devices and computers?\n\nthank you for helping a newbie! XD",
