One way to do this would be to have the desk as a container that can be opened as closed, and the phone in the desk.\n\nIf you want it specifically in a drawer, I would put the drawer in the room, not in the desk. That way the room description will find the drawer, see it is a container, and so find the contents. You might want to mark the drawer as scenery; I think it will then only get listed after opening, but you may want to play around and see.",
