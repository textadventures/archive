I'm now in the position that I can't even take an alternative action as the wearables library has taken control over the 'remove' command meaning I can't use it but the wearables library one is bugged. If I try to remove the code by installing an empty wearables library the game refuses to load. I hope this is do-able as I'm knee deep in code. \n\nIf it isn't I'd strongly suggest people don't install ANY library unless it's 100% tested.",
