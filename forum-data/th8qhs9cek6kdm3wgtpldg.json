By the time things were complete, I could convert with QuestJS and only have to alter the html and css files for my needs. Previously some code chunks had to be shifted upwards in game.js\r\n\r\nNow that I am coming back to this stuff, I exported a game for conversion the other day and had all kinds of problems. Once I realized I was using the wrong version of QuestJS, I switched to the last one KV sent me (like 6.4.7 or something), and the game converted just fine, except for the Verblinks not working (and other hyperlinks). The game displays: \"I don't understand your command.\" whenever you click on one of those links. They worked before, but I cannot see why they are not working now.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where that particular code is or where it should be? Or perhaps there is something preventing the code from working...? (should I just use the latest QuestJS maybe? Or QEdit?)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n- Raist\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am glad development continued after KV finished helping me. :)",

Mainly items that were two or more words caused errors, and any _ASK_ functions could not be used, also _If/Else/Else If_ did not work. Everything else seemed to convert. However, without clearing the _ASK_ error, and any _If/Else/Else If_ statements I was unable to try out the game itself.\r\n\r\nIs that something you, or someone else, could offer some guidance with, and if so, would you like me to post the error(s) here or Github?\r\nOr would I be better off re-creating the whole game using Quest 6?\r\nOr am I on my own?\r\nOr some other option I did not think of?\r\n(What is your choice, Adventurer?
