      "EditableText": "Thanks for those with the help of telling me where to and how to look for sound files, I have tried different rooms and I am quite pleased with what I have found and have done so far.  However, at least from using freesounds.org anyway, although they have many sounds, not all is what I am looking for or need.  But with that already in mind, I had downloaded different sounds to use.\n\n  My plan was to play two or three or even more sound files at the same time so that they over lap and thus create the “ambiance” of what I need, but that is not working.  At least when using the built in Quest features, I can start a sound when entering a room and loop it and I can of course stop the sound (Hehehe... did not realize I had to do that manually the first time...), but I can not add two or more sound files to play simultaneously.  Or I should say I can not hear two or more sound files at the same time.  Why is that?\n\n  I think I read the answer some where, not sure where, I even did a search for it, but could not find it again.  I want to say someone said that Quest can only play one sound file at a time.  Is there a way to force a change either by code or some thing else?  I stack three scripts of entering room play sound, but only one (I want to say the last one, or maybe it was the first, definitely the one in the middle did not play.) sound file played.\n\n  Can Quest play more than one sound file at a time or am I going to have to take the sounds I have and edit them myself so they become “one” sound file and then I can use it?  And if that is the case, any idea how I am suppose to do that.  I have no editing skills sadly.  Thanks.",

I think I have a solution anyway in that I won't make my ambient track constant so it can be run with timers instead. That would also solve the looping problems: on my first test it played once and then gave up the fight, on my second the loop worked as it should but it has an annoying click between loops (not a problem at my end as it sounds seemless in my DAW).
