If the boulder is there, destroy the rock object (note that destory needs the name of the object, not the object itself, and the name of the clone will not be rock!).",

(or to see your entire game code, or to play your game, lol)<br/><br/>so, instead, don't have that scripting inside of the 'stone smash (or whatever it is called)' function, put it ALL inside of the 'foreach' Function:<br/><br/><pre><code>foreach (W, AllObjects ()) {<br/>  if (HasString (W, &quot;rock&quot;) = true) {<br/>    if (not Got(sharp stone)) {<br/>      IncreaseObjectCounter (sharp stone, &quot;volume&quot;)<br/>      AddToInventory (sharp stone)<br/>      msg (&quot;Pounding on the side of the boulder for a few seconds&lt;br/&gt;a chunk falls off leaving a perfect sharp stone, &lt;br/&gt;now to find a way to tie it to a handle&#46;&quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    else if (Got(sharp stone)) {<br/>      IncreaseObjectCounter (sharp stone, &quot;volume&quot;)<br/>      msg (&quot;Smashing rock against the boulder a chuck falls off leaving you a sharp stone&#46;&quot;)<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</code></pre><br/><br/>and I think your 'double' results have to do with the messing up of the:<br/><br/><pre><code>  if (HasString (boulder, &quot;rock&quot;) = true) {<br/>    if (boulder&#46;object_type_string = &quot;rock&quot;) {</code></pre><br/><br/>which, I've already adressed above.<br/><br/>otherwise, the 'double' (or times x, lol) results that you're getting, is from that the 'foreach' will execute it's scripts (if their conditions are met) for EVERY item in your list used (that meets those scripts' conditions).<br/><br/>for example:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;attr name=&quot;color_string&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;red&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;berry&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;attr name=&quot;color_string&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;lemon&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;attr name=&quot;color_string&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;yellow&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>game&#46;mylist = split (&quot;apple;berry;lemon&quot;, &quot;;&quot;)<br/><br/>foreach (K, game&#46;mylist) {<br/>  if (HasString (K, &quot;color_string&quot;) {<br/>    msg (&quot;color&quot;)<br/>    if (K&#46;color_string = &quot;red&quot;) {<br/>      msg (&quot;red apple&quot;)<br/>    } else if (K&#46;color_string = &quot;blue&quot;) {<br/>      msg (&quot;blue berry&quot;)<br/>    } else if (K&#46;color_string = &quot;yellow&quot;) {<br/>      msg (&quot; yellow lemon&quot;)<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}<br/><br/>outputs&#58;<br/><br/>color<br/>color<br/>color<br/>red apple<br/>blue berry<br/>yellow lemon</code></pre>",
