I would like to change the look of the gamebook I am creating... it seems that many of the other games I have been looking at have much better looks than the basic plain text that is the quest default. Can anybody help to explain to me how this is done? (also, if you have any suggestions please let me know, I am creating a sci-fi type game)\n\nThanks in advance!",

Because what you want to change dictates the answer for that specific aspect (whether it be font, font color, background image, link color, etc). You can't answer a question like this in general (apart from what Silver offered above).",
