I was hoping that it would only print the text \"There's writing on the paper here's what it reads....\" when the player has the paper and if not then it would go back to it's default description that the paper is on the ground.\r\n\r\nBrian",

      "EditableText": "You can use a text processor command inside an object's description. For example, your description could be: `{either Contains (player, sheet of paper):It's somebody's shopping list.|There is a sheet of paper lying on the ground.}`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the description for an object's description is stored in its `look` attribute. So if you want to change it permanently, just change that attribute. For example, if you allow the player to dip the piece of paper in water, you could include the script command:\r\n```\r\nsheet of paper.look = \"A damp piece of paper. The ink has run, rendering it illegible.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat simply changes the description, so the new one will appear every time the player looks at it, without needing an additional check. The new description can be either a string or a script.\r\n\r\nIf you are using in-room descriptions (which I mentioned in my other post), you might also want to change the `inroomdescription` attribute at the same time.",
