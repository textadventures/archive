So it seems that my saving it didn't achieve much and the data is just gone._\r\n\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nI was using the online editor, so I could work on it from a number of machines (work and home) and this morning noticed I had two instances available in my games. I deleted the one I believed was my old Quest instance, leaving my Squiffy instance with exactly the same name. However, upon hitting \"Edit Game\" it is completely empty. I was only in it this morning showing a colleague my progress, so not sure how it could've gone.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to retrieve the work I had done? It's only a few hours, but it's mostly that I had made a lot of progress actually learning the code and would like to refer back to it.\r\n\r\nIf I can get it back, I will save it to my Drive since I obviously can't trust the online editor/myself.\r\n\r\nThank you",
