I wasn't trying to prove anything to you, but a reply I had on the Twine forum mentioned something about certain browsers limiting history for html files run from a local hard-drive, and I wondered if it was only for me that the nav buttons were inactive. I'm using the latest desktop version of Twine and Sugarcube 2.11.0, which is the latest of that story format also.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is the answer I wanted. So far so good.\r\n\r\nWhat browser did you use, by the way?",
