A Save system is implemented, allowing a user who has admin access to that game to send a player (via my client) to an inaccessible room that will log all variables, etc. needed to save the game.\n4.

PK Squares will be red. (I sorta stole your idea, Ste, but I implemented it for YOUR use if you want it, since you said your game uses PK squares.\n\nSyntax won't be too hard to figure out. I'll include a help file when finished. Since I can't make an actual command (or can you?) I will have to make a custom msg that is intercepted by the client (game checks to see if the client is mine first) instead of being displayed by the player (soooo simple.. use the win32 message loop)\n\nAny ideas you may have will be welcome.
