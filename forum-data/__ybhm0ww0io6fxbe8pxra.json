      "EditableText": "So, some time ago I made a text-based game: https://adeptus7.itch.io/dominion\r\n\r\n\"Dominion of Darkness” is a RPG/strategy text game in which the player takes on the role of a Sauron-style Lord of Darkness with the goal of conquering the world. He will carry out his plans by making various decisions. He will build his army and send it into battles, weave intrigues and deceptions, create secret spy networks and sectarian cults, recruit agents and commanders, corrupt representatives of Free Peoples and sow discord among them, collect magical artifacts and perform sinister plots.\r\n\r\nAnd now I am thinking about making something more original - version for two people, playing hot-seat like it he Heroes of Might and Magic. So - one person reads his paragraph, makes decision, transfers computers to second person etc. One person would be Lord of Darkness, second leader of the Free People. Decisions of one person would have impact on the story of the sceond person.\r\n\r\nI think it is fun concept, it would enable a game of intrigue and deception of the enemy.... The problem is that I'm not sure people would be interested in something like that. It would be more difficult to play than interactive fiction for one person, for obvious reasons. That's why I want to ask gamers - if You would be interested in such game? Would You play something like that? It is it worthy developing?",
