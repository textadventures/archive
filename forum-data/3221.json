The picture shows at the top of the screen, and then the usual descriptive text of the room is displayed under it. \n\nThere is however, a fair amount of text and when the text is printed on the screen it takes scrolls the text down, and you need to scroll the page up to get to the start of the text.\n\nThere there a way to have the screen jump to the top of the text, or am I having to look at a smaler picture or smaller font? or Lump it?\n\nMany thanks again.",
