I was wondering if there's a way to make it so after an option is clicked, it remains an option until a certain series of events is carried out. e.g. if they go to a fountain before collecting a bucket, they cannot interact with the fountain, however if they go get the bucket and return to the fountain, they are now able to collect water. Thank you!",
