      "EditableText": "I still have a lot of work to do before my introduction version comes out but I do have a question about converting to the CAS file. When I first attempted to send you a copy of my fles Alex I was not quite sure what to send or how best to send it so I clicked export CAS in QDK. According to the manual I should have gotten an options window on where the file was going to be stored or where I wanted to store it but this never happened, the entire QDK game file simply dissapeared and nothing I did to try to locate it anywhere on my computer produced results. Luckily I had it backed up on flash and just reloaded it into QDK to continue work.  My question is - Where does the file normally go and how do I find it?  I dont see how I did anything wrong because that is exactly how the manual tells you to do it but I certainly cant upload it or release it in any way if I can not locate it after exporting to CAS.\nAlso, if I am listing picture files in my script as individual script, in other words there are no conditions or predetermined factors other than the appropriate action by the player in order for the pic to be called, do I need to list them manualy in resources before I compile?",

I am still getting internal error messages and absolutely can not understand why.  All of my pics are simple stand alone script -- the player types a command to an object, that objects script says to print a text and show a pic. The text prints but the pic does not appear, there is no rational explanation for this.  I never move them or change them in any way yet they continually want to go awol on me. I've got multi layered script in my story that never gives me any problems yet a simple show this pic now can't get its crap togeher.  What am I possibly overlooking!  Why can we not put the files directly into the game editor instead of pulling from external sources all the time?  Highly confused and annoyed, need help/options.",
