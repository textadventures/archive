I am making a gamebook for a concept game I have in mind, where, if you die, you get to see your stats and achievements you've made along the way.\r\nOne thing I've implemented is compare counter objects.

Doesn't. Save. This is the code I have in mind:\r\n\r\n    if (GetInt(game, \"riskTaker\") > GetInt(game, \"cautious\")) {\r\n    PrintCentered (\"[Achievement Earned: You were a Risk Taker.]<br/>\")\r\n    }\r\n    else if (GetInt(game, \"riskTaker\") < GetInt(game, \"cautious\")) {\r\n    PrintCentered (\"[Achievement Earned: You were Cautious.]<br/>\")\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n    //some other message I haven't decided on yet\r\n    } \r\n\r\nWhenever I type this in, with the second counter as an expression, it runs the game **once** perfectly, I might add - and then once I save the file a second time it disappears, giving me an error with the following words:\r\n\r\n    Could not set value '\"cautious\")' - The number of opening brackets \"(\" does not match the number of closing brackets \")\".\r\n\r\nThe whole first part seems to magically disappear.
