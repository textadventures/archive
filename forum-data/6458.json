However, i met the first problem with a bedroll.\n\nAs i hide the items, i need to place them as a description for the player. it cannot be at the room's description, as the player is able to take the bedroll. So, i found interesting if the Object:room would check if both the bedroll is in room and if it is not in player's inventory. This case would reveal the bedroll was inside the room, but as it is not in inventory, the room description should print a massage.\n\nHowever i don't know how check two conditions and only if both are ok, then get the result. Can the GUI do it?",
