I really appreciated.\r\n\r\nNow, let's go to the core of this topic. I decided using the framed picture on some pages, and realized that the text which were perfectly sized to fit on a single page is not working anymore. It demands me creating new intermediary pages and split the text again, now to house the framed pictures. However, an idea came to my mind. Is there any not hardly complex way of avoiding text to auto-scroll down to the end, so the player doesn't need to roll it back to start reading the page? I suppose it keeps the problem of scrolling the page down, but the player will not need scrolling up to start reading and then scroll down as he/she reads the page.",

By using the \"Look at\" button, the ame displays the relevant scene to the player. So, he/she may read the text first and then - if willing to - look at the relevant scene. It automatically gives the player an option of no graphics playing for safer situations, as i am working on an adult and sexual themed game.\r\n\r\nI decided adding this here because may become a tip for fellow developers.",
