Heres the question tho...under Insert Variable on 'add conditional', how do you set up your own strings?\n\n2: Working with numbers\n\nThis is all in QDK mind you...but in reference to the above, how would i set it up so that if their skill is greater than or equal to, say, 5, then they would get such and such a message? I know to use an if-then statement but after that I'm lost....I dont know how to do ranges. \n\nThanks in advance for the help. Pretty soon I'll actually know what I'm doing and you all won't have to put up with my silly questions!",
