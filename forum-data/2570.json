I don't like directly requesting some input from the player using a popup dialog (showmenu) ... but otherwise requesting input inline ... \n\nalthough, since 'showmenu' can be implemented DURING a script ... and the inline method for setting a variable using user input seems to require you to be in a room ... a startup script could greatly benefit for that method of getting input.",
