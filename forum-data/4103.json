I have also looked through the functions available in the script editor, but I can see nothing like &quot;use &lt;object&gt;&quot;, &quot;use &lt;object&gt; on &lt;object&gt;&quot; etc. Any ideas, anyone?",

The slightly longer but more efficient option is to make a new function, paste whatever &quot;use&quot; does right now into that, and then make both the &quot;drink&quot; verb and &quot;use&quot; just call it. I'm not aware of any way to make one verb call another without using a function.",
