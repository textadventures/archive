Phase with us now for this is the time of adventure.  I, Treguard, issue the challenge.  Beyond that portal lies the dungeon of deceit, which I alone have mastered but those of you who cross the boundaries of time must master it also.  The first is now without so… enter stranger!\n\nYour quest through the dungeon is for truth and justice.  Justice, of course, is blind and when you don this helmet, you’ll also become blind though you’ll find there’s just enough vision to find and examine objects directly beneath.  \n\nNow the dungeon ahead is an alien place, and so to sustain your progress a sprite of energy will travel with you.  It is your own life force and must be fed with food, which will be occasionally found on your quest.  On condition red, you are in great peril for this is no game for a player with numerous lives and when this one's done, your adventure is over.  \n\nTo feed your life force, you place any food in this knapsack.  But place only food there because any other objects will also be consumed.  You will of course find other objects on your quest, choose them and use them with care.  And remember, you may only carry two at a time.  \n\nNow, I'm constrained to offer you certain final warnings so listen to my words very carefully.  On your quest, I shall be with you and yet not with you for there are places in the dungeon where even I may not safely go.  The way to truth is tortuous, there is no correct route through the dungeon but the right path can be found using logic and guile.  The only way is onward, there is no turning back...\n\n\nListen most carefully, for the casting of even minor spells is a tickleish buisniess and must be performed according to the ritual, lest the magic misfires and the spell turn upon you.\n\nTo invoke the magic, one must call out in a loud, clear voice &quot;spellcasting&quot; followed by the letters of the spell in the right order.  Once used, some spells must be dismissed, lest the effects turn on the dungeoneer.
