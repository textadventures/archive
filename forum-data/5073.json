If you want to learn to code, quest is really awesome for it). Code is indeed very scary at first, but as you slowly start to learn it, it's really not that difficult (it's really just a lot of algebra: algebraic substitutions, but coming up with creative~advanced code designs, that's hard, lol. But just the coding itself, isn't really as bad as it certainly does seem for people new to code).

If you want to learn to code, quest is really awesome for it). Code is indeed very scary at first, but as you slowly start to learn it, it's really not that difficult (it's really just a lot of algebra: algebraic substitutions, but coming up with creative~advanced code designs, that's hard, lol.
