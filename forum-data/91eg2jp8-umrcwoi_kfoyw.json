I guess the way to do this would be to have a variable GotSet which increases by one when one of the items is taken, with a check to see when it reaches 5.  I've tried various ways of doing this using Variables and Attributes, but can't make it work.  Can anyone help please?",

      "EditableText": "There are a few ways to go about this. Personally, I would use a turn script to do what you want. If they are five specific items, I would forget about variables and do a simple check to see if the player has all five objects in their inventory. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (Got(First_Object) and Got(Second_Object) and Got(Third_Object) and Got(Fourth_Object) and Got(Fifth_Object)) {\r\n  msg (\"You have collected all five items in the set.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf, however, they don't have to be specific items, just of a certain category, I would give all the collectable items a flag (Boolean attribute, true), and check to see if the player has a total of five. If you gave them a flag of \"collectable,\" then this should work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSet = 0\r\nforeach (item, ScopeInventory()) {\r\n  if (GetBoolean(item, \"collectable\")) {\r\n    Set = Set + 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nif (Set = 5) {\r\n  msg (\"You have the complete set.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf it is possible to have six or more items, you might want to change Set=5 to Set>4 in the above script.\r\n\r\n",
