If the player has a script attribute named `changedvodka`, it will be run every time their `vodka` attribute changes. This is the standard way to prevent a counter (such as health) going over a maximum or under a minimum. So you could make the script something like:\r\n```\r\nif (this.vodka < 0) {\r\n  this.vodka = 0\r\n}\r\nelse if (this.vodka = 0) {\r\n  msg (\"You have run out of vodka.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to make a function. This gives you the benefits of being able to check whether the player has enough vodka before letting them use the command, while also meaning that you don't need to replicate the same code.\r\n\r\nHope that makes some sense.",
