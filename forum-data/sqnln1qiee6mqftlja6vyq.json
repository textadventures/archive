I want the player to start with coins that can be spent on \"books\" that tell the player what they need to know about a topic. This way, the player can decide whether they want to utilize this, or they can decide that they want to play the game without the \"hints\". The coins will not be spent on anything else throughout the game, but I want the \"shop\" option thing to be able to be accessed at any point in the game.\r\n\r\nIs this possible? If so, how?\r\n\r\nI would like to note that I understand how coding works, but I'm new to Quest, so I don't really know where to put things. If someone could explain it to me like I'm a toddler, that would be great and very much appreciated.",
