      "EditableText": "YES!\r\n\r\nWhat you are looking for is the command text option. When creating your text, it looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{command:NameOfTheCommand:WordsPlayerSees}\r\n```\r\nIt creates a hyperlink of WordsPlayerSees that, when clicked, executes command NameOfTheCommand.\r\n\r\nSo you want a command called, I don't know, 'GoToRandomRoom', with word-input '12345'. Then you structure it like:\r\n```\r\n{command:12345:Click Me!}\r\n```\r\nUnder that commands, you basically use a Switch block, switching based on a GetRandomInt. It'd look something like this (Pardon my psuedocode):\r\n```\r\nSwitch Case (GetRandomInt(1,5)){:\r\ncase 1{\r\nMove Player to room1\r\n}\r\ncase2{\r\nMove Player to ToothbrushRoom\r\n}\r\ncase3{\r\nMove Player to room3\r\n}\r\netc.\r\n```\r\nTo instead make a list of possible ones, you instead want to use menu:\r\nFirst create a blink Stringlist\r\nAdd the possible options to it\r\nShow the menu, with a Switch-case inside.\r\n\r\nLike so:\r\n```\r\nWhateverYouWantToCallTheNewStringList = newStringList()\r\n\r\nAdd to WhateverYouWantToCallTheNewStringList \"Option 1\"\r\nAdd to WhateverYouWantToCallTheNewStringList \"Option 2\"\r\n\r\nShow Menu based on WhateverYouWantToCallTheNewStringList{\r\nafter input:\r\nSwitch Case based on result{\r\ncase \"Option 1\"{\r\nMove player to room99\r\n}\r\ncase \"Option 2\"{\r\nMove player to GameOverRoom\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHope this helps!",
