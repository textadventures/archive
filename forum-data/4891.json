      "EditableText": "I've now learned how to use the command link to create a hyperlink in the room description, but only to do simple things like move a player. But how would I use it to trigger the use of an object?\n\nLet's say I have a password system on a computer. The player types '&gt;use computer' and they get the message:\n\n[b:1h67nout]Logging in. Please wait...\n\nEnter password\n&gt;[/b:1h67nout]\n\nThe player enters the correct password and it triggers whatever. But if they enter an incorrect one, I print the message:\n\n[b:1h67nout]Incorrect password entered | Try again\n&gt;[/b:1h67nout]\n\nWhere [b:1h67nout][i:1h67nout]Try again[/i:1h67nout][/b:1h67nout] is a hyperlink. I want that hyperlink to trigger the same action as typing 'use computer' does.\n\nHow would I do that?",
