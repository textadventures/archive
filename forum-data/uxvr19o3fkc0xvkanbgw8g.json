A quick fix is to go into this file:\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Quest 5\\Core\\CoreDevMode.aslx\r\n\r\nAnd delete lines 100 and 101, which look like this:\r\n```\r\n  <javascript src=\"DevMode/tabulator.min.js\" />\r\n  <javascript src=\"DevMode/debugtable.js\" />\r\n```\r\nThat will allow the publish process to proceed. However, I then found I could not upload the game, and I have yet to establish why. I am hoping it is just that the uploader has not been updated to allow ASL version 580, which would be trivial to adjust (though outside my permission domain).\r\n\r\nThis is the second update to Quest since Alex quit, and the previous one hardly changed the infrastructure at all (so the ASL version was still 550). This one has raised various issues... it does not help that Luis handle textadventures.co.uk, so does the online side (and will see the error message about why the uploaded failed) whilst I handle the Quest code, and SoonGames wrote the DevMode code. None of us have the full picture in the way Alex did, nor half the experience of Quest. We are getting there, but it is a bumpy ride.\r\n\r\nAssuming you are not using any new features from 5.8, I would suggest going back to 5.7 to publish your game. You will need to edit the second line of the game file in a text editor to this before opening it in Quest 5.7:\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n```\r\n",
