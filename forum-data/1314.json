I finally got the inventory to save but am stuck on how to save player location. Every time I disconnect I get put right back in the start room. I have tried to move the player to quest.lastroom but that didnt work.\n\nAlso am having trouble with a runtime error 10 when I change certain status variables to local instead of global. Get an error saying 'that array is locked' only happens with variables for features not for stats for example race locks it while strength doesnt. How can I make these local without crashing it?\n\nAnd last I need to know how portable is a game made with QDK? Can it only run on questnet with the quest program or could it run on any server with any client?\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide.",
