Select \"General\" from this menu you can remove the site. After clicking \"Delete this site,\" confirm your choice. The actions may vary depending on the hosting, but the principle is the same. I don't know about games; I mostly only play Meinkrafat; I think you've heard of it, you can look here for new servers if you're interested https://minecraft.buzz/, but it should work. As far as I know, you can't delete the website completely; it's archived so that you can restore it later. I'd be glad if it helped you! ",
