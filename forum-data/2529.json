If i for example have an item called &quot;pistol&quot;. I  change it so i can pick it up in the inventory panel and I make a message appear when I pick it up, for example, &quot;you pick up the gun&quot; Now I enter the game and type take gun, it says &quot;you pick up the gun&quot; but it doesn't move to my inventory! \nYes i have changed the objekt &quot;gun&quot; so it is takeable and Is supposed to move automaticly to my inventory  when i type &quot;take gun&quot; but it doesnt move to my inventory.What am I doing wrong? Please answer with common words, because im new to this game and don't understand all the terms in the game and I'm not from an english talking country.",
