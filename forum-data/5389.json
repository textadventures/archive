But when I type &quot;jump&quot; in to the game, it just reads &quot;You jump, but nothing happens.&quot; But if I write &quot;jump self&quot; it runs it just fine and ends the game. I've only just started at this this morning, and have been on it for most of today, so I'm still getting the hang of it. Any tips on how to have these basic player verbs work out without typing &quot;self&quot;? Thanks!",
