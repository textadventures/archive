The only problems are these:\r\n* Quest's Interface is okay, but I would really prefer writing my game in a text editor. I know Quest uses an XML-based programming language (ASL) under the hood, so I may be able to write my games the old fashioned way. Is there any documentation for the ASL language?\r\n* I would prefer not to reinvent the wheel if I can help it (as far as combat and the like), is there a decent library supporting combat (preferably D20-based)?",
