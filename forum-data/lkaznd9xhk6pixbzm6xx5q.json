      "EditableText": "So I'm creating  a quest system which has 4 parts.\r\n**-Pending:** You've found the quest but are too low of a level to start it.\r\n**-Unlocked:** You are now a high enough level to start this quest, return to the Npc/object who gave it to you.\r\n**-Inprogress:** You are now in a gamestate where collecting X or doing X will add to your quest progress.\r\n**-Completed:** You have completed doing/collecting X, return to the Npc or object who gave you quest for reward.\r\n**-Done:** You have finished every step in this quest.\r\n\r\nI also have a Quest Book the player carries around which displays the progress of different quests you've found/completed.\r\n\r\nSo now for the rough part, I apologize in advance.\r\n\r\nI am currently using 2 functions to set booleans which add to and remove from the lists in the quest book. The first one checks attriubutes of a quest and turns the booleans on or off. Here it is.\r\n**CheckProgess Function:** Takes \"quest\"\r\n```\r\nif (quest.qstep = (quest.qstepmax + 1)) {\r\n  if (quest.done = true) {\r\n    msg (\"You've already completed this quest<br/>\")\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    quest.completed = false\r\n    quest.inprogress = false\r\n    quest.unlocked = false\r\n    quest.pending = false\r\n    quest.done = true\r\n    msg (\"You have finished a quest. Well done!<br/>\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (quest.qstep = quest.qstepmax) {\r\n  if (quest.completed = false) {\r\n    quest.inprogress = false\r\n    quest.unlocked = false\r\n    quest.pending = false\r\n    quest.completed = true\r\n    msg (\"You have completed a quest. Return to its giver for a reward.<br/>\")\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"You hear crickets\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (quest.qstep > 1 and quest.qstep < quest.qstepmax) {\r\n  if (quest.inprogress = false) {\r\n    quest.unlocked = false\r\n    quest.pending = false\r\n    quest.inprogress = true\r\n    msg (\"You have started a new quest.<br/>\")\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"The wind blows.<br/>\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (player.lvl >= quest.lvl) {\r\n  if (quest.unlocked = false) {\r\n    quest.unlocked = true\r\n    quest.pending = false\r\n    msg (\"You have unlocked a new quest.<br/>\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (ListContains(ScopeVisible(), quest)) {\r\n  if (quest.pending = false) {\r\n    quest.pending = true\r\n    msg (\"You have a new pending quest.<br/>\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe second one Adjusts the variables of the quest and displays a string that is set in the quest attributes. Here it is.\r\n**QuestCheck Function:** Takes \"quest\"\r\n```\r\nif (quest.done = true) {\r\n  msg (quest.donestring)\r\n  quest.started = false\r\n}\r\nelse if (quest.completed = true) {\r\n  msg (quest.completedstring)\r\n  reward (quest)\r\n  quest.qstep = quest.qstepmax + 1\r\n}\r\nelse if (quest.inprogress = true) {\r\n  msg (quest.inprogressstring)\r\n  if (quest.comp >= quest.compmax) {\r\n    questcost (quest)\r\n    quest.qstep = quest.qstepmax\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"You have \"+ quest.comp + \"/\" + quest.compmax + quest.compstring + \"<br>\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (quest.unlocked = true) {\r\n  msg (quest.unlockedstring)\r\n  quest.qstep = quest.qstep + 1\r\n  quest.started = true\r\n}\r\nelse if (quest.pending = true) {\r\n  msg (quest.pendingstring)\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (quest.initalstring)\r\n}\r\ncheckprogress (quest)\r\n```\r\nThe \"reward\" and \"questcost\" functions just check which is being named then gives a reward or takes an item based on the quest they receive. \r\nEach of the booleans have a changescript which updates the Quest Book list. They all look similar to this.\r\n**Boolean changescript** meetbubbles is the name of the questobject(Yes I know Meat Bubbles and meetbubbles are spelled differently)\r\n```\r\nif (meetbubbles.pending = true) {\r\n  list add (pending.list, \"Meat Bubbles\")\r\n  meetbubbles.pendingstring = \"Meow,<br>Hello Human.<br>You need to level up to help me.<br>\"\r\n}\r\nelse if (meetbubbles.pending = false) {\r\n  list remove (pending.list, \"Meat Bubbles\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe system works and makes for easy quest creation. Often though it doesn't  have great flow, and can be hard to tell what to do next. I'm planning on adding a short description of what you need to do next in the Quest Book list as opposed to just a name, but I know it needs more help than that. \r\n\r\nI'm mainly wondering if I should just scratch this method(probably my fifth attempt on a quest function) or if I'm on the right track.",
