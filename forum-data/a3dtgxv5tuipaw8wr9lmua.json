      "EditableText": "Hi,\r\nI tried to use the locked feature, using the italian traslation. The default message  should be _\"è chius\" + object'suffix_.\r\n\r\n\"E' chius\" means \"is closed\", but without last letter (so it becames: \"is close\"), because in italian this last letter is the suffix of the name (it change depending on type: female, male, inanimate)\r\n\r\nI found code in \"italiano.aslx\":\r\n ``` <dynamictemplate name=\"LockedObject\">WriteVerb(object, \"essere\") + \" chius\" + GetSuffix (object) + \" a chiave.\"</dynamictemplate>```\r\n\r\nSo, if I lock a door (in italian door is \"porta\", feminine: suffix is \"a\"), I expect \"E' chiusa\". \r\nInstead, it writes just \"E' chius\", without any suffix.\r\n\r\nI can't figure out how resolve this.\r\nThank you",
