You can modify that to reflect your Danish changes (or just copy the file over and rename it).\n\nYou can test the game directly in the folder by running the &quot;my game.exe&quot; (named the same as your game).\n\nOnce you've got that working, you'll need to recreate the package. To do this, double-click the &quot;setup.iss&quot; file. This will launch InnoSetup. Click the Build menu, then Compile. This will recreate the setup exe in the Output folder.\n\n(If you update your game file, you don't need to go through all this again. Instead, you can use Quest Compiler to create a new CAS file, copy that to the Package folder, then run InnoSetup to recreate the setup EXE.)",
