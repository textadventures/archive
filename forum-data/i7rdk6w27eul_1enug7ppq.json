How I've been doing this is putting all the possible entrances, items, or NPCs in their appropriate rooms, making it so the player can't see or interact with them without them being mentioned by the game, then have a bunch of [random:] things containing the entrances/items/NPCs, thus making a \"randomly generated map\". Has anyone else been trying to make rogue-like text adventures? Care to share any tips?",

      "EditableText": "There are a lot of pseudo-roguelike-like workarounds you can use when you encounter engine limitations. Instead of randomly generated maps, you could use multiple pre-generated static maps and randomized nodes so the same map would feel different in other playthroughs. Send the player to dungeon 1, 2, or 3. So the first level of the dungeon could have 3 different possible maps that a player may be sent to. So, it would be extra work, of course. \r\n\r\nYou could spawn the player at different starting points in each dungeon. You could have nodes throughout the dungeon, that are randomly generated when the player enters the room. You could have a universal node that randomly selects from a set of enemies, treasure, or other things. You could have specific mob, treasure, and thing nodes, too. \r\n\r\nYou can definitely do a lot with random number generation. I'm currently working on a game in Quest that uses multiple, random descriptions. Some are for game color and humor, and others are to make playthroughs more unique, like those nodes I talked about.\r\n\r\nThat said, Inform 7 might be better for what you want to do. In fact, a fairly notable IF roguelike was made with it. Check out the game and then maybe check out Inform.\r\n\r\nhttps://kerkerkruip.org/about/\r\n\r\nWhatever you use, you really want to focus on getting the framework and core mechanics in place. It sounds like that's what you're working on.",
