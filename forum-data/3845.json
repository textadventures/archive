I can do it with gifs, but would prefer to be able to just flash an image when needed.\n\nSecond, I want to add a simple combat system. Basically just the player having a weapon handy and people that attack them when they go into certain rooms. No frills, just an automatic back and forth till one is dead. The player generally speaking, the fights are to add tension and paranoia, it's not a fighting game. If possible have it output a message based on what weapon was used to kill the attacker with. IE, if they have a knife it gives them a message about cutting the attacker to ribbons.\n\nThird, a timer that activates whenever they are in the hallways, so room specific. Or possibly just a timer that starts when they are in any location for too long and gives them a short time to move on before... well  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /><!-- s:shock: --> .

I decided to skip actual combat and just have that stuff happen as narrative events that can be triggered.\n\nI could still use some help on setting up a countdown timer that resets when they change rooms. And with making a picture flash on the screen for about 1 second. I looked through the docs, but didn't find anything that seemed to cover what I need.\n\nAll I really need is a script/command to remove a, or all, picture(s). Then I just have to set it up to show the pic when they first trigger the event, then run a timer to clear it after a second or so. So they trigger the event, pic pops onto the screen, then clears. Add a nice noise and it's a classic BOO! moment.\n\nThe timer I am not determined to use, if that would be difficult to set up, I just like the idea of forcing the player to keep moving around instead of being able to sit and twiddle their thumbs while they decide what to do next. A timer with a random countdown value between 1 and 5 minutes that starts when they enter a room and they die if it runs out, but they can't see it, so they would never know just how long they had before &quot;it&quot; found them. That would be fun.\n\nAlso, what are your thoughts on puzzle complexity. Right now I am going with the simple &quot;find the keys to escape&quot; puzzle type, with roughly 12 steps to win the game. Which will require hunting through an asylum with over 150 rooms (I already have the building set up), some of which will be instant game overs if they enter, and others will contain narrative fights with surviving lunatics that can also kill the player if they run into too many.\n\nBeing that it's my first game, should I stick with what I'm doing and focus on making the place as scary and intense as possible, or do you think I should also try to work in a more advanced puzzle or two? \nI plain to get this done in time for Halloween and do a cross promotion campaign with it, including three different versions of the game. I can offer links to your own games/sites from the page I put this game up on to anyone willing to help me out with some more elaborate puzzle ideas/code.\nI'm especially keen on the notion of a puzzle they have to work out in real time if I can also get the countdown timer incorporated.\n\nAny thoughts are welcome.",

      "EditableText": "Well, the game actually starts off with a six step puzzle just to get out of the first room. With ways to mess up and be unable to get out.\n\nAfter that what I have so far is a basic hunt down the keys or other items needed to get outside, without getting killed. I will probably include rooms that are traps and will require puzzles of varying difficulties to escape in the more difficult versions. My plan at the moment is to get the basic game done, then create the other two versions by moving things around and adding more layers. \n\nI think my fear is that if I try to get too cute, or get too sadistic, I will make a game that could be great for horror gamers, but ends up being more or a rage quit game. My sense is that horror game lovers like being freaked out, disturbed, disgusted and even frustrated. My concern is with how far to go. Particularly with the frustration. \n\nI could make it so they can't go more than a few rooms without having to figure out a way to get doors open, the question is... should I?\n\nAs it is the basic version of the game will have that first room puzzle, plus 12 or so additional steps they have to do to get out. Which will require carefully searching through over 150 rooms. What difficulty level would you consider that? It really comes down to the process of elimination in the end once you're out of the first room. Since it's a horror game, is that enough puzzle difficulty? IE, keep the puzzles simple and just work on trying to scare the crap out of people? Or is it too simple? I aim to make the player paranoid to open doors, which is precisely what they have to do to find what they need and win the game. Is that enough, or should I try to work in more complicated puzzles as well?\n\nThere is also the issue of making sure it fits and makes sense. I have always hated games that stick weird, complicated puzzles in stupid places. IE, the Fatal Frame series that uses odd seals and things on doors... in houses with thin Japanese walls (paper windows) that you could kick your way through without much trouble, tiny Japanese ladies as the PCs or not. Or the classic wooden doors that are somehow the nemesis of anyone carrying around big, sharp metal weapons... which are often magic.

In horror it is to be scared. Being able to escape a cell in maximum security without needing to think about it a bit is neither realistic or scary. Good horror relies heavily on things making sense and being realistic, until they aren't. A lot of the scenes in Poltergeist rely on the realistic mundanity of the activities taking place, getting a late night snack, cleaning up after breakfast, settling down to sleep, etc... to give the horrific paranormal events context and meaning. The chairs stacking themselves at the beginning is scary (or at least startling) because chairs don't do that sort of thing on their own.\n\nConsidering that Sing Sing can hold around 1700 prisoners I would have to say that my little 132 cell asylum is a mini. I went with something realistic, but manageable. For both myself and players.\n\nAs for the way I am pacing the game, players are meant to feel overwhelmed yet claustrophobic. It is a big place, but they are trapped in it. Trapped inside with the criminally insane and something supernatural. And the only way to get out is to go searching through this place for the various objects that will allow you to escape alive.\n\nIf you work to make a horror game worrying too much about players quitting then you don't understand horror as a genre. It is meant to be difficult and scary. Horror players want to be spanked, the harder the better. Sure, some will quit, but if you succeed in dragging players down into your world... Frustrate them, make them feel helpless and out of their depth. Scare them, terrify them. Make them sweat just opening a door... you will be a legend. Of course some balance is required to keep them from giving up, but there in lay the fun, seeing what you can get away with.\n\nConsider the popularity of the indie game Slender. A game with almost no story or content, and the same basic gameplay repeated several times. And yet it is very popular because as simple as it is, when played the right way it succeeds in freaking people out.\n\nFrom my point of view I'm not making a text adventure, I'm using a text adventure program to make a horror game. I don't know how to use Flash or similar, but I can type, create sounds, music, and images, which is all I really need for this program. Text based game play is just the container, the content is still based around trying to make you fall out of your chair and/or leave the room because you can't take any more. I will try to mess with your head. I will try to present things to you that you don't want to read, see or hear. I will be using sound, pictures, and everything else I can to try and make you stop playing, not because the game is hard, but because you want to actually sleep again some day. Making a horror game that a lot of people stop playing because it's just too scary is not failure, it is success. I will try to put things in your head that will not leave you alone. That will give you nightmares. \nIf I can make you crawl through the game at a snails pace because you are doing everything you can to stay safe, the game works and is at the least making you paranoid. If I can make you spend 10 minutes debating on whether or not you really need to unlock that door and go in that room, I have done my job and made a horror game. If I can make you stop playing and go turn on all the lights I have done my job very well and actually scared you. If I can actually make you lose sleep, then I have reached the goal of every person who works in the horror genre, I got in your head.",
