      "EditableText": "Right now, the only way to edit an aslx file is by using the windows version of Quest. That's fine for everyone that uses Windows, but not great if you want to use any other operating system. While the devs have stated the possibility of a OS X/Linux version of Quest in the future, the browser version is already cross-platform by nature. This would also allow people to edit a file in different computers, Windows or not, without having to download the file every time. \r\n\r\nThis topic has come up in the past and one of the biggest concerns people have raised is that there are features in the Windows editor that aren't available in the online editor. I doubt that would break games imported into the online editor, they just couldn't be edited through that platform. Even if importing to the online editor would break the game, I don't think it would be hard to only import the parts compatible with the online editor. They use the same base engine and the same version of Quest, so only minor changes would have to be made.\r\n\r\nIf the devs see this, please implement a way to upload .aslx files to the online editor. It would be a huge quality of life improvement for anyone who has a saved aslx file that they want to use to make a game. Thank you.",

This isn't about me wanting to make Quest games on a Mac, its about the devs not making this god-forsaken engine compatible with itself. _itself._ The online editor is extremely convenient and cross-platform and all that I need is just a full code view in the browser editor. That would let me ctrl+c ctrl+v the source code into the editor and done. For how much potential it has, the browser editor seems horribly neglected. As I said before, it cannot be that hard to make a feature that loads a file type that the editor already uses. Quest 6 is still in development and probably will be for a while, so why not get a head start on cross-compatibility? This just seems like a feature so basic it could be used to unclog drains.\r\n\r\nSorry if I come across as rude, I just have high quantities of salt in my veins that this isn't a thing.",
