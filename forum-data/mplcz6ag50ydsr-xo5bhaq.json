Remember making the room dark by selecting it dark in the Object settings, and create the lamp object, giving it settings to be useble, may be turned on and creates light.  Having a lamp illuminating a dark room is a kind of basic and almost automated feature in Quest. Take a look at Quest domumentation. Other recurring game resources are documented there too.",
