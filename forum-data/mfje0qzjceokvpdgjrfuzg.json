If anyone wants to test out the game while it is in its early stages and provide feedback or give new ideas that would be much appreciated. I am already working with a person who is voice acting one of the 2 characters but am also looking for someone who can take the time to voice act or read out some lines. Anyone interested either leave comment on the game or send me an email at alektowr@gmail.com",
