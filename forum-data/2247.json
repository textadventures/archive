'Cause I don't really wanna spoil it (anyway the game is short enough), let's just say there are 2 objects.\nThere's object A and object B.\nI want that object B to [b:1l85xjk6]not[/b:1l85xjk6] be seen. I only want it to be revealed after the player interacts with object A. Also, the two objects are in different rooms. Plus, after using an object C on it, the object B should reveal a secret exit. The object A is NOT a container, so that's what makes it a bit difficult for me.\nAlso, object C must be firstly a hidden object. The object D that reveals it is not a container either. Is it the same thing as the one above, without the secret exit?\nI really forgot how to do it, so please help me by telling me exactly what to do?  <!-- s:cry: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Crying or Very sad\" /><!-- s:cry: --> \n\nThanks!",
