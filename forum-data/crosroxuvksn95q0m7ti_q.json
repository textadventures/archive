Some is pixel art, some is derived from 3D objects that I created, and others are backgrounds that might be useful in visual novels and interactive fiction. You’ll find them on my new “ART” pages on my website:  \r\n\r\nhttp://soundimage.org/\r\n\r\nThe art pages are located at the bottom of the menu list on the right side of the screen.\r\n\r\nAt this point I’m experimenting with different styles and methods so hopefully I will be able to offer a good variety of things. Please feel free to modify / edit as needed. If you happen to find any of these images helpful and decide to use them, please attribute me in the “game art” section of your credits area. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
