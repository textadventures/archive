Is there anyway to do this without having to force the player to type the look command?  I'd like to do it without any turns passing.\n\nThe main reason I want this is becasue I want the screen to clear every time a room description is shown, and I figured the best way to do that is by creating my own override look command.  I don't want the screen to clear every turn however, like if the player picks something up.  Actually, it would be even better if there were a way to run scripts whenever a room's description is displayed, or if there was a way to edit the game-inherent commands like the look and movement commands.  This way I could also have the screen clear when a player enters a new room.",
