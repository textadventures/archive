I'm trying to create a starship mechanic where you select your destination from a menu and you fly there, with the hatch on the ship serving as your entrance and exit.\n\nIn order to do this, I tried to code it where selecting an option deletes the current exit and creates a brand new one with the same name (since as far as I can tell altering an exit's out point is impossible in script. I tried to do it by changing a variable in the exit itself but it kept giving me a error.)  I've used a menu system earlier in the game for character creation with great success, but this part keeps kicking back the same  &quot;Unknown object or variable&quot; error every time I try to specify the direction of the script-created exit. It asks for the type of exit but no matter how I express it it still gives me the same problem.\n\n          if (not GetBoolean(player, &quot;firstjourney&quot;)) {\n            msg (&quot; Intro message&quot;)\n            SSspacewindow.local = &quot;Starport&quot;\n            destroy (&quot;hatch&quot;)\n            create exit (&quot;hatch&quot;, Helm, Starport, South)\n          }\n          else {\n            msg (&quot;Your ship rumbles as it takes off to the spaceport in a flash.
