      "EditableText": "Well it's not really a custom build - a custom build is an EXE file which is tailored to you. What you're describing is putting the normal Quest EXE and an ASL file in your own setup. This is really not something I recommend - you will very likely omit some files that Quest needs. If you want to redistribute Quest, you can only do so using the original Quest download file, e.g. quest312.exe from <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.axeuk.com/quest/download.htm\">http://www.axeuk.com/quest/download.htm</a><!-- m --> . If you want to do that, that's fine, though if you're just distributing via a website it's easier all round if you just include a link to that page, and then all you need to do is give a link to your ASL or CAS file.",
