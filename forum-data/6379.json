Of course I will be using Phonegap to turn my Javascript file into an Android file.\n\nMy question is: does all &quot;custom&quot; code have to be Javascript? What if I have a section of code that is &lt;i&gt;italicized&lt;/i&gt; using HTML? Or **Markdown**? Is Phonegap only compatible with Jscript? Sorry for my naivete.\n\n--\n\nI managed to change the color of hyperlinks in my game, but there is blue underline under the links no matter what I do. Here's a screenshot:\n\n[img:2giy2bo0]http&#58;//i&#46;imgur&#46;com/Ix8sacB&#46;png[/img:2giy2bo0]\n\nAny tips?",
