I've figured out that I need to make the \"door\" a \"room\" of its own, so in other words, make three rooms: Room 1, the Door, then Room 2. Right? Then put a \"Knob\" on the door as an Object, and give it a verb, \"Turn.\" And then give the door a verb called \"Open.\" But that's all I've figured out. Please help! What do I do next? Please be aware that I am a complete n00b. I know my way around program code -- I've written code in Java, JavaScript, and AppleScript, so I'm no stranger to that realm, if I need to go there. However I am TOTALLY and completely NEW to the realm of Quest and Text Adventure creation! Any help is greatly appreciated!\r\n",

The player doesn’t see the two object doors as two doors.  Just the one.  Make sure the alias for each is the same.  If you’re REALLY nit picky, you’d also have to have a proper look at description for the door from each side and assume the door only swings one way (unlike KV - haha).\r\n\r\nI’ve also really gotten lazy on occasion and used things like siding doors or doors that simply disappear when unlocked.  Just depends what you want to do.\r\n\r\nNot sure I helped or muddied the water more.  It’s what I do!\r\n\r\nAnd I typed this on my phone in between one of about 100 grad parties I had to go to so forgive the muck of it all.  :)",
