I've had a bit of a search around and couldn't find anything so I thought I would post a question.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm trying to add a time system into the game book which increases the time every time the reader/player goes to a new page. On the first page, I set variables in the code view as such:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntime = 1030\r\nrTime = time%60\r\nmsg (\"The current time is:  \"+(time/60)+\":\"+rTime)\r\n```\r\nThis works fine, and prints the value of **17:10** when in game.\r\n\r\nNow, when I go to the next page,  and ask it to print the value of _time_, it instead prints the following error message:\r\n```\r\nError running script: Error compiling expression 'time': Unknown object or variable 'time'\r\n```\r\nHere is a link to the picture of the code in case that helps: http://i.imgur.com/SrRbAJB.png\r\nA picture of page one in game: http://i.imgur.com/DpkR62O.png\r\nA picture of page two in game: http://i.imgur.com/VootaoA.png\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this! :)",
