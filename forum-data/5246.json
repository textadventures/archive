It is very early on so there arent many details that i can share yet as things are likely to change in development. My basic idea is to have the player be a knight who has to save his town and possible his love interest from an evil wizard.  i know that is very typical of fantasy stories but i intend to liven things up through satire of the fantasy ganre as a whole as well as adding in interesting side characters to meet through out your journey and even taking suggestions from people here on the forum.... lets face it i need all the help i can get.",

The story itself will be in a traditional fantasy setting.... you know swords and sorcery with dragons and trolls and what not, but I would like to add in some satirical comedy... one of my more ambitious goals is to make a branching story in which depending on the choices you make the main character develops differently ranging from a persona style silent protagonist with no real dialog to a wise cracking knight with a huge ego...  so I would need a vague title but yet something that can still catch peoples attention.   Oh and if I decide to add your suggestions to the game you will get your screen name (or whatever you wish to by identified as) in the credits....",
