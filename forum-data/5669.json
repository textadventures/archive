      "EditableText": "Hello, all. Not sure how many of the regulars I became familiar with are still here - shout up if you are!\n\nAnyway, been messing around with Twine - another CYOA creator. It's very good, but is designed specifically for the 'multiple choice' style gameplay, rather that the traditional input style that I grew up on.\n\nOne thing is does have over Quest, I feel, is that the games are made entirely of html, so can be published virtually anywhere. All in all, Twine is far more user-friendly, especially for noobs like me.\n\nHowever, it's nowhere near as deep as Quest and I'm missing the ability to create input style games. I'm back as I have an idea for a game based on the PC MMO game, DayZ.\n\nI say 'maybe' back, because it's been so long that I've pretty much forgotten everything I learned while I was here last. If I can simply dive straight in using one of the templates from my old games, that would be okay, but I really don't relish having to do all the setting up, such as adding all the CSS, javascript and other codes to get to the state my other games are in.\n\nAny advice?",
