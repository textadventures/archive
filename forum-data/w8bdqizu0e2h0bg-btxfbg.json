The problem is, I can't seem to find any link that shows me a step-by-step tutorial for gamebook beginners. There is indeed a step-by-step tutorial for text adventure. Is there really no link for it? Or am I just too silly to find it?",

You can do scripting via choosing for the 'page type' for your Page Objects, as: [SCRIPT] or [SCRIPT + TEXT], which then allows you to do scripting, which is mostly the same as it is in/for Text Adventures (which there's plenty of help for using Attributes and the 'if' Script, aka scripting stuff).",
