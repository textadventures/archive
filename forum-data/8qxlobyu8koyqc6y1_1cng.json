      "EditableText": "I am stuck on the Quest tutorial on the \"More things to do with objects\" section. Specifically the \"Using the defibrillator\" subsection where you have to use the defibrillator to revive Bob and bring him back to life. When bringing him back to life you put in this message here.\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/Use3.png\r\n\r\nThen when verifying it, when you revive Bob when he is alive, it comes up with the same text as I posted above. The tutorial expects me to know what to do so it says something else when I try to revive him when he is alive. However...I don't know what to do. I managed to get through the tutorial this far without getting stuck, but now I have hit a brick wall.\r\n\r\nCome someone please help me? How do I make the text output say something along the lines of \"Bob is alive so you don't need to use the defibrillator now\" when I use it on Bob when he is alive?\r\n\r\nHere is the tutorial to get a better understanding of what I'm talking about: http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/more_things_to_do_with_objects.html",
