If I open up an asl file, (as in the game I'm currently making) by right clicking on it, and click &quot;open with....QDK&quot;, then it opens with QDK. Now, let's say I have Room1, and going west leads to Room2. If I click on Room1 properties and look at the compass, It doesn't say that west leads to Room2. However, when I play it, It does lead to Room2. Now, if I open up QDK, then click open file, and open it up, it [b:1c43vile]does[/b:1c43vile] show the compass directions. Any clue what that might be?",
