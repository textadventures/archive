So, the question is: Is there any chance of seeing squiffy integrated with unity like these other two ? Making a light squiffy android app is easy with phonegap, but for desktop... you need to go full nwjs, meaning a non less than 160 mb for a text game. That´s ridiculously huge. Unity can achieve text executable around 20 mb, but not over pure js.\r\n\r\nAnd a technical question. Can you access localstorage js function from squiffy? When I try to access it to save one custom variable, both the editor version and the build one just stops in that line.\r\nOr, is there any way to access squiffy´s use of the localstorage capabilities to make persistent sessions?\r\n\r\nVery excited to have found squiffy and eager to get this littel issued around.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBelén M.",
