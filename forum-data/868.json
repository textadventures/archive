You can do them as variables, or as properties on the objects/characters themselves. Each way has pros and cons.\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to do it is as properties on the objects, because if you use variables, you'll likely have to have quite a bit of them depending on how many stats you have, and how many objects are going to use them. I used to do stats in variables only, and it got tiring real quick. Or you can even do a little of both worlds.",

That is the monsters (depending on their level) give you a certain amount of exp. as your exp increases so do your levels. The higher level you are the harder creatures you fight and the more exp you gain. same with gp. as your level increases so does the amount of max mp your character has. mp decreases with spell usage, and increases from a healer shop or from various potions you can buy.  just curious as to what everyone else thinks about this approach",
