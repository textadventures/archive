It's been a dream of mine to design a game for a long time, and I'm finally getting to do it. My main inspiration was Corruption of Champions for it's style - not a huge fan of the sexual themes present in it though. It was just surprising to me that text based games in this day and age are still fun.\nI'm probably going to scrap this version of the project and start over. The amount I've learned in just two days has revealed errors that I need to go over and fix (Such as trying to do the combat tutorial all in the GUI instead of a library.)",
