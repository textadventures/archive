      "EditableText": "I suspect the easiest way would be to have a separate attribute for each pronoun. For example, if you have a page where the player chooses, the male option would lead to a page with the script:\r\n```\r\nplayer.heshe = \"he\"\r\nplayer.himher = \"him\"\r\nplayer.hisher = \"his\"\r\nplayer.hishers = \"his\"\r\n```\r\nand so on. Then you can just include `{player.heshe}` in the text later in the game, and it will be replaced as appropriate.\r\n\r\nI believe the text adventure mode does this with attributes named `gender`, `article`, and `possessive`; but I think names like heshe make it easier to remember which one you want in a given situation.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be setting one attribute for 'gender', but add a couple of functions to the text processor in the start script. The scriptdictionary `game.textprocessorcommands` contains a bunch of different functions; you could add your own code there to generate different text based on the player's gender. But I suspect this would be overkill in a game where you're only using it for one character,",
