You don't have to make any Attribute. It turns out, there are already these attributes preprogrammed with Quest! For example, 'Can I drop this?' relates to the attribute WhateverObject.drop being True or False. So you can just:\r\n```\r\nset WhateverObject.drop=False\r\n```\r\nThere's a bunch of different attributes for these things. Open/Closeable, as far as I can tell, is linked to WhateverObject.open and WhateverObject.close respectively.",
