No matter what I put in the player description box, typing 'look at me', only results in 'Looking great', or something like that. \n\nSecondly, I'm having trouble getting the syntax for returning attribute values right. I mean making the game print the message &quot;You have (player.gold) gold.&quot;  I prefer to use the QUI whenver I can. I know in the tutorial it says it should be like &quot;You have&quot; +player.gold+ &quot;gold.&quot; but I can't seem to get that to work.",

I don't know why the player isn't set up properly out of the box.\n\nClick on the player object, and go to the Features tab. At the bottom, check &quot;Player: player can become this object&quot;. Then a new Player tab will appear, and you can go set the player description there. (You'll see it default to Looking Good.)\n\nFor the second, you can use a text processor command. Be sure you define the attribute on the player ahead of time on the attributes tab (else it will give an error). Be sure it's a proper Attribute, in the list at the *bottom* of the Attributes tab, not a Status Attribute. Then you can simply output something like:\n\nThe player has {player.gold} gold.\n\nNote that those are curly braces, not parentheses.",

Instead, there's another place for your description for your controlled Player Object, which Jay has already given to you. It took me awhile to realize this exact same problem myself, you're not the first to be confused by this issue with descriptions for the Player Objects.",
