Now that I've started editing again after a hiatus, however, I'm finding that this doesn't work. It seems tedious to have to list multiple verbs for the same effect. Is this a bug?",

      "EditableText": "If you have the same verb on multiple lists I believe it can cause a conflict.\n\ne.g. you have two verb sets like\n1 - knock; jostle; knock over; push\n2 - press; push\n\nLet's say there's a button you want to press. Typing &quot;press button&quot; is fine because press is only there once, but try using &quot;push button&quot; and Quest cannot tell which &quot;push&quot; the player means. It will find the first one it comes to (knock etc.) then stop looking, even though the button is not able to be &quot;knocked.&quot; Therefore your script for &quot;press&quot; won't run.\n\nIf you have a word that can have more than one meaning, it is best to apply it by itself as separate verb. I find it is easier (in most but not all cases) to create a function, and have all verbs added separately but running that one function. This is because you never know what verbs you might want to use in a different sense for future objects, and makes adding synonymous verbs to the object if you think of some later on a lot simpler. It might be a little more tedious at first, but it makes editing and revising things down the line much easier. (Make sure you're using functions rather than trying to copy and paste the whole script each time, because that would be tedious.)",
