I am struggling to set a custom exit alias, it says in the basic help page it is possible but I seem unable to do so without the alias I type in the box reverting to being blank the moment I leave the exit tab. Pressing enter when you type it or not pressing enter doesn't seem to have an effect. I see no option to add in custom alias's so I am stumped.\r\n\r\nI need an alias where players type begin to enter a game room from the intro page I have them starting on. Something really simple if possible.\r\n\r\n2) How do I add a basic category to contain things neat and tidy?\r\n\r\nWhen I try to setup an object as a category, say 'house category' and another category for example 'factory category', to contain all the rooms for those areas neat and tidy, if the player starts in for example living room, inside the house object, when I run the game they start inside the house category object instead. For some reason they start inside the wrapper or folder object i've setup to contain all the rooms, not the sub room inside of it. I don't want people seeing the house object, I just want that as a category to keep all the rooms tidy in the editor. I've read a couple of threads on this but I am not sure they directly relate, turning it invisible etc doesn't seem to help.",
