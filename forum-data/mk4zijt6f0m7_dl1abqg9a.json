If I know the name of the specific parent object which the command will ALWAYS refer to, I simply enter the parent object's name in the Scope field.\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere's what I'd very much like to figure out:\r\n1. How do I make a command that will work for each and every object in the game without knowing the specifics up front?\r\n     - I've tried setting up an attribute that equaled ```AllObjects()```. I tried it as a script, a string, a list, a dictionary... I couldn't figure it out.\r\n2. It says I can use an attribute in the Scope field. How does that work? I can't get anything out of it...\r\n\r\n---\r\nMy wish is to interact with any given NPC in any given room via two-way radio.\r\n\r\nNPC, COME IN\r\n\r\nThat's the command I'm after. I'm trying not to clone or move anything around and only work with the ask attribute on each NPC.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVER AND OUT would 'disconnect', placing the NPC back out of scope.\r\n\r\nIs this possible?",
