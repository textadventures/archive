But can you describe the problems you're having with updating?\n\nOne thing I've done in the past is to change the ID that's in the game. I've done that when I've uploaded changes and they don't take effect. Changing the ID seems to make the website sit up and notice it's new. (I know, rub two stick, voodoo stuff with no scientific basis.) To do that, go to the Game object and click &quot;Generate&quot; next to the current game ID. Then save and publish your game again.\n\nIf you're actually having trouble uploading the file, then that's something else, and it would be good to know what you're seeing.\n\n(Sorry for the delay answering this)",
