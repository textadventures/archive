But one of the secondary sidequests eludes me. Namely, Betty Brant and J.J.J.\nI've tried every power in the game on both JJJ and even Betty (manually), taked to both, and used the only useable item on them (I made a checklist and followed it just because). Nothing. \nI'd guess it would be related to the otherwise-unused power ([size=40:2jabjbr6]telekinesis[/size:2jabjbr6]) but haven't managed to achieve it.\nIf the author is reading this: there's any way to do that? Or are them red herrings?",
