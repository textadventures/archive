And rather than only encoding certain characters, I just decided to encode them all. This is the resulting straightforward function:\n\n[code:3qaq9iam]  &lt;function name=&quot;GetLiteralString&quot; parameters=&quot;s&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;\n    outs = &quot;&quot;\n    for (i, 1, LengthOf(s)) {\n      outs = outs + &quot;&amp;#&quot; + Asc(Mid(s, i, 1)) + &quot;;&quot;\n    }\n    return (outs)\n    &#93;&#93;&gt;\n  &lt;/function&gt;[/code:3qaq9iam]\n\nIf you print out the result with msg, you'll see the same as what was input, but none of the special characters will kick in, since they're all encoded. It does mean that if you look at itin the debugger, you'll just see a bunch of encoded characters. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
