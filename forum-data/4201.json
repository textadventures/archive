I'm pretty knowledgeable in HTML and CSS and could easily change it to what I want, I'm just not sure how to get to where those are set.  I'm trying to redesign it so that it fits based on percentages (for a reactive site) rather than on set pixels.  I've already tried it through the HTML tools and got it to do exactly what I wanted, but again, not sure how to actually make this a permanent change.  If anyone could point me in the right direction that'd be great.",

However, you are correct that it does reset to the standard layout after it gets loaded from a save (predictably because the start up script doesn't run).  I'll look into this.\n\n[b:14n86o30]Edit:[/b:14n86o30]  Nailed it!  I knew that some function had to initiate before the game could load, whether it was from the start script or from somewhere else.  Turns out I was right.  The function &quot;InitInterface&quot; (presumably short for &quot;Initiate Interface&quot;) is the code which runs the setup for the whole interface section (don't you love the obvious!)  I have this code set up as a .js file:\n\n[code:14n86o30]function setUI() {\n\telm1 = document&#46;getElementById(&quot;gameBorder&quot;);\n\telm1&#46;style&#46;width = &quot;100%&quot;;\n\telm1&#46;style&#46;border = &quot;none&quot;;\n\telm2 = document&#46;getElementById(&quot;gameContent&quot;);\n\telm2&#46;style&#46;width = &quot;96%&quot;;\n\telm2&#46;style&#46;padding = &quot;20px 2% 0px 2%&quot;;\n\telm3 = document&#46;getElementById(&quot;status&quot;);\n\telm3&#46;style&#46;width = &quot;100%&quot;;\n\telm3&#46;style&#46;position = &quot;relative&quot;;\n\telm3&#46;style&#46;border = &quot;none&quot;;\n}[/code:14n86o30]\n\nEssentially this just changes various attributes of the html and css to make the page percentage based.  Useful if you're implementing this into a website, as I am (woot &lt;object&gt; tag).  Then I just went into the InitInterface function, went all the way to the bottom after it's done setting everything up and added this:\n\n[b:14n86o30]NOTE:[/b:14n86o30] If you use this .js code, it's intended for a total fill, 100% of whatever tag/window it is in and it also assumes there are no side panels.  If you are using side panels or want different percentage fill you'll need to set up the percentages differently.\n\n[code:14n86o30]request (RunScript, &quot;setUI&quot;)[/code:14n86o30]\n\nIt works like a charm no matter if it's loaded fresh or from a save.  Thanks again for pointing that out Liam!",
