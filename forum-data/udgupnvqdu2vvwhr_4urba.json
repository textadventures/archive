      "EditableText": "Hi! I was wondering how I can make a music file play continuously across rooms in the gamebook version of Quest?\r\n\r\nThere's an action tab in each room that allows me to select a music file and check a box that says \"continue to play sound after player moves to another page\". This makes it so the track plays on in the background as the player moves between pages, but the track does *not* loop and there is no option to make it loop.\r\n\r\nConversely, if I play a track using the script + text utility, it lets me pass an argument to loop the track, but it immediately stops playing in the next room. The only \"workaround\" is setting up the script in said other room, but that makes it so it resets and it sounds very clunky and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nI want a track that loops to be played throughout some pages without interruption. Is that possible?\r\n\r\n",
