      "EditableText": ">Seems like there would always be 2 Supermans once Main Superman arrived in his past in this scenario . . .\r\n\r\nThere’s the fallacy in time travel scenarios.  As far as we know, time travel is NOT possible, barring a hypothetical (and highly doubted) Einstein-Rosen bridge.  Superman could be a 4th dimension being, not seeing time as a sequence of ‘nows’ but instead seeing and interacting with the beginning and end of a “time-thread” at once or all at once.  Superman gave no indication he could do that, nor would we fans want him to.  As I believe, this would eliminate “free will” and there would be no point in Superman going out of his way to do heroic feats.  It’s already been done.  Then, of course, maybe that Lois and world-saving scenario already did happen and he had to go through that situation because he was destined to.  It would have happened regardless.  But, we 3rd dimension beings had to see the movie to appreciate it so they had to show it on the big screen.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, if time travel did exist as portrayed in the movie, he should not have flown around the earth in circles.  He should have flown much faster than light speed to some ‘once-now fragment’ out in space where light left 6 minutes and 44 seconds ago.  Now the question, to me, is... once he met (caught up with) that light, could he have interacted with it anyway?\r\n\r\nPS - I may not be making sense.  Who’d a thunk it?",

There’s no reason why he couldn’t do both in the original timeline.  How would Superman run out of time??  It just doesn’t make sense.  Unless... he can’t really travel that fast.  I dunno.",

More earth time would have passed than ‘your’ time.  You’re gone 5 minutes whereas 1 hour (or ten, or 50, or 1000 would have passed on earth).  You’ve essentially gone into earth’s future.\r\n2.  Hang out near the edge of a black hole or some other REALLY massive object, like in interstellar.  Example:  satellite clocks tick faster than those here on earth because there is less gravitational distortion of space-time.\r\n\r\nSo... what about traveling backward into the past?  The only way I can see how it’s possible is to reverse the scenarios above:\r\nA.  To slow down your space-time relative to earth space-time.  This would be impossible in standard travel.  We would have to exit the galaxy, find some distance nook in the universe that has minimal expansion, and the return to earth in order to be on earth AND in the earths past.  You can see the impossibilities here I think.  BUT... and this is purely theoretical...you can create a wormhole, the “center” of which is essentially motionless.  Hang out there, then get spit out of it.  Voila!  You’ve succeeded in entering the past.  But, current physics doesn’t believe this really to be feasible.  But... if you’re millions of years more advanced than a human (like Superman possibly could be) he probably chose this route and they just showed us him doing his weird (and scientifically asinine) fast-travel-spin-the-earth-backward thing.\r\nB.  Find some place in space where there is zero to minimal gravity and hang out there for a while as still as possible.  Again, not reasonable because the earth really ain’t big enough to create a gravitational well/space-time distortion that significantly would alter time as we perceive it.",

      "EditableText": "Back to the Future:\r\n\r\nThere's a model that does work.\r\nWhen you change the past, it creates two timelines, branching at that point.

The universe attempts to merge the two realities, mixing and matching bits from either of them to create the most stable timeline. It doesn't have to be consistent, and you can have a paradox because a traveller arrived from a future that no longer exists. The universe heals in a way that minimises total frag entropy; so it's not necessary for every character's timeline to make sense.\r\n\r\nA guy can arrive from the future, change things, and then vanish because he doesn't \"fit\" into the new universe, while leaving behind all the changes that he made. To the people he met directly, it's like the Mandela effect turned up to 11.
