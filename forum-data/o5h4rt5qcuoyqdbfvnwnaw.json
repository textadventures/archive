I was to make an object in a room, that represents the door to another room so when you select it on the objects and places pane it has the verb enter, and that will move the player to the room the door leads to. But it won't let me use enter as a verb, and every synonym I could think of for it.\r\nI know this can be done some way because I know someone who has a game where you are in a hallway and there are objects for doors, with the option to open them which move you into that room, but I can't figure out how and I would ask them but I have bombarded them with enough questions already and I do need to locate some answers on my own right",
