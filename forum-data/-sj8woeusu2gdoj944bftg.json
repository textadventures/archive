      "EditableText": "I just had a thought of something that could make combat in a text-based game a little more interesting.\r\n\r\nRather than \"attack goblin\" or whatever, each turn you'd have a couple of options pop up. Not every option is available in every situation, it depends on you and the monster moving around the room. Sometimes you can give the goblin a huge roundhouse punch, sometimes the arrangement of the room prevents it. Sometimes you can duck inside his reach to stab him in the gut, sometimes you can't.\r\n\r\nSo there's a list of moderately descriptive attacks, like \"Duck under the {enemy.alias}'s {enemy.weapon} and knock him off-balance with a vicious sucker punch\". As your combat skill or attack power levels up, you get more options. Some options might do more damage than others, or might knock an enemy down, stun them, or blind them.\r\n\r\nThere's also some less successful options. \"Duck under the {enemy.alias}'s blade, but don't see his off-hand coming up to knock your teeth out with a vicious sucker punch\"\r\nThose two options share a few words, and look pretty similar.\r\n\r\nEach turn, the game would pop up 3-6 options chosen at random. So you don't always have exactly the same options to choose from in the flow of battle. If there's more than one enemy, the function that picks the options would favour ones targeting an enemy who's not already mentioned, but beyond that it's random. So in the brawl, you might not always have a clear shot at the enemy you want to hit. So you might get to choose between getting a fleshwound on the mage who's preparing to fireball you, or getting lucky and decapitating a minion right off.\r\n\r\nYou get 3-6 options in a menu to choose from. And you'd be using a modified ShowMenu with some added JS (assuming Quest is the engine) that automatically selects an option after 5-10 seconds. If the enemy is faster than you, you get less thinking time. I'm thinking that against an enemy that's supposed to be a medium challenge, you'd get just barely enough time to read all the options. Against tough enemies, you need to know the options well enough to distinguish between the good and bad ones in an instant, because you won't have the thinking time anymore.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Kind of inspired by Radical Dreamers; and by an acrobatic platform-jumping sequence for my easter egg game this year. But I think as a combat thing, it could be pretty interesting.",

      "EditableText": "After writing this, I just thought about the addition of magic to a system like this.\r\n\r\n**Magic Option 1**\r\nThe spells you can cast are limited my the colours of mana in the air around you, so they show up in the list of options just like physical attacks. You don't know when a specific spell will be available. But spellcasting takes time. It would show up in the menu as \"Spellcasting (target goblin): F-I-R-E-B-A-L-L\". But the letters of the spell appear one at a time, at a speed determined by the character's magic stat. So you might have to wait a second before clicking to make sure the spell name isn't misspelled (which would fail to cast). If there isn't enough time for all the letters to appear, you wouldn't be given that option because the spell is beyond you; but if you wait for the whole word it might be a pretty tight window.\r\n\r\nFor magic, it might actually be possible to click on the enemy name, so there'd be a list of targets to choose from. Or maybe magic hits multiple enemies. I do like the idea of spells giving you a choice of who to cast them at, to offset the risk of injury if you click on an enemy name before the spell has finished casting.\r\n\r\n**Magic Option 2**\r\nRemember your spells: To use magic, you actually have to type the name of the spell, rather than just clicking an option. Obviously this is a harder option, but the spells can do enough damage to be worth the effort in some circumstances.\r\n\r\nMaybe if you've started typing when the turn timer expires, it triggers a kind of 'cancel' event, so instead of picking one at random, the enemy gets a free hit on you. But this doesn't interrupt your typing, so you can carry on typing the same spell for next turn. This could be really useful if you're using high-level insta-kill magic like Yancy Urglefloggah's Cantrip of Expedient Exsanguination.",
