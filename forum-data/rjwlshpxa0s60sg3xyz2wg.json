Current members have to go to my profile to change avatar by uploading pictures, which is a great function, except that it seems to make my avatar size big sized and everytime I review someone's game, my large avatar is being displayed despite me reviewing in 1 sentence only.\r\n4. I tried to upload pictures by copying and save those small pixel avatars and also use tiny blank picture but both pictures are still being treated as if they are big sized.\r\n5. New member avatars are the best, they take 0 size, if I have the choice, I would like to have a new member avatar, completely empty when posting review, the facebook like blank picture in new feed is alright, since news feed changes frequently.",
