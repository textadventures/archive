However, i have a set of bones which should not be disturbed. I want the game print a massage like &quot;It is not wise disturbing the bones&quot; but i have no clue where placing it. Actually, the only thing i want player doing is &quot;Look at bones&quot;, and it is already set. I cannot use the verb tab, because take is a verb already in use by Quest core. So, how may i solve this specific case?",
