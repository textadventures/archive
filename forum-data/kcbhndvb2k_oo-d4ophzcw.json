      "EditableText": "In reviews of I.F. games, one often sees \"guess the verb\" mentioned as a weakness or fault of puzzle-oriented text adventures.  And it might very well be a major flaw in a game for which the author has not put in reasonable synonyms or alternate ways of solving a puzzle that would be intuitive.\r\n\r\nI recently read a critique of Larry Horsfield's game Return to Castle Coris (not a Quest game, but he makes rather good text adventures available on ADRIFT).  The reviewer complained that he could not attract the attention of an eagle in a desert puzzle part of the game, yet the player had not attempted a number of intuitive command options that would have worked, but simply looked at the walk-through when the eagle did not immediately notice him, and then simply abandoned the game, thinking he never would have thought of the suggested action from the walk-through.  In a reply thread, he admitted to not even perusing the basic introductory instructions, which would have easily prevented other complaints about L BEHIND not working, as it would in Inform.\r\n\r\nIn Larry Horsfield's defense, I think people nowadays are too quick to toss out the \"guess-the-verb\" complaint without making a good faith effort -- at least it seems so in this case when there were several sensible ways to get the eagle's attention.  \r\n\r\nI fear there is a growing preference for I.F. games to consist merely of using reflex commands (or simply clicking on links) to generate the next chunk of text so as to skim through the story without really thinking through the puzzles.  It seems this kind of player does not actually enjoy puzzles at all, if they can't be bothered to try a few commands (even generic ones would have worked, if he had just thought to try them) before moving on to the next game in the IFComp list and leaving a negative review.\r\n\r\nAlso, complaining about L BEHIND not working even if it works in Inform is an invalid complaint, esp. when the reviewer admits not reading the HINTS or the initial instructions.  That is why they author bothered to put them there -- so that you will know how this particular game works.  \r\n\r\nIt seems unfair to leave negative reviews if you don't take the trouble to get acquainted with the game.  There are any number of reasons to check the instructions first -- game engine standards, exigencies of the game itself and how the created world might limit the parser based on the other puzzles.  You must take the clues provided, take as much help as the author is trying to give, if you really want to judge the game fairly -- and truly enjoy this kind of text adventure.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have thoughts on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Then, my grandpa got me a used CollecoVision with the Atari adapter and a ton of games. My next exposure to videogames was around January of 1991, when I turned 9. Around the same time, I got a shiny new NES and a used Apple2e. That was it for a while. So, during the same period of time, I got my first exposures to playing Final Fantasy, Super Mario 3, and Shadowgate on the NES, and I was learning how to play Sherwood Forest, Nine Princes In Amber, and Where In the World is Carmen Sandiego.\r\n\r\n I enjoy a pretty wide variety of games at this point. And you know what I miss? Freakin' instruction manuals! The first thing I used to do, when I got a new game, was open it up and read that manual cover to cover. They had cool custom artwork, the premise of the story (so you didn't need to sit through that once you actually started playing), basic instructions (so you didn't have to play Tutorial-Land for the first three-quarters of the game), and hints on how to get started (so you weren't just standing on a cliff wondering where to go). Games just don't have any manuals at all anymore, so I'm not surprised there's more and more people who don't read them when they're offered. I think it's a sadly lost piece of the experience.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if someone is kind enough to provide me with instructions, I read them, and I enjoy it. I consider them a part of the game. So, yes, I'd say if someone's complaint could have been solved by _reading_ something that was provided as part of a _text_ adventure, it's their own silly fault if they can't figure out how to phrase an action. \"Guess the verb\" should only be invoked when the necessary phrasing is very specific _and_ unnatural. Frankly, I have absolutely no idea what \"L BEHIND\" even is (sounds like \"god made bananas that way on purpose\" propaganda to me), but it's certainly not the first thing that comes to mind when I think, \"how do I get a bird to notice me?\"\r\n\r\nDag-blern kids today can't appreciate the simple things no more, consarn it!",

At the end of the beach, the path turns down a hill toward the recently refurbished</text-indent>\r\n</br></br><center>\"Super Fancy Modern Aquarium, now with robots!\"</center></br>\r\n\r\nAs you approach the end of the beach, you hear an odd screeching sound. Looking over, you see the back of the aquarium, where it meets the ocean. Just outside the small wall of an aquatic enclosure, a dolphin seems to be swimming in circles and trying to look into the enclosure. The dolphin seems rather desperate about something.\r\n\r\nTaking a closer look at the enclosure, you see that a much smaller dolphin is inside the wall. The dolphin's child must have somehow gotten into the enclosure, and can't figure out how to escape!\r\n\r\nJust as you begin to think, \"well, I'm sure the employees will deal with it,\" you remember that today is Saturday, and the \"fancy\" new aquarium is not open on weekends. That poor dolphin could be trapped all weekend. You have to do something! So, you set your mind to somehow break into the aquarium and free the baby dolphin, but how?\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" you think to yourself, \"the wall isn't that high. Why doesn't the baby just jump over it? Or the mother jump into it? Hmm, well, that seems normal _to me_, but maybe that's something only _trained_ dolphins would think of...\" As you continue to meditate on that thought, you head toward the front of the aquarium.\r\n\r\nQuickly determining you won't get in the front doors, you check the alley along the side the aquarium. Fortunately, there's a side gate you can climb over! Unfortunately, it is guarded by a large angry looking dog. Having seen one too many 80's movies (or perhaps just enough!), you  go to the pharmacy and buy some tranquilizers, then to the grocery store to buy a big steak. You stuff the tranquilizers into the steak, and FEED the STEAK to the DOG. The dog furiously gobbles up the steak. Success! A few moments later, it's sleeping like a lamb, and you climb over the gate into the aquarium grounds.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, you encounter many obstacles and potential deaths, as the \"Super Fancy Modern Aquarium\" does indeed have robots, guard robots, _lethal_ guard robots! There are also various types of doors and locks, including automatic drop gates and magnetic key cards. Eventually, you find the door leading out to the outdoor aquatic enclosure. You can see the poor baby dolphin and it's mother trying to reach each other. Alas! Another locked door! At least this one is just a regular key, but where is it?\r\n\r\nAs you continue to explore the surprisingly dangerous aquarium,  you find a tank marked \"SAMUEL.\" Inside the tank is a rather handsome looking octopus. He seems quite happy with himself. Then you notice the source of his joy: he is clinging to a brightly colored key-chain with words \"OUTDOOR ENCLOSURE\" written on it! (It must be water-proof ink.)\r\n\r\nHaving collected and used a variety of keys already, most of which you no longer need, you try offering a few to Samuel in trade. Sadly, none of them seem to appeal to him more than the one he's got. Fiddlesticks!\r\n\r\nYou explore some more, narrowly escaping death from a particularly mean spirited robot who only shouts \"EX-TER-MIN-ATE!\"  Eventually, you find yourself in the gift shop. They have all kinds of neat stuff, like glasses with whales on them, plastic starfish, and stuffed dolphins. You pick up a stuffed dolphin and hold it, sadly, \"will I ever be able to rescue that poor baby dolphin?\"\r\n\r\nAs you lament your circumstances, you notice they have personalized key-chains, with names on them. In fact, they have some that say \"Samuel!\" You steal a \"Samuel\" key-chain and rush back to the octopus tank, shouting down the annoying robot guards, \"Out of the way, you _Chopping Mall_ rejects!\"\r\n\r\nYou get back to Samuel's tank and call out his name, to see if he recognizes it, and sure enough, he turns to look at you. Nervously, you approach the tank, and show him the \"Samuel\" key-chain, but can an octopus read? Well, perhaps not, as Samuel just seems to look back and forth at you and the key-chain. \"It says 'Samuel' on it,\" you tell him. Now, he's excited! He throws the key to the outdoor enclosure out onto the floor, reaches a tentacle right up out of his tank, and snatches the \"Samuel\" key-chain away from you. He then sits back down, happily admiring his very own personalized key-chain. (You try very hard not to consider the possibility that you could have told anything had his name on it, and he wouldn't have known the difference.)\r\n\r\nYou pick the key, rush to the outdoor enclosure, and finally, you are there, with the baby dolphin. Now, how are you going to get this baby dolphin to jump over that wall? Looking around, you notice a of fish that was carelessly left out... for some reason (Hey, don't look a gift horse in the mouth! I could have made you fight another robot for it!). You pick up the bucket, and now have a limitless supply of fresh (dead) fish.\r\n\r\nNOW, there are two ways this exciting adventure could end, with USE, or without USE. Let's look at without USE first. The text in bold is what the player enters into the parser.\r\n\r\n<center>The Big Ending (without \"USE\")</center></br>\r\nThe baby dolphin watches you carefully. Or is it staring at the bucket of fish?</br>\r\nUSE FISH ON DOLPHIN</br>\r\nUse how?

Picking up speed, you run toward the wall, and the baby dolphin keeps pace with you, all the while keeping its eyes trained on the fish. Just as you are about to reach the wall, you throw the fish into the air and over the wall. The baby dolphin jumps after it, up over the wall and out of the enclosure to the open waters! It happily eats up the fish, as its mother rushes to its side, reunited at last. Congratulations! You freed the baby dolphin!\r\n\r\n<center>The Big Ending (with \"USE\")</center></br>\r\nThe baby dolphin watches you carefully.

The one where you had to puzzle out to TOSS a fish first, then FEED a couple more fish, then LEAD the dolphin with the fish, or the one where you typed \"USE FISH ON DOLPHIN\" four times in a row?\r\n</details>",
