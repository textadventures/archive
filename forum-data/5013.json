There is also a lack of counters and flags in Adrift. Tads was too heavy into programming so Quest seems the better choice.\nI started to use a text generator called Lads years ago simular to what Scott Adams used in the 1980's which is limited to 2 wodds for input. I tried Inform but the result can be unpredictable with the natural programming language.\n\n\nBrian123",

Adrift is indeed too limited.\n\nOne you don't mention is Inform, which hides its &quot;code&quot; in custom syntax.  It makes for a steep learning curve, though I will say that, for as far as I bothered to get into it, it looks like it has some cool functions that, while you can make them work in Quest, are a little more smoothly integrated in Inform.  Of course there are things that are smoother in Quest, as well (adding new verbs/commands in Quest is SOOOO much easier than it is in Inform).\n\nFor me, Quest is the perfect balance between coding and non-coding.  You can make a perfectly decent game without knowing any code at all, and you can make a fantastic game by learning just a little bit at a time.  The fact that Quest also has its own forum, where it's coders frequently come and are willing to answer questions and help trouble-shoot, is also a huge plus.",
