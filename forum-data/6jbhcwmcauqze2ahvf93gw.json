      "EditableText": "So I'm trying to use a counter to set a flag.  Like if the player drinks too much, he becomes drunk.  So each drink adds +1 or +3 depending on the strength of the drink.  And also if the player's counters reaches a certain point, another flag is set to \"really drunk\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm having is that, when the player drinks a shot, it is setting the counter higher, but when I use the 'if' function for \"if player counter reaches 20, then flag 'drunk' is set,\" it's not setting the flag, no matter what I try.  Am I not doing it right? is there a better way to do it?\r\n\r\nI use {if player.flag.flagname:text} in the room descriptions, which is why i want to use flags.",

This is often a simple way to make large projects easier to work with.\r\n\r\nWhen you make a drink, you would give it a 'drink' verb including the line:\r\n```\r\nplayer.drinks = player.drinks + 1\r\n```\r\nand when you make a stronger drink, you could include something like:\r\n```\r\nplayer.drinks = player.drinks + 3\r\n```\r\nbut you don't need to copy the rest of the code into both of these.
