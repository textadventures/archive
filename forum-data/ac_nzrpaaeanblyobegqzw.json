      "EditableText": "Hi! I'm currently making Los Dangerous and I want to imply a feature, but I have some problem.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make player be able to play poker. First, player enters the amount he'll bid, then he plays it and with a random chance, he wins four times of money (as it's played by four people on the table) or loses it. Depending on the amount put in the bid, there are three different conditions in an if/else if/else structure. If player bids more than the amount of money he/she has or it is under a specific value (I chose 50), player can't play poker.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem is that when I get the input (result), it takes the input as string, so it can't compare string to an integer value (player.money). So, how can I convert result to an integer so it can compare it with player money?",
