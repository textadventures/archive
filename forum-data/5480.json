This intro game in the picture is simply named player.\n\nJust click on the player in the circle I've drawn and move it to whatever room/object you want the player to start in when you start your game.  Let me know if that helps.  \n\nEDIT:  And, if by some chance, you have deleted your player.  Add an object to the game and name it player or whatever name you want - make sure you click on Type and choose from whatever option you want.  Click on 'game' in the object room pane (far left), then click on the 'Player' tab on the right and choose the player object.\n\n[attachment=0:255f8idx]<!-- ia0 -->Player drag.jpg<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:255f8idx]",
