I guess I'm touchy on this - I've had to deal with 40 years of coders writing elegant but incomprehensible code, code with is difficult to decipher and frustrating to support.

It's simple and with a little JS functionality, it provides an ease of use for a randomized adventure game that can be played over and over.
