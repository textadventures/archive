This is probably the first ever q&amp;a forum I've been to that was actually helpful.\n\nI've looked through all the pages in the Q5 forum because I figured this had been asked before. At least I thought I saw it but if I did I can't find it again. Now, I realize there is a &quot;print centered message&quot; option, which I've been using, but is there any way to default it? I kind of want all display text centered: objects, room descriptions, commands, pretty much everything. I know you can do some of that separately with the &quot;centered message&quot; option, but can I set it up to where the game automatically centers all text?\n\nAlso, on the subject of time. Is there a way to set a clock and have something happen or someone show up at a precise time? I'm sure there is, but I can't quite figure out how I would do that. \n\nLastly, I want to make a chest to put inventory items for safe keeping and let the player take them back out again when they want. How do I do this?\n\nI'm almost certain I'll have more questions at some point. It seems inevitable. Thankfully this program is set up so even the likes of me can figure out alot of stuff on their own. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> But thanks for answering my questions, you guys are amazing.",
