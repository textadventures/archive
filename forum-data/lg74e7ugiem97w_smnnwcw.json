I assume from the description that you are using the `ShowMenu` function, but there is very little reason to do that unless you want to show a menu.\r\n\r\nDo you want to hide a menu that has already been shown? In that case you could do:\r\n```\r\nClearMenu()\r\n```\r\nbut this is done automatically when the player either enters a command or chooses a menu option, so there should be no need to do it manually unless something like a timer is interrupting while a menu is on the screen.\r\n\r\nIf you want a menu to be active but not displayed on the screen (so that the player has to choose an option by typing a number), you could set the appropriate state manually by doing something like:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Pick a colour of the rainbow! Enter a number from 1 (red) to 6 (purple).\")\r\ngame.menuoptions = Split(\"red;orange;yellow;green;blue;purple\")\r\ngame.menuallowcancel = false\r\ngame.menucallback => {\r\n  msg (\"You picked \" + result + \"!\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you want to hide a menu, but leave Quest expecting a response from it, you would do:\r\n```\r\nHideOutputSection(game.menuoutputsection)\r\n```",

The idea is a menu on a laptop and the battery runs out after a few minutes. I wanted the laptop to shutdown and the menu to disappear so you couldn't choose anything but it was still remaining there after the laptop shutdown using various commands/scripts but it's gone now. So thanks again.",
