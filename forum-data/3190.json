      "EditableText": "When you play a game online, all the game logic runs on the server. When you enter a command, that is sent to the server, the server processes it, and then sends the text output to the browser. The updating graphic appears automatically after a certain time has elapsed (something like 500ms) if the browser is still waiting for a response from the server.\n\nIn the case of your demo, you have a timer running which executes a script every second. The way timers work online is that the browser waits for the time to elapse, then sends a message to the server. The server then responds with the updated screen, and tells the browser to call again in one second. So this adds an additional delay which is why the game runs slower.\n\nThere's not much you can change in your code to speed this up. For the game to run well it would have to run entirely locally in the browser. It could do this if converted to JavaScript (something which I currently have as an internal beta - I'm not planning to make all games run in-browser though).",
