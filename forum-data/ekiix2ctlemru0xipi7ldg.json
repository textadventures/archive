I have been doing well so far but i am stuck on the bee part with \" Moving Objects during the game .\"  I am not actually sure what the tutorial's goal was but i am pretty sure the point was to make the \"bee\" object not in the game until the window was opened.  However, when i follow the instructions to a T, the bee can be seen in the \"kitchen\" room even before the window is opened.  Is there something i am missing?  Will this problem be fixed later?  Is this supposed to be like this?",
