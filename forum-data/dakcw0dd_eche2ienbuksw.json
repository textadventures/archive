The other possibilities, that I know of, are too heavy a game file, which would not effect you if you are close geographically to Quest website, or have a superior connection, or internet or site difficulties that affect everyone to the same or varying degree. I have not been able to play online my own game for three days, but have downloaded the game, since,  and played with no difficulty. I hope someone else knows more.",
