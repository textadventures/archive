You'd have the code:\r\n```\r\nmsg(\"Orc Health: \"+Orc.Health+\"/\"+Orc.MaxHealth)\r\n```\r\nTo get a display of the current/max health. If the orc has been damaged (Like say, the orc was bitten by a snake before you fight him) you could see \"Orc Health: 48/50\"\r\n\r\nI'd also give the Player an _object_ attribute called Target. This would be the target of their current action; whether it's stabbing, or using a healing spell on an ally, etc.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, when you used Knife on Orc, it'd go:\r\n```\r\nPlayer.Target=Orc\r\nPlayer.Target.Health=Player.Target.Health-5\r\nif Player.Target.Health<=0:\r\nmsg(\"The \"+Player.Target.alias+\" dies!\")\r\n```\r\nThis way, you can have the player attack, and damage, just about anything as long as it has a Health attribute.\r\n\r\nThat is, of course, just the bare bones.
