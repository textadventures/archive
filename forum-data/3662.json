The main problem is that the current code Quest code is written with the assumption that if you want the grid map, you have it on from the beginning. So, for example, there is some code that only exists in StartGame, which would have to be done at the right time, when the map is shown. There is also the problem of what exactly should happen when the grid is turned on and off, especially if you have moved in the meantime while it's off. The gridmap code (again) assumes that you are using the gridmap right from the beginning, and it grows the map step by step as you move. It does *not* do well with anything that deviates from that.\n\nI have code that will traverse, layout and draw the entire map up front. If that's sufficient, then that code can be worked in perhaps. If you still want it to be an incremental discovery, then the above mentioned problem will need to be addressed somehow.\n\nI'll take a look at it when I'm less sleepy... <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
