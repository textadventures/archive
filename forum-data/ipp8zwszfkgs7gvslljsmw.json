      "EditableText": ">Did you seriously make a wiki just for this game?\r\n\r\nOh, definitely.  \r\n\r\nIt's pretty much the online game manual.\r\n\r\nI thought people may not be able to figure out exactly what to do (and what all CAN be done), so I made a wiki in an attempt to cover all of this (and so I can use it as a reference later, when I don't remember how to get through the game myself).\r\n\r\n---\r\nYou can enter HINT at any time during play for clues concerning nearly everything in the room.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThere are also Quests.  You just enter QUEST (or click on \"Active Quests\" in the pane) to see a list of all active and completed Quests.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe Quest PX you are carrying receives alerts during play.  These alerts will definitely help you along the way.\r\n\r\nThe PX does other things, too.  You can view all of your bookmarked forum posts, and get a list of available commands.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**NOTE ABOUT THE POSTS:**\r\n\r\nIf you're playing online, the posts don't really work.  You just get a screenshot of the important part of the post you're viewing.  If you're using the desktop player, you are actually visiting this site in the game.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### **If you are playing on a mobile device or tablet...**\r\n\r\nYou're missing out on quite a few bells and whistles, but it shouldn't effect things *too* much.  \r\n\r\nPlaying in the desktop player is what I highly recommend.  \r\n\r\nThe online player doesn't act quite right after loading a saved game.  Things that should be centered are no longer centered and other little things like that.  (What's up with that, Pixie?  Can I fix it?  (It's a mystery to me.  I'm just using ```<center>...</center>```.))\r\n\r\n---\r\nThere's a crappy map of my world on the wiki, which lists all the important items in my parts of the game.\r\n\r\nThere's a page that tells you how to score all of my points, as well.\r\n\r\nAnother page is called \"The Things You Can Do\".\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf you speak to KV, you'll be presented with a menu of the things my NPC will respond to.  (Some of these responses will help you along your way.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhat else?\r\n\r\nYou can enter REAL HELP for some actual help.\r\n\r\nUm...\r\n\r\n---\r\n>I also noticed you used the forum into the game. Really nice by the way, very smart.\r\n\r\nThank you, thank you.  We're glad you like it!\r\n\r\n> But is that supposed to help The Pixie for something greater, or something else?\r\n\r\nYou will need to examine one of the forum posts to progress through one of the puzzles.\r\n\r\nThat's the only clue I'm allowed to give concerning that bit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n>The point?\r\n\r\nLet's not get existential.\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, seriously...\r\n\r\n---\r\n>More to frustrate him than anything else...\r\n\r\n(laughing maniacally)\r\n\r\n>Some areas are easy, some are hard, some require skills beyond the average player...\r\n\r\nAgain, enter HINT.

You just enter QUEST (or click on \"Active Quests\" in the pane) to see a list of all active and completed Quests.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Quest PX you are carrying receives alerts during play.  These alerts will definitely help you along the way.</p>\n<p>The PX does other things, too.  You can view all of your bookmarked forum posts, and get a list of available commands.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>NOTE ABOUT THE POSTS:</strong></p>\n<p>If you're playing online, the posts don't really work.  You just get a screenshot of the important part of the post you're viewing.  If you're using the desktop player, you are actually visiting this site in the game.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>If you are playing on a mobile device or tablet...</strong></h4>\n<p>You're missing out on quite a few bells and whistles, but it shouldn't effect things <em>too</em> much.</p>\n<p>Playing in the desktop player is what I highly recommend.</p>\n<p>The online player doesn't act quite right after loading a saved game.  Things that should be centered are no longer centered and other little things like that.  (What's up with that, Pixie?  Can I fix it?  (It's a mystery to me.  I'm just using <code>&lt;center&gt;...&lt;/center&gt;</code>.))</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There's a crappy map of my world on the wiki, which lists all the important items in my parts of the game.</p>\n<p>There's a page that tells you how to score all of my points, as well.</p>\n<p>Another page is called \"The Things You Can Do\".</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you speak to KV, you'll be presented with a menu of the things my NPC will respond to.  (Some of these responses will help you along your way.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What else?</p>\n<p>You can enter REAL HELP for some actual help.</p>\n<p>Um...</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also noticed you used the forum into the game.
