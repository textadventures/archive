I think this makes it far more accessible, and I think we saw a sudden increase in new users when it started. Suddenly people could just click on a tab at the top of the screen, and there is the forum. However, there are features that I miss.\r\n\r\n**Personal messages:** An important use of PMs is to discuss game bugs. If I play a game, and spot an issue, I could message the creator and let him know. Okay, I could leave a comment, but I feel it is better to keep the dirty washing hidden away. I do not want to be \"that guy\" who fills the comments with critisms, and I wonder if that puts other people off too. Similarly, when people have asked for comments on their games, I have in the past sent a PM. In a similar vein, PMs are better for beta-testing. The alternative is exchanging e-mails, whichI would prefer not to do in open forum.\r\n\r\n**Upload images:** A picture paints a thousands words, and can be especially useful when trying to show how to script in the GUI, or to show-off a new layout for quest, or to show how a layout is failing to do what you want.\r\n\r\n**Upload files:** We now have no way to share library files, and this seems to me a bad thing. It has also been useful for someone with a problem to upload their game for others to see.\r\n\r\nI feel all of these would improve the quality of Quest game.\r\n\r\n",
