      "EditableText": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI have an elevator in game that has the following code: \r\n```if (TownHallElevatorKeyCard.parent = player) {\r\n  msg (\"You insert your keycard and call the elevator.\")\r\n  SetTimeout (2) {\r\n    MoveObject (player, TownHall)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You approach the elevator but there is no call button. Only a slot for a keycard.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically: it teleports the player to a room that is \"on top\" (as seen by the map).\r\n\r\nThis all works fine but as soon as I enter the new room, I cannot click any hyperlinks in the room description/ the \"you can see\"/ \"you can go\" Until I take a turn (enter something in the command line)\r\n\r\nI tried clearing the screen and reprinting the descriptions but that doesn't work\r\n\r\nAny ideas?",
