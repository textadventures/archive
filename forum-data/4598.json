This means that, unless I uncheck the &quot;use default prefix&quot; box and manually fill in a prefix of my own (in all of my objects), I get nothing as a prefix in the message above, thus: &quot;You don't want to carry closet around.&quot;\n\nDo I need to do this manual job? How come the default prefix appears in other cases, e.g. in &quot;You can see...&quot; description headers?\n\nThanks in advance!\nG.",
