(I hope I interpreted what you wanted to do from what you said - able to set attributes to values.)\n\nThe basic idea is to have a page that shows the current states of the desired variables. There are links to script-only pages that update the variables (either incrementing or decrementing) and then route back to the main stats page so the player can see the change. You would also want a link that takes you on to the rest of the game once the stats are set.",
