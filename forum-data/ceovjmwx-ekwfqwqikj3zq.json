Right now i'm making an object in the player's inventory called '(Action) Look Around'. When used, it's meant to print \"Objects of interest include Object1, Object2, and Object3.\" with the three objects being objects in the room and having hyperlinks so they can be interacted with. \r\n\r\nI'm currently using the web browser version of Quest, so I apologise if my problem is an issue with that.\r\nWhat my problem is exactly, is that i'm having trouble getting FormatObjectList to work properly. \r\n\r\nIn the player object's inventory is an object called '(Action) Look Around'. This object has a verb called 'Look Around'. When used, this verb is supposed to run a script which calls a function -  FormatObjectList. \r\n\r\nThe parameters are: \r\n\"You can see\", player.parent, \"and\", \"in this room.\", false\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to print the objects in the same room as the player object (with hyperlinks), but when I attempt to use it in-game, it prints:\r\n> look around (Action) Look Around\r\nError running script: Too many parameters passed to FormatObjectList function - 5 passed, but only 4 expected\r\n\r\nWhat am I getting wrong and how can I get it to work? I'll include some reference images.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Y4C6DMf\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
