If you want to praise other text based programs, please go to their websites and do it... [i:foumb5xn]Thank You.[/i:foumb5xn]\n\n\nDear Alex,\n\nAs I have told you in the past, I tried building a text-based game about 20 yrs. ago, when I was 11/12.  There was no internet to get info or buy books from.  It was: if the library had a book or the bookstore had a book or could order one, then you could get it.  But how does a 11/12 year old ask for a book when that 11/12 year old doesn't know what he's looking for?  \n\nMy dad bought his family an Atari 800XL computer.  Yah, this [i:foumb5xn]was[/i:foumb5xn] a long time ago!  He had a friend, Hank, who would come over with &quot;floppy discs&quot; and copy games for us.  On these disks, I discovered text-based games like &quot;Zork,&quot; &quot;Zork II,&quot; &quot;Ghost Town,&quot; &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; and some others.  There was even one with motionless graphics about a vampire and a castle-like mansion.  I played them and had fun, but I decided I wanted to make one.\n\nI found a book teaching the language BASIC.  I learned code lines, such as: 10 CLEAR; 20 PRINT; 30 GOTO 10....  I can't remember the language now, but I knew enough to be able to write a very static text-based game... well, almost a game.  I had maybe 7 rooms with descriptions and directions, but could never figure out how to manipulate objects, like: take away objects and give them to a player, etc.  I tried finding more books, but no bookstore could help me.  I got bummed, gave up, but the dream found a safe spot in my mind and waited.\n\nLast year, it dawned on me: the internet... text-based games... Zork!  I bet I can download it... and finally solve the game...!  To my pleasant surprise: I found it.  Then I remembered my game.  Yep, I thought, somebody has to have a site about how to encode a text-based game.  That's how I found Quest!  Using Google, I did find other text-based program sites, but felt more comfortable with the way Quest was presented.  I am 100% glad I have chosen Quest and am glad to be a part of the quest to make Quest a better program.\n\nFrom time to time, Alex, out of the blue, the happiness I feel of finally resolving my childhood dream will spark, and every time it does, I silently thank you.  In fact, I just had a vacation from work, and my vacation was building my game... I'm talking about from 7am to 10pm, 3 days straight.\nYah, I've got 20 years of game writing to catch up on, so you can bet that I'm working hard on my game, and having fun in the process.  I at least owe you and your system a good game, and positive advertising to boot.\n\n\nWith deepest and heart-felt warm gratitude,\n\n-David",
