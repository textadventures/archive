So far I just made tons of notes on actual physical paper, somekind of brainstorming my ideas and I'm wondering if you have done something like that, too?! For a character creation  so complex you must have in mind how certain if not all items in your game should look like (stats, equip restrictions, and so forth..)?</p>\n<p>Thanks for the link and game tips, I'll check it out (I do know Maniac Mansion, but Shadowgate rings no bell)! And don't worry about your code, I'm just staring with coding from 0, so i wouldn't recognize bad code if it was right in front of me, haha.</p>\n\n",
