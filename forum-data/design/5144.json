(I think being highlighted on the Text Adventures home page is hugely responsible for that, and I can't thank Alex enough.) But I can attempt to answer your questions. You seem to have two distinct sets, so I'll give my thoughts on them separately.\n\nFirst, if I had to list an &quot;ultimate&quot; goal, it would be to create games that bridge my passions for writing/reading with game play/interactivity in a way that appeals to a large audience (which would include, first and foremost, my wife, kids, parents and friends). And getting money for it would be great as well! There's a lot there, and I'm just at the beginning stage, that of trying to make games that I want. HK has it right there - make games that you enjoy. And if they're quality, others will too, hopefully. So I'm trying for now just to get things made that I would want to play, with the hope that some others out there will want to play them and enjoy them as well. I'm fortunate enough to be able to &quot;roll my own&quot; engines, so I can try to tailor things to what I want, with the added responsibility of *having* to tailor things to what I want.\n\nOn the money side - well, who knows? This is the age of the indie game developer, where the Internet and the wide availability of tools and distribution channels make it possible for anyone to put together a game and get it in front of the masses. The problem is that a lot of people are doing that, so making your signal rise above the noise might be tricky. But there are smaller audiences that have more direct channels, and that leads to your second question:\n\nHow do you get plays and reviews? I sense some frustration there, but I don't think the situation is bleak. \n\nFirst, if you have an unreleased game, releasing it in the context of one of the various IF competitions is a great way to get your work in front of eyes and get reviews. From what I have seen, games entered in the competitions get numerous reviews - brutally honest ones, in fact.\n\nIf you have an existing game or one that doesn't fit the comps or one that you just want to release outside the comps for whatever reason, then I think announcing it in the various IF forums will help at least get some eyes on it.

There is even a web site (<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://if.game-testing.org/\">http://if.game-testing.org/</a><!-- m -->) where you can put your game out for people to volunteer to test. I've been a tester once through that site. Others just announce the need for testers here on textadventures, and people will step forward out of curiosity and a desire to help. Also, announcing a testing phase indicates your serious about your game, which boosts it in people's eyes.\n\nIf you're asking how to make your game visible to the world at large (e.g. via mobile phone distribution or other internet channels), I don't have any experience in that area yet, so you might need to look around a bit or keep asking. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nI must say that it feels like IF has penetrated into the mass market to some extent now once again, with recent releases of games mentioned in the New York Times like Emily Short's &quot;Blood and Laurels&quot; and Inkle Studios' &quot;80 days&quot;, voted Time magazine's 2014 best game of the year.
