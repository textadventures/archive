The NPCs all have their own schedule while on the ship - they can go to the weapons range to practice, to the observatory to stargaze, etc in accordance to a Clock object's Clock.Minute and Clock.Hour.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the recent thread 'What makes a strong NPC' I saw one of the listed qualities is 'The NPC doesn't move around pointlessly' so now I'm having doubts about this feature.\r\n\r\nMy question to you is - should I add a toggle-setting that Enables/Disables NPC Wandering aboard the ship? There's no wandering anywhere else.",
