      "EditableText": "So, I want to begin my next phase of my game and it deals largely with combat.  There are roughly 25-ish rooms and I would like to have about 8 or 9 encounters with monsters that must be slain or, maybe, outwitted.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking a few of those need to be beaten with brute force (basic melee), a couple more easily defeated with a magic spell or two, and a couple that are more like puzzle battles (reminiscent of the dragon-ice encounter in Zork).\r\n\r\nMy question is... is there a library that I could download for these specifics or would I be better off creating something from scratch?  \r\n\r\nKeep in mind:\r\n1.   I intend to lock all exits in the room except the one that was entered from (so the player can retreat).  Retreating resets the monster.   \r\n2.  There will be only a few weapons and a few spells.  The player will either have armor pieces or not.  Very basic defense.  Shield.  Chest Piece.  Or not.  Depends on if the player can complete a side quest to get it.\r\n3.  It will be turn based.  So, I attack monster (or take a turn), monster attacks me.  Repeat until one of us is dead.  So, monster will require HPs and some component of attack power.  \r\n4.  I would like the player to know how many HPs the monster has remaining.  Opponent strength/power need not be known.\r\n\r\nSo, back to the question.  Library or scratch?  I don't mind trying to build something that suits my needs but if there is something out there I could use that fits my design/plans, I'd hate to reinvent the wheel and waste a lot of time.  I looked at (didn't complete the trial game) Pixie's Library, but it seems WAY more than what I need.  Right?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nXanMag",
