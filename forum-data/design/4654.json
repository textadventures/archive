      "EditableText": "Silver, you could always use the standard, but less widely known port (left), starboard (right), stern (back) and bow (front) of the ship.  Much like the cardinal directions, no matter which way the player came about getting to it's present location, he still has to go in either of those directions (And I guess up and down, not sure of those exact terms... possibly above deck and below deck, a deck meaning any floor, not just outside the hull...  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: --> ) and it matters not what cardinal direction or nautical term/coordinates the ship is traveling.  Go right of the ship, forward of the ship, etc. could also be used.\n\nI do not think players in general will grasp the concept immediately, but it is not much different than actually telling the player to go West, East, South or North, they just do.  Obviously give the info to the player when they start or in the help/info/about section what each nautical/space term means.

I am trying to make the details in it as complete as possible, but with out over whelming the player. I want those who already know the type of game to enjoy it, while others who are not familiar with it to as well and it is the latter I am trying to cater to.\n\nFor instance, in my head I want the player to draw upon the items in their room so I try to describe it by the cardinal directions of where is what. However, looking at it from a new person perspective, seeing all these Ns, SEs, NWs, Es, etc., might be too over whelming and I have not played enough TAs (Not T&amp;A...   ) to really know the proper or less migraine inducing way to go about it. I am more into “On your right is a dresser and directly in front of you is your bed...”, but then in reality that depends on which way you came into the room or how you started your game.\n\nTo me the cardinal directions make it very explicit where everything is and yet, is it truly necessary for the player? Is just telling the player what is in the room enough and let them place all the objects where they want in their head for the most part? Obviously the most basic things are needed, but do I need to purposely state which corner or which wall this and that is? Also I do not like hyperlinks as much, so I may not have things obvious to the player. In the Info/About/Help file I will explain as much as I can on how a TA works and mine specifically, but I still do not want something to be missed, nor do I want hyper links or even things not needed to be seen on the right hand side of the screen. I like the Novella (SP?) game engine, but I do in fact want some stuff still on the right. Possibly just the compass buttons or Inv for easy access.\n\nBut now I am getting off topic, below in an example of what I am talking about. How does it fair with you as a veteran TAer, but also taking the time to put yourself in the shoes of a new player?\n\n[This is your bedroom. It is very familiar to you since it has been your room since you were a baby. There is a bed in the SE corner, with a night stand directly next to it. On the W wall there is a dresser and on the E a window. A standing mirror occupies the SW corner and in the NW there is a rather large wardrobe. There is also the balcony to the S and your door leading to the hallway to the N.]\n\n[Your bed is a queen canopy bed that is rather large for you, but some day you feel you will grow into. It has pink silk sheets with pink pillows and soft purple blankets.]\n\n[Pink silk sheets. Some times you like to run and jump into bed, sliding along the soft smooth sheets as you do so.]\n\n[Purple blankets. You can get cold rather easily and these heavy woven blankets always seem to keep you warm, even on the coldest nights.]\n\n\nAbove has the parent room, with the bed being a parent of the blanket and the sheets. Is describing the sheets and blanket on the parent bed, as in color too much, since when they examine the sheets and blanket themselves, more descriptions will be shown? At the same time though, initially scanning over an object would reveal the color of the sheets and blankets anyway. (Although the same could be said with the room description as you look around...)\n\nHow do you think I should proceed? This is only one instance of many that I have done so far. I am going through and proof reading what I already have... You know having an in-game spell/grammar checker/thesaurus would be of great help...   and I do not want to get all the way through and then think... you know what... to help everyone I should really change everything. Although the descriptions would primarily stay the same, just where they are located in said room is the issue or the extra descriptions on top of the norm.\n\nThank you.[/quote:1n5yordy]",

Some times you like to run and jump into bed, sliding along the soft smooth sheets as you do so.]<br/><br/>[Purple blankets. You can get cold rather easily and these heavy woven blankets always seem to keep you warm, even on the coldest nights.]<br/><br/><br/>Above has the parent room, with the bed being a parent of the blanket and the sheets. Is describing the sheets and blanket on the parent bed, as in color too much, since when they examine the sheets and blanket themselves, more descriptions will be shown? At the same time though, initially scanning over an object would reveal the color of the sheets and blankets anyway. (Although the same could be said with the room description as you look around...)<br/><br/>How do you think I should proceed? This is only one instance of many that I have done so far. I am going through and proof reading what I already have... You know having an in-game spell/grammar checker/thesaurus would be of great help...   and I do not want to get all the way through and then think... you know what... to help everyone I should really change everything. Although the descriptions would primarily stay the same, just where they are located in said room is the issue or the extra descriptions on top of the norm.<br/><br/>Thank you.</blockquote>",

      "EditableText": "Hmm, you can give an alias to your exits in Quest, but I noticed that makes the direction buttons stop working. That's a bummer because I like the direction buttons. Plus, I'm not sure how hard it would be to consistently make easy-to-type movement commands across the game. No one wants to have to type &quot;go toward starboard&quot; every time. Even if the buttons did remain available, I think some people like to use the keyboard.\n\nLike, I had a part in the game I'm working on where the player character is in the &quot;square&quot; of a village, there are three directions you can go, and two of those directions where into a building. I wanted the automatic room description to say something like, &quot;You can [u:z6mjojtt]north[/u:z6mjojtt], [u:z6mjojtt]into the store[/u:z6mjojtt], or [u:z6mjojtt]into the church[/u:z6mjojtt],&quot; with hyperlinks. That was easy to do. I wanted the player to be able to click the left arrow button to go into the store. That was no problem. I wanted the player to be able to type &quot;w&quot; or &quot;west&quot; or &quot;go into the store&quot; and any of those options would make you end up in the store. I was able to make that happen too. The problem is that I couldn't make it have all those options. So going into the store is referred to as going west, and it sounds super weird.\n\n[quote:z6mjojtt]Thanks Khan and Jay. I laughed at the feng-shui remark by the way  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: --> and everything you said does make sence. However now I have another question... how would you make the player move in the same exact room, but closer to the TV? I can not grasp that concept. One room, the player is already standing in it, unless it is a rather large room like a dinning/livingroom kind of set up. Why would you force the player to move &quot;towards&quot; the TV though? What purpose would it serve? Why not just &quot;turn it on&quot; as it were from where they are standing, since in essence they are standing virtually any where with in the room itself.\n\nI ask this because a second game I had started making, due to my original was still on the back burner at the time, has a character in an outdoor environment, that is virtually limitless. Now I can have them type north and simply &quot;be&quot; in front of the destination. But I wanted to project how really far this place was but with out going overboard with it, so I was forcing the player to go N a few times and while writing the story or their environment make it seem like they are half way there and will have them go further north a ways and have them arrive, but make it seem (Or I hope anyway.) like they traveled a great expance.[/quote:z6mjojtt]\n\nI think you're on the right track. Definitely think of &quot;room&quot; metaphorically. Like a &quot;room&quot; is the amount of space wherein the amount of movement you have to do to get between the different objects is negligible. \n\nLike, to use the living room and TV example two different ways:\n\nNormally, you'd have a living room be one room in a TA game. Realistically, most living rooms are big enough that you'd have to walk around to interact with things on opposite walls, but that amount of walking isn't significant enough to actually be a game action. The player just understands that this walking occurred. If you want, you could mention it in the narration, e.g. the command &quot;turn on tv&quot; gives text such as, &quot;You walk over to the TV and turn it on,&quot; but it's not necessary--and probably not desirable in most cases. I think a good rule of thumb for the narration mentioning stuff like that is whether a person would think about doing it. Normally people walk so much that they don't think about taking a few steps like that, so you wouldn't describe it for the same reason you wouldn't describe the character breathing constantly. But if there's a bunch of junk on the floor he's got to step over, or if his ankle hurts, or if he's ticked off that he can't find the TV remote, then you might want to mention it.\n\nAlternatively, even though the living room is a single room story-wise, you could make it two (or more) rooms in terms of game structure. You could have the north half of the living room and the south half of the living room be a separate game room. If the TV is in the south half, the player can't turn it on while he's in the north half. BUT he can still see the TV from the north half, so you'd probably want it in the room description of both rooms, and you'd want to actually make a TV object in each room, even though there's only one TV in the story. That way you could make &quot;look at TV&quot; work in both sections, but things like &quot;turn on TV&quot; or &quot;take TV&quot; can have a different result depending on which half of the living room you're in. If you're using Quest's map system, I think you can make the exits have a length of 0 to put rooms right next to each other, so it looks like they are part of one room.\n\n(I think that second example, as it's described, is kind of dumb and would just annoy the player. There probably wouldn't be a good reason, in terms of game design, to divide a living room up in that exact way. BUT there would be other situations where it would be a good idea, such as outdoor areas or very large rooms.)\n\nAnother thought for giving the impression of distance without making the player choose north ten gazillion times and read ten gazillion slightly reworded descriptions of grass.... Just put a &quot;room&quot; at each end of the area, and use the text to describe the distance the character traveled to get from one to the other. You'd probably want this as &quot;once&quot; text in the room description, or with the &quot;before entering the room for the first time&quot; room script. However, I always have trouble describing travel. If you tell the player they traveled x miles or walked for x hours, but it only takes them half a second to read, I think it's not really going to feel like a long distance. Back when I tried to write adventure novels, the tactics that felt like they worked were to either have characters conversing during the travel or describe what the character is thinking about during the travel, but I'm not sure either of those work very well for TA games. Still, this might be a way to handle long hallways, big empty fields, or other such large areas where all the stuff in the middle isn't really important.",

This means the default requirement to 'take sandwich' is bypassed.<br/><br/>Here's the scripts I use:<br/><br/>Room script&#058;<br/><pre><code>if (ListContains(ScopeVisible(), sandwich)) {<br/>  msg (&quot;You are in a kitchen&#46; There is a table here, on top of which sits a fresh sandwich&#46;&quot;)<br/>}<br/>if (not ListContains(ScopeVisible(), sandwich)) {<br/>  msg (&quot;You are in a kitchen&#46; There is a table here&#46;&quot;)<br/>}</code></pre><br/>And the 'eat sandwich' command script&#058;<br/><pre><code>firsttime {<br/>  msg (&quot;Yum yum!&quot;)<br/>  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;eaten&quot;)<br/>  MakeObjectInvisible (sandwich)<br/>}<br/>otherwise {<br/>  if (GetBoolean(player, &quot;eaten&quot;)) {<br/>    msg (&quot;You already ate it&#46;&quot;)<br/>  }<br/>}</code></pre>",
