Like my example for instance. It assumes the player is ready to leave the apartment, when it's more than likely they would want to explore their current location first. There's nothing to stop them doing this once they've picked up the items, of course, but what I'm essentially doing here is forcing the player to do things.\n\nI think maybe this style would work better on CYOA type games.",

In the case of your example, it might be a good idea to use that style of unfolding descriptions if e.g. the player's character is late for work or otherwise in a rush. I imagine it'd be suitable if a character is gradually recovering their consciousness after being asleep/incapacitated too.\n\nI have a scene in the project I'm working on, where the player enters a room and it is described as being (more or less) empty, causing the character to turn around, whereupon they notice a hooded figure standing next to the doorway. Most of the encounter in that room revolves around speaking to the figure (you can't leave without speaking to them, in fact), so there isn't much time devoted to describing the room itself. The room appears different, and can be examined as usual if the player returns later, though - perhaps this is similar to the idea you mentioned?\n\nEven if it's not a style I'd personally want to see used all the time, I can definitely see its use in areas where you want to change the pace of the narrative.",

Now, if I play the game enough, or multiple times, then I might eventually realize that the description is coming out in stages on each command, which would probably prompt me just to type &quot;z&quot; (wait) over and over to make all the text play out before I did anything. In other words, the game would be withholding information (at first) that I might need to make the best choice about how to proceed.\n\nWhat you could do perhaps (though I'm not sure how with Quest) would be to have a &quot;short&quot; description when you enter the room, and then if the player types &quot;look&quot; or &quot;l&quot;, then they get a full description. That's not too bad a system, as the player will probably quickly learn that they can get a fuller description with an explicit look. \n\nI would definitely not include any key information in that more verbose description. Otherwise, again, you're just forcing the player to explicitly look in order to know everything about where they are, which is often critical to deciding the next command.",
