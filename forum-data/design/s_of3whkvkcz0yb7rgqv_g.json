It was like a virtual stack of cards that you could add sound, text, images, buttons to. You can link cards together with hotspots or buttons. You can do scripting. You can make whatever you want.\r\n\r\nThe original Myst was prototyped in HyperCard. Cyan's first two games (pre-Myst) were made in HyperCard: The Manhole and Cosmic Osmo. \r\nhttps://youtu.be/YyOTq1EpV5o\r\nhttps://youtu.be/K30UmVsqTn8\r\n\r\nThere are some aesthetic limitations (that I think make it interesting). It has 1-bit vintage Macintosh style graphics (pixels are either black or white, no grays). It has 8-bit low sampling rate audio limited to 10 seconds per clip (but clever programming can have longer audio).\r\n\r\nI'm not the creator of Decker, I'm just someone excited to use it. For me it's like what I always wanted Twine to be.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have a large userbase yet, but you can see some examples of Decker projects here: https://itch.io/jam/decktember/entries\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just thought you should be aware of this. It's so cool.",
