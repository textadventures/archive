Beached! is the first in a series of games and it was a tryout to see if I could actually program an IF game from scratch. Since my native language is Dutch and my English is not sufficient enough to write a proper IF game for all to enjoy, **I need help!**\r\n\r\n**Beached! (part 2)** is in development. The scenario has been written but I need someone to check the story line for grammar and spelling errors and turn it into proper spoken language. Even though it's IF, the amount of text is not overwhelming and anyone is welcome to help me on this. I'm not looking for a co-writer, but sharing new ideas on the scenario or puzzles is always appreciated.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, play [**Beached! (part 1)**](www.beachedadventure.com) as a reference to the amount of text and the grammar problems.\r\n**Please help make Beached! (Part 2) a full-grown game!**\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nEwald\r\n\r\n",
