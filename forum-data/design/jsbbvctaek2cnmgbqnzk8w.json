After several days of trying everything I could think of,  I contacted the Author of game (he had included his email). I explained where I was and asked for just a little nudge to get me going.

(had to be on pillow and not just drop them)\r\n2) Fill vase with water from pond behind castle. There were 3 small ponds and it had to be from the center pond ONLY.\r\n3) Go to Worship Chamber and place filled vase in hands of statue.\r\n4) Left of statue light ONLY the candles in the even numbered position (there were 6 candles on each side of statue)\r\n5) Right  of statue light ONLY the candles in the odd numbered positions.\r\n6) Go to Kings Chamber. The wall that had a tapestry was now replace with a wall with a door behind the tapestry.\r\n\r\nSeriously? Would any of you have ever thought of doing those steps in that exact order? I doubt it. I bet many of you have had similar situations or even did it yourself in a game you made.\r\nPLEASE use some common sense and remember that not everyone thinks like you.\r\nRant is over - thank you!

I guess what I am getting at is that the puzzle you've mentioned sounds  like a good one IF there were reasonable clues that would lead you to complete those steps.  If there were not, then, I totally agree with you.  \r\n\r\nMy biggest struggle writing games is what you bring up here.  I have no interest in CYOAs as I find them rather dull.  I get much more out of reading a good book.  TAs, to me, are much better because of the challenge in their puzzles.  I try and walk that fine line between making an appropriately challenging puzzle and too difficult/absurd.  I like to \"hide\" (in plain site) clues to puzzles within a bit of text (which you have to be careful not to make too long) or create puzzles that definitely require a bit of logic without being overtly obvious.  It's a tough line to walk sometimes because you are definitely correct - not everyone think's like the author!\r\n\r\nAlso, the second greatest challenge in writing a TA is trying to cover all of the possible ways EVERY player may try to solve a puzzle that makes sense.  For this challenge, an easy solution is hyperlinks, but I feel like those are too great a hint for many of the puzzles so I tend to remove hyperlinks from my game.  The alternative to hyperlinks is often a long and lengthy and frustrating bit of code for something that should seem simple.  Maybe I don't code quite well enough yet, but that, to me is the toughest things about writing games because I know it is SUPER frustrating to know what you have to do to succeed as a player but you're not sure how the author coded the task into their game.\r\n\r\nCheck your email.  I've pm'ed you.",
