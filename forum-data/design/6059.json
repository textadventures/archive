I suppose that in theory, small uses could be found for each one, but I'd ideally want the player's inventory not to be cluttered, and for players to be able to easily distinguish between plot-centric or otherwise useful items, and ones that are just there for flavour.\n\nWould players feel that their freedom is being limited too much if an error message were to appear, explaining why the player character doesn't feel the need to pick up a certain item? In the project I'm working on, I'm planning on not having very many items that the player can pick up, but the ones that can be taken potentially have several uses.

Not to mention all of the cheat codes available to undo any critical mistakes due to this freedom, along with fixing/moving NPCs that get stuck or that you cause to get stuck, or if you kill critical npcs, etc etc etc. Making such a cheat/fix system is another huge amount of work on your part).\n\n----------\n\nAs for the other things you mention about&#058;\n\nthere's ways to handle items, you can have a very organized advanced item (+storage) system, vs no such system where your inventory would get cluttered up.\n\nyou can always separate out the quest items from other items (many games have the quest items be non-interactive, they're just displayed to the person and handled internally by the game for the quest events that require them), for example:\n\nitems (these can be interacted with):\n\n-&gt; healing items (life, mana, etc)\n\n-&gt; curing items (status effects removal items)\n\n-&gt; battle items (usable only in battle)\n\n-&gt; etc etc etc item categories\n\nquest items (these can't be interacted with):\n\nblah blah blah items\n\n--------\n\nif you just have default/generic &quot;can't/negative&quot; messages (ie &quot;You can't do that&quot;), it's not as bad, as making them more descriptive and specific (much more work to do this) to the action that you do and the other things involved with it (ie: you can't use the bronze key on the locked gold door).\n\nyou always need some prompting (information to the user), as they need to know what is going on... communication is important, even if it is stale (preferably not though obviously).

I'm considering playing with the idea of player agency in general, in the game I'm working on at the moment, so that was interesting to read.\n\nIt's good to know what the accepted conventions for picking up objects are, too... I agree that generic error messages for something as simple as trying to pick up an object are annoying, and tend to break my immersion. The second approach in your list is the one I was leaning towards myself though, XanMag (I already have custom error messages for anything that can't be taken). Since this will be my first completed project, I'd rather keep things simple and only have a small-ish number of usable inventory items, as the main thrust of the game is based around the character(s) and how the player deals with interactions with them.",
