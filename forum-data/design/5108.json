It's basically an extremely stripped down version of a much bigger project I started years ago. \n\nThe big 'puzzle' to solve is simply making a certain amount of gold in a certain amount of time, and I wanted there to be multiple ways for the player to accomplish that. There's a big focus on crafting and fishing and mining, etc. You gradually earn enough money to buy better tools which allow you to earn [i:2gvv799h]more[/i:2gvv799h] money, which is where my question comes in: is that sort of thing just a tedious slog to most people? I mean while you get different results depending on several factors, you literally are just typing things like 'bait pole with [whatever]' and 'cast line' and 'reel in' over and over.     \n\nDoes typing 'search bushes' five or six times until you luck out and find some eggs in a nest or a rare seed or a rabbit hole sound like a good time? Theoretically all the randomness and the variety of approaches to take in earning gold would give the game a lot of replayability, but then again maybe I'm just in denial and this kind of thing does not work at all in a text game. \n\nThoughts?",
