Talking about biting off more than I could chew.\r\n\r\nBottom line:  I've seen great games like Furby McQuack (har, har, har) that take place all in one room and I've seen great games like Xanadu 2 (hopefully not a har, har, har) with 126 rooms.  Well written stories and unique, tricky puzzles is my thing so a room count isn't all that important.\r\n\r\nLet me know when you need testers!",
