Longer encouraging sound indicating success after significant effort (e.g. completion of  a maze; killing and end-level enemy)\r\n3.

Free as always to use with attribution:\r\n\r\nOn my Horror/Surreal page, we have:\r\n\r\nCREEPY ACTION – (Looping) – This track might sound cool in a quick moving horror game…or perhaps something else that combines action with creepiness. It came out pretty well…if you need something like this, give it a try.\r\nhttps://soundimage.org/horrorsurreal/\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my Puzzle Music 4 page:\r\n\r\nCRYSTAL PUZZLES – (Looping) – This track might sound nice in, well, a puzzle game involving crystals….or perhaps other shimmering objects, light rays, etc. It has a techno feel to it as well. Should sound pretty cool under sound fx.\r\nhttps://soundimage.org/puzzle-music-4/\r\n\r\nBtw, if anyone happens to have kids (or know someone who does) I’ve created a learning series that teaches them environmental stewardship in a fun way through stories and characters. It was my first try at making films with a DSLR…(they can be very challenging to work with in the field)…but I think they came out pretty well. The organization I made them for was very happy with them and uses the films all the time…hopefully others can benefit from them as well. Please feel free to share with teachers, family, friends or anyone you know who might find them useful.\r\n\r\nhttps://soundimage.org/dunes-island/\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

Free as always to use with attribution:</p>\n<p>On my Horror/Surreal page, we have:</p>\n<p>CREEPY ACTION – (Looping) – This track might sound cool in a quick moving horror game…or perhaps something else that combines action with creepiness. It came out pretty well…if you need something like this, give it a try.<br>\nhttps://soundimage.org/horrorsurreal/</p>\n<p>On my Puzzle Music 4 page:</p>\n<p>CRYSTAL PUZZLES – (Looping) – This track might sound nice in, well, a puzzle game involving crystals….or perhaps other shimmering objects, light rays, etc. It has a techno feel to it as well. Should sound pretty cool under sound fx.<br>\nhttps://soundimage.org/puzzle-music-4/</p>\n<p>Btw, if anyone happens to have kids (or know someone who does) I’ve created a learning series that teaches them environmental stewardship in a fun way through stories and characters. It was my first try at making films with a DSLR…(they can be very challenging to work with in the field)…but I think they came out pretty well. The organization I made them for was very happy with them and uses the films all the time…hopefully others can benefit from them as well.
