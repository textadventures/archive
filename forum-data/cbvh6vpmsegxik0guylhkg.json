If I download Quest on to a PC at home, can I work on that same project at school using a memory stick or some other way?\r\n2. Is there a way I could make it so that only certain people can play my game when it is published, for example have a code or something?\r\n3. If you are playing a text adventure game, can you save your progress?",
