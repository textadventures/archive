For doing so, instead of using the usual exits for mimicking game book choices, i created objects to represent different set of choices in the game. I decided doing it to make use of the \"Look at\" verb and use this place to add some information about the options, so players may take informed decisions. You may do the same. However, go to the object's second tab and simply delete the preset verbs like \"Take\" and the \"Look at\", if you don't like it. Then at the Verbs Tab, add those you want using as choices.",
