      "EditableText": "I've checked out the clock library The Pixie created, and it looks pretty good. My only problem is the game I'm working on has a set span of time I'd like to implement. The clock library starts at midnight and can go on for days, but what I'm trying to do is set the game's clock to 10pm and have the player try to escape the room before 6 am or the game ends.\n\nSo about 9 hours of game-time is given to the player to escape, if my math is right. Can the clock library be adjusted to do this or will I have to create a separate set of scripts to handle this, especially since I plan on having the clock be tied to a device the player carries around? I wanted it to display the time while it is on, but not when it is off, yet still keep track of the time.\n\nMostly I wrote this to get my thoughts organized, but if anyone has suggestions, it would be most appreciated. Hmm.",
