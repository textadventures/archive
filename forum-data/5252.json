The second line is about the objects you can take.

If so, do you only want this format at the beginning of the game?\n\nIf both answers are yes... here is my work around - you'll probably get a better answer from a coder, but here it goes.\n\nI made a test game and added a 'Living Room'.  Then I went to: scripts --&gt; Before entering the room for the first time --&gt; added 'show picture', added 'wait for key press' (optional), added a 'print message' and room description.  I also added objects.\nIn the room tab of my 'Living Room' I chose 'run script' in the room description box and I added a 'first time' script where I left the first time script as a blank 'print message' script and filled in the 'otherwise' with my room description.\n\nNow... don't laugh.  This is where my brain takes a totally different turn than 99% of the 'Questers' in this forum.  Hell, it probably already has...\n\nIn the room setup, I clicked in the 'Alias' box and simply hit the space bar once.  When I play the game, I get Picture, 'continue' (on key press), and my first room description, and a list of items in the room.  The only problem is that there will be a period where your alias room name is on game play.  I'm sure there is a way to turn that period the same color as the background to make it invisible or remove it all together but I could not get rid of it.  \n\nCopy that room and change the stuff above to seem like a normal room.  Now, I make a ONE WAY exit out of my starter room (or probably better yet... use a move player to room script upon exiting) in any direction you want to be able to leave the room.  In the rooms that I can exit to, I make a two way exit into my copied (non-start) room.  The player can leave the first room, but when they re-enter it again, it appears that the player has moved back into the starter room.  If you have takeable objects in that first room, that will throw another problem into the mix (if you choose this method, I can give you some non-conventional ways to make it work).\n\nAnyway... that is how I, the King of Befuddlement, would make this work.\n\nHappy gaming!\n\nXanMag",
