It would be a poor game indeed that forced the Player to type \"look object\" or \"look at object\" when his natural inclination is to \"look under,\" \"look in,\" \"look through,\" or \"look out of.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one thing. Not a big deal, but it might annoy some players. Quest seems unable to handle a period at the end of a sentence. \"Examine dresser\" gets the desired response, but \"Examine dresser.\" gets \"I can't see that.\"\r\n\r\nAny way around that very small glitch??",
