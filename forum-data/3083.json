But also, all the other directions are available - and taking any of the other directions (i.e. except for east/west) will take the player to a different room.\n\n  So basically I have something similar to:\n\nwest desert &lt;-w---e-&gt; middle desert &lt;-w---e-&gt; east desert &lt;-w---e-&gt; starting point\n\nBut, in the east desert, any other direction will take the player to 'lost in desert', where all exits (except for south) go to 'lost in desert'. South takes them to the starting point.\n\nI also have a 'mirage' which you get to by a wrong direction from middle desert - it always takes you to 'lost in desert'.\n\nI know that I can set this up with the standard exits - but I wondered if there was a (simple) way to configure this.  Anything too complex is probably not appropriate - since I would like to show this to school children (and at Games Britannia) as an example.\n\nBest wishes\n  Andy Stratton",
