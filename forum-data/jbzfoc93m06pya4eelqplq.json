I wrote it in TADS 3, (not Quest), so I don't know if this group is interested in it.  But it's a classic, funny, puzzle-driven, Infocom-style text adventure. It even has free CyberFeelies(tm) you can download. You can check it out at https://www.thaumistry.com. It's also available on Steam.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n--Bob\r\n",
