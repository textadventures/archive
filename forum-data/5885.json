      "EditableText": "The problem with a typewriter type effect is that it outputs characters one at a time. That means you can't have style attributes or any sort of HTML markup that requires chunks of text.\n\nFor example, let's say you have this: Hello world!&lt;br/&gt;Goodnight moon!\n\nAt some point, it will have printed &quot;Hello world!&quot; and then it will print the &quot;&lt;&quot;, which makes no sense on its own. Then it will print the &quot;b&quot;, which means you have &quot;&lt;b&quot;, and then &quot;&lt;br&quot; and then &quot;&lt;br/&quot;, etc. It's a real mess.\n\nThe way to properly do it would be to parse the text to identify the tags to emit them at once. But even then you'd have to handle pairs like &quot;&lt;b&gt;Foo&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, to know to emit them together around the text, once the text starts to show up. It's not trivial at all. (It could be an interesting programming project, actually.)\n\nAs far as knowing when the typewriter is done, that could be added. I wrote my own similar sort of effect, and I just passed it a function name to invoke when the effect completes. A version of that could be done for typewriter.",
