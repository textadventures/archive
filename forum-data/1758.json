Is it possible to make it where people can play the games that I create with out the quest program?\r\n\r\nI assume all this falls with in the category of getting a customized version of the quest program?\r\n\r\nAlso is there any licensing that needs to be done regarding making commercial games? A couple of weeks ago I sent a e-mail through the website on the contact us page, and I have yet to get a reply. I assume the company never got it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nBigk",
