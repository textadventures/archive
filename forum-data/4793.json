When I type the command &quot;Look&quot; or using the ShowRoomDescription function, how can be achieved that the room description be sent to the top part of the screen?  I mean after having played a while, I know in the beggining is there.\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is not to use the ClearScreen function because then I wont have a transcript of the session and I don't like to show the room description in the middle or lower part of the screen.\n\nPlease help, thank you!",

You'd have to disable that temporarily.\n2) As far as I can see, you can't scroll the bottom of content up beyond the bottom of the window, except in the beginning when there is no scroll bar. That means you'd have to pad the content out (in a non-permanent way) to allow the text to scroll up that high. I have some code that creates a temporary section, fills it with &lt;br&gt;s and then collapses it. This forces the content length but then allows new content come in where it should (since the temporary section goes away). You'd have to figure out the size to make it. That's probably doable, but I don't have all the math down.\n\nSo that's where it is.",
