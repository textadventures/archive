So what I want to do is disable the &quot;You can see [object]&quot; line, but have [object] hyperlinked in the actual description of the room. \n\nI've also run into a bit of trouble with the descriptions. It seems that with longer ones the words sometimes get joined together and I have to proofread and correct a couple of times to make sure they're separate. I think it happens when I edit the text in any way.\n\nThat's it for now. Thanks in advance.",
