I had some scripts which just added picture (which I think caused the problem) and have now set them all to set frame picture ( I already had the the picture frame box ticked under the game object.) Jeez this program is tricky to understand ... but I am determined not to give up and will no doubt be back with some more dumb questions !  Meanwhile many thanks for your help ... got me back on the road again!",
