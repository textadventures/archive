It's too large and I have to scroll side-to-side and up and down a lot to view it all.  In the current state, playing games is kind of unplayable (or at least unenjoyable).  Is there something I can do to correct this or is it a Quest thing?  Thanks.",

Also I have a similar problem running my new game on a laptop when the pictue is far too large for the screen and requires a great deal of scrolling (I mentioned this elsewhere on the forum but have so far received no suggestions)",
