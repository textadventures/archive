      "EditableText": "Thank you, Silver.  It's working now.  \n\nMy next question is also about pictures.  I load a picture with every room.  One picture is a map, but the map details are too small to see.  Therefore, I have told the Quest engine to add the map as an inventory item so that the player can pull it out and look at.  However, looking at the map gives the same result: the picture shows up too small.  Is there a way I can display an enlarged version of a picture, perhaps in a new window?  \n\nI do not have programming experience, so if anyone is willing to tackle this problem, I would appreciate a fairly detailed response, should it be necessary to type code.  Sorry for that, and THANK YOU.",
