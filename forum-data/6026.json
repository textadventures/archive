They can go to PAGE Y from PAGE X, PAGE B, or even PAGE K. My problem is, hos to I get the player to go back to the PAGE they were originally on? I have been trying to mess around with it for about an hour and most options I have to set what page they return to, but there can be several pages and I need them to go back to the right page.\n\nAny advice will be greatly appreciated! Thanks for taking the time to read!",
