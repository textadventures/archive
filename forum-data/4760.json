You can't build a ceiling~roof without walls, you can't build walls without a ground~foundation for constructing a building~home):\n\n[code:q39uu029]&lt;asl&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

/&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  (your entire mass of game code)\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:q39uu029]\n\nnext is our 'game' tag block:\n\nin the GUI~Editor, this is the 'game' (special Object) on the left side's 'tree of stuff', which holds the game's settings~options, which you can set via the tabs on the right side.\n\nand here is what it looks like in code:\n\n[code:q39uu029]&lt;game name=&quot;blah&quot;&gt;\n  (Attribute code lines)\n&lt;/game&gt;[/code:q39uu029]\n\nagain, the ' name=&quot;blah&quot; ' is an attribute for the beginning 'game' tag itself\n\nand then we got the (default) attributes:\n\n[code:q39uu029]&lt;game name=&quot;blah&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;gameid&gt;an_algorithm_generated_unique_string&lt;/gameid&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;firstpublished&gt;2014&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n&lt;/game&gt;[/code:q39uu029]\n\nand additional optional attributes (such as if we set the options~settings within the 'game' special Object via its tabs, in the GUI~Editor):\n\n[code:q39uu029]&lt;game name=&quot;blah&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;gameid&gt;an_algorithm_generated_unique_string&lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;firstpublished&gt;2014&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n  &lt;author&gt;HegemonKhan&lt;/author&gt;\n  &lt;description&gt;the 'blah' game&lt;/description&gt;\n  &lt;subtitle&gt;blah blah&lt;/subtitle&gt;\n  &lt;difficulty&gt;easy&lt;/difficulty&gt;\n  &lt;cruelty&gt;easy&lt;/cruelty&gt;\n  &lt;pov type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;player&lt;/pov&gt;\n  &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n    character_creation_function\n  &lt;/start&gt;\n&lt;/game&gt;[/code:q39uu029]\n\nso, now add in Jay's 'css' tag block into your own 'game' tag block:\n\nthe vertical order placement of the 'css' tag block doesn't matter, but just make sure you indent it (as the indentation tells that it is inside of the 'game' tag block), for example:\n\n[code:q39uu029]&lt;game name=&quot;blah&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;gameid&gt;an_algorithm_generated_unique_string&lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;firstpublished&gt;2014&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n  &lt;author&gt;HegemonKhan&lt;/author&gt;\n  &lt;description&gt;the 'blah' game&lt;/description&gt;\n  &lt;subtitle&gt;blah blah&lt;/subtitle&gt;\n  &lt;difficulty&gt;easy&lt;/difficulty&gt;\n  &lt;cruelty&gt;easy&lt;/cruelty&gt;\n  &lt;pov type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;player&lt;/pov&gt;\n  &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n    character_creation_function\n  &lt;/start&gt;\n  &lt;css&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;\n    &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\n      div#txtCommandDiv {\n        border&#58;none;\n        font-size&#58;12pt;\n        font-family&#58;Georgia, serif;\n      }\n      input#txtCommand {\n        outline&#58;none;\n        border&#58;none;\n        font-size&#58;16px;\n        margin&#58;0;\n        padding&#58;0;\n      }\n    &lt;/style&gt;\n  &#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/css&gt;\n&lt;/game&gt;[/code:q39uu029]\n\nis the same as:\n\n[code:q39uu029]&lt;game name=&quot;blah&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;gameid&gt;an_algorithm_generated_unique_string&lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;firstpublished&gt;2014&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n  &lt;author&gt;HegemonKhan&lt;/author&gt;\n  &lt;description&gt;the 'blah' game&lt;/description&gt;\n  &lt;subtitle&gt;blah blah&lt;/subtitle&gt;\n  &lt;css&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;\n    &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\n      div#txtCommandDiv {\n        border&#58;none;\n        font-size&#58;12pt;\n        font-family&#58;Georgia, serif;\n      }\n      input#txtCommand {\n        outline&#58;none;\n        border&#58;none;\n        font-size&#58;16px;\n        margin&#58;0;\n        padding&#58;0;\n      }\n    &lt;/style&gt;\n  &#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/css&gt;\n  &lt;difficulty&gt;easy&lt;/difficulty&gt;\n  &lt;cruelty&gt;easy&lt;/cruelty&gt;\n  &lt;pov type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;player&lt;/pov&gt;\n  &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n    character_creation_function\n  &lt;/start&gt;\n&lt;/game&gt;[/code:q39uu029]\n\nlast, is Jay's Function:\n\n[code:q39uu029]&lt;function name=&quot;InitUserInterface&quot;&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;\n  JS&#46;eval(&quot;$('#txtCommandDiv')&#46;prepend('&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;')&quot;);\n  request(SetInterfaceString, &quot;TypeHereLabel=&quot;)\n  OutputTextNoBr(game&#46;css)\n&#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/function&gt;[/code:q39uu029]\n\nwhich can be placed anywhere (definately) after the 'game' tag block:\n\n(remember that the indenting matters: line up its indenting with the 'game' tag block, and the other Element tag blocks too: 'verb', 'command', 'object', 'function', and etc. They should ALL be at the same indenting!)\n\n[code:q39uu029]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;
