They can be collected in any order, so I can't attach an 'if' to the last item, as I don't know which one the last one will be.\r\n\r\nI assume I could add an 'if' to each of the 10 items, to check if the remaining 9 are in the inventory, but that seems a bit long winded. Is there a cleaner way to do this?",
