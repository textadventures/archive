      "EditableText": "Well, there are multiple ways to do this (EDIT: see my next post first maybe?).\r\n\r\nI would use an integer attribute because I know how to use them.  There is probably a way to use the if (Got(object one)) with the AND code bit, but I don't know how to do it!  WARNING:  this might be the most difficult way, but it does work as I just tested it out.  Also, if you are not familiar with using and changing attributes, they are INCREDIBLY handy.\r\n\r\nAnyway... \r\n1.  I created an \"object\" called carryinv and added an integer attribute to it with the name of **carrying** and set the integer to 0 (zero).  I placed the \"carryinv\" object in a warehouse/storage room.  I just needed an object to place my attributes on.\r\n2.  I have three objects that I eloquently called 'one', 'two', and 'three'.\r\n3a.  On the inventory tab of each object I chose the 'set variable' script and typed the following in the first box:  carryinv.carrying\r\n3b.  I left the drop down as expression and typed the following in the second box:  carryinv.carrying + 1\r\n4.  Don't forget to add a script to add the object to your inventory and a message indicating the object has been taken.\r\n5.  I copy-pasted this same code for objects two and three and just changed the add to inventory to the appropriate object.\r\n6.  I repeated this for the drop script except I changed the + to a - and moved the appropriate object to current room.\r\n7.  I have an NPC in my last room and added a speak to verb on them.  In the speak to verb box I choose an 'If' script.  I chose If 'object attribute equals' and typed in the object box **carryinv** and in the attribute box **carrying** equals **3**\r\n8.  Then... printed message saying \"Congrats, you are carrying all three\".  In the Else part of this script I printed a message saying \"You need to be carrying all the objects.\"\r\n\r\nBelow is the entire code if you want to copy-paste it in a new game and look at it in the GUI.
