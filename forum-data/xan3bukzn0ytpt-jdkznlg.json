Selecting one topic may make new topics appear in the list next time. For example, when talking to her about your brother, she mentions he is now at college, and next time you TALK TO MOM there is a new topic about him going to college.\r\n\r\nFirst, for the Mom object, go to the \"Conversation\" tab, and set her to be a \"Character\".\r\n\r\nEach conversation topic is set up as an object that is contained inside the character, in this case inside Mom. So create a new object, give it a suitable name, and make sure its parent is set to Mom. Give it an alias; this is the text that appears in the list of topics available.\r\n\r\nThen go to the \"Conversation\" tab.  If this is a topic that will be available from the start, set it to be \"Starting Conversation Topic\", otherwise a \"Conversation Topic\".  In the \"Conversation\" text area, type all the stuff you want to appear on screen when the player picks this conversation.\r\n\r\nDoes this conversation bring up new topics? If so, add their names to the list at the top. If this is the topic about your brother, you can put in the name of the topic about him at college here.",
