I, as well as all people who played the game so far, are all reporting they would experience timeouts several times while playing. And this isn't because I or they are doing longer breaks while playing, it often happens in the second you finished and sent a command, more or less instantly. I read somewhere it would help using https:// instead of http:// and I first thought it's more stable now, but there are so many people reporting back it wouldn't still work, that my last hope is to find a solution in this forum. Otherwise, it's worthless asking the people to play the game. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.",
