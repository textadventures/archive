      "EditableText": "Hello everyone\r\n\r\nI am a doctoral researcher with the University of Southampton, UK and I am on the lookout for Interactive Fiction or other digital Interactive Storytelling authors to have a 30 minute interview with me on their experience with digital interactive (or IF) authoring tools. Let it be hypertext based, parser based, choise-based, or whatever exists out there, I am eager to listen from a variety of personal reflections on your experience with trying to use one of the tools and write a piece of digital interactive work.\r\n\r\nYour input will be significant for a study looking to identify issues around the use of the tools and determine whether there is an underlying authoring process that if brought forward can help authors understand the tools better and use them to write exactly what it is they want to write, as well as inform designers on what they should keep in mind when developing the tools.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it a lot from those authors who are willing to share their experiences by having a short chat with me. If you are interested please email me at sk1n15@soton.ac.uk or s.kitromili@soton.ac.uk where I can tell you more about the study and how you can take part.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance\r\n\r\nSofia Kitromili\r\n\r\nP.S The study will be looking to conduct interviews until May 2020 so feel free to contact me anytime until then.",
