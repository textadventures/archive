      "EditableText": "I used to think idle games are dumb, but just realised they’re not just dumb, but way too adictive as well. At this point, I play Adventure Capitalist for like 5+ hours daily. Not because it's fun to play anymore, but because I don’t want all my progress to go into vain (maybe I’m lil greedy). It has started to affect my eyes and overall health now.\r\n\r\nHow do you guys cope up with such game addictions? Also, particularly in my case, can somebody give me some tips or something?\r\n",

Sometimes it felt like a waste of time, so I talked to a friend and she just suggested me an auto clicker. I just run it for a few hours now, come back to the game and just buy upgrades, onset- it felt like it wouldn't be as fun but now progress is giving me the same rush, especially when i compete with my buddies over it . Still this addiction is too bad, and I am already losing my work productivity into idle games.",
