More formats are also supported.\n\n\nI won't make more comparison, I think I like both system all in all.\n\nInform seems more \"powerfull\" because it's closer to a language such a C, and it's also possible to really program with it, for ex I wanted to solve a problem I had, it's for finding how many soldiers they are in an army, when we know that they must be in equal rows, and some others soldiers are arriving late and they must be added to the rows, and those must remain equal etc.\nI solved it easily with this in Inform :\n\n[code:18z0fmqr]&#91; CalculerSub x ; \nfor &#40;x=1&#58; x&lt;=50000&#58; x++&#41;\nif &#40;x%3==0 &amp;&amp; &#40;x+1&#41;%5==0 &amp;&amp; &#40;x+2&#41;%7==0 &amp;&amp; &#40;x+3&#41;%9==0 &amp;&amp; &#40;x+4&#41;%11==0&#41;\n&#123;print x ; print &quot; ^&quot;;&#125;;\n&#93;;[/code:18z0fmqr]\n\n\nIt's not a hard critic, as I said before I think most critics against Quest from some users of rec.arts.in-fiction are not fair at all. I just think they believe the language in itself it's not as powerfull as it is in reality, and they also don't like it's not open source as other languages (and then easily portable). \nSo far the thing I dislike the most in Quest, when I'm designing my game, is to think it's limited to MSWindows. I hope to change O/S in the future, and I prefer to have a 'portable' game. And it's not the supposed limitations because I can design it almost as I wish, except I can't configure the colours of display in the sources and I can't include images in the text windows. \n\nYou could read if you want an overview of some of Inform's possibilities and way of programming, to read this guide :\n\nInform Beginner's Guide\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.firthworks.com/roger/IBG.html\">http://www.firthworks.com/roger/IBG.html</a><!-- m -->\n\nand study also the game tell.inf\n\nI don't want to preach against Quest of course, but it could give some ideas for improving Quest. I wrote about this before, but I think if it was multi plateform and with some more built-in verbs by default, other if coders may consider Quest with better eyes. Thanks to the wonderful library made by MaDbRiT the system is much improved, but if only 50% of people coding new libraries for Inform would help on Quest too, it'd increase much its popularity and quality. But remember, most good IF coders are on Linux...\n\nTwo last remarks :\n\n- I tried to look at the code of Cloak of Darkness for Quest at <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.firthworks.com/roger/cloak/index.html\">http://www.firthworks.com/roger/cloak/index.html</a><!-- m --> Unfortunately it's now obsolete and can't be edited in the QDK. I don't find the courage or the hability to recode it myself.\n\n- an interesting option in QDK would be to display in the boxe the normal ASL code of the game, instead of a simplified one, so one could get inspiration to code by hand more easily (instead of having to create a temp file from QDK, open it in text editor, copy the code to the ASL source etc.)",

I wrote about this before, but I think if it was multi plateform and with some more built-in verbs by default, other if coders may consider Quest with better eyes. Thanks to the wonderful library made by MaDbRiT the system is much improved, but if only 50% of people coding new libraries for Inform would help on Quest too, it'd increase much its popularity and quality. But remember, most good IF coders are on Linux...<br/><br/>Two last remarks :<br/><br/>- I tried to look at the code of Cloak of Darkness for Quest at <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.firthworks.com/roger/cloak/index.html\">http://www.firthworks.com/roger/cloak/index.html</a><!-- m --> Unfortunately it's now obsolete and can't be edited in the QDK. I don't find the courage or the hability to recode it myself.<br/><br/>- an interesting option in QDK would be to display in the boxe the normal ASL code of the game, instead of a simplified one, so one could get inspiration to code by hand more easily (instead of having to create a temp file from QDK, open it in text editor, copy the code to the ASL source etc.)",
