I use this site as a teacher to make escape rooms for my students and sometimes I find errors that need to be fixed ASAP.  I cant just save/edit my (SQUIFFY) games as it takes a few hours before the update is \"live\". So I end up making a new version and then publish the new version.  There are some games where I have 5-6 versions of the same games from updates throughout the day.  If I could unpublish my games I could delete them, or update them and the republish would push the update live quicker I would assume.\r\n\r\nI wish I could \"clean up\" my work space. Since I cant, if an admin could clean up my space by deleting my \"DELETE ME\" files that would be awesome.\r\n\r\n",
