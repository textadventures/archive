      "EditableText": "Are these sections, or passages?\r\nIf they're sections, you can just have the timeout function check which section the player is in, and do nothing if they've already gone somewhere else.\r\n\r\nIf you're using passages, I don't think there's an easy way to check (as the `_section` attribute only gives the name of the current section).\r\nTo clear a timeout, you need to get the return value of the setTimeout function, which is an ID number. You can pass this number to `clearTimeout` to cancel the timeout.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n[A]:\r\n    var timer = window.setTimeout(function() { squiffy.story.passage('B'); }, 5000);\r\n    squiffy.set(\"timerID\", timer);\r\n\r\nDo you want to go to [C]?\r\nTimeout with ID {timerID} is running!\r\n\r\n[B]:\r\nFive seconds and you didn't go to [C] yet?\r\n\r\n[C]:\r\n    window.clearTimeout(squiffy.get(\"timerID\"));\r\n\r\nHi!
