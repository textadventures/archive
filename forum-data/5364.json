(I have never done this myself, so I don't know all the details, but you will need to move the objects around when you switch, as you'll want the monstrous character to be in the same room the other one was, the other one to not be there, etc. That might play havoc with the room enter scripts, so keep that in mind.)\n\nAs far as the behaviors you described, not having access to inventory can be as simple as removing the objects (if you switch POV, that will happen for you automatically).
