      "EditableText": "Hi there.\nFirst time user of Quest here, but I've always been a fan of text adventures (grew up on Zork and such). I've also created some of my own ones in Pascal, though it was a pretty messy affair.\nI've done the tutorials with great success, and have now started on a little project. The problem I'm having is that I want to create a computer with icons on the desktop. Each of these icons will launch a &quot;program&quot;, which is basically just a text message and a modifier to the player's stats. I have a room, with the computer on a desk, and the icons as objects. If I inspect the computer (after turning it on), I can see the icons. The problem is then I can also see the icons as part of the room, which it shouldn't be.\nWhat's the best way of handling something like this? Should I create the computer as a &quot;room&quot; with it's own interactive objects? Should I stick to using the computer as a container but change some attribute that makes the icons invisible unless I'm somehow &quot;sitting&quot; or something?\nThanks in advance. I hope to be active in putting my game creation ideas to work with what has so far been an amazing tool.",
