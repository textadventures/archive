In other words, I am in the &quot;dark&quot; room, and then can't get out because all the exits are non-functional :-S\n\nI checked the same room after doing nothing but unchecking the &quot;room is initially dark&quot; checkbox, and the exits appeared, so they're definitely working if it's not dark.\n\nIs it normal that when it is &quot;dark&quot;, you can't see any of the exits?  Is there a way to change this?\n\npsymann",
