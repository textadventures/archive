Once the editor is developed and ready to use, Quest 6 will be just as easy to use with no coding experience as Quest 5.\r\n\r\n---\r\n>  If I understand correctly, if I create a game with Quest, the only place to host it is on this site. Is that right? \r\n\r\nSort of.\r\n\r\nFirst, allow me to correct my earlier statement.  You asked if a Quest game can be \"uploaded\" to itch.io. I said \"no\", but I *should* have said, \"the only way to play a Quest game online is via this site.\"\r\n\r\nI think you can probably upload a Quest game to itch.io (I think), but the player would need to download your file and run it in Quest desktop software installed on Windows.\r\n\r\nQuest uses a lot of Windows-specific stuff under the hood, you see. So, it's either run Quest on Windows, or use this site (which runs a version of Quest which has been tailored to run on a Windows server). \r\n\r\nSquiffy games can be played in any browser, though, by the way. And Quest 6 games will be the same.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> Is there a way to ask for a donation on this site once I post my game?\r\n\r\nErr... Not of which I am aware.\r\n\r\nI've seen people put links to Patreon inside of their game, but we can't even add links to click the game description on the main page; so, I'm thinking you're asking if there is something already set up, and I don't think so.\r\n\r\nIf I am mistaken, fret not, for someone will come along and set the record straight if I am misinforming you. :)\r\n\r\n---\r\nBUT, even though itch.io can't run a Quest game, I would think you could:\r\n\r\n- Create a Quest game\r\n- Publish the Quest game on this site (as \"Unlisted\", if you wish)\r\n- Make a very basic HTML file which redirects to your unlisted Quest game's url\r\n- Publish the HTML file on itch.io\r\n\r\nThat way, all your traffic would be routed through itch.io (where I assume they have a way to ask for a donation), but they would still be playing the game from this server.\r\n\r\n**BUT** I highly advise against taking any money for a game which is intended to be played via this site's Quest server. Playing Quest game's online is possible, but the server tends to get overloaded on occasion. Most of us just publish games for people to play for free, not even accepting donations, and we still advise the player to install Quest in Windows and download the game to play. Even when the server is up and running, the games don't run nearly as well online. If you make a very basic game (with little to no added scripts), it will probably be fine as long as the server is up and running, though.\r\n\r\nThis will all be remedied in Quest 6. It will run on anything that will run Javascript, which is pretty much everything.",
