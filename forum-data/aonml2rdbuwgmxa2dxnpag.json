      "EditableText": "Hey folks!\r\n\r\nBeen thinking about my earlier experiments in game design, and I was wondering if anyone would be interested to see this one. I originally designed it as a turn-based strategy game, with plot segments (cut scenes) in between each stage. But now I'm wondering if the battles could be cut down to a kind of rock-paper-scissors game, a minimal system, and have the interesting bit be the plot.\r\n\r\nThe structure of this game would be based around a closed group of 36 characters, moving around a 'board' of 60 locations. Each character has their own 'progress tree'. For example, Kira's 'romance' tree has these states on it:\r\n\r\n* Has a crush on Baise; too nervous to admit it\r\n  * Given up\r\n  * Friends psyche him up to ask Baise out\r\n    * Dating Baise\r\n\r\nHe will also have a separate tree for his state with respect to a grudge against another character, and a debt of honour. He can move through the three 'stories' separately. They might also have some stats ranking from happy to sad; active to passive; and so on.\r\n\r\nAfter every 'battle', every character moves to an adjacent space on the map, and any who meet each other have a conversation or a battle. There's a set of conversations to choose from. A conversation that's like \"Kira and Archon\" takes priority over a generic one like \"Kira and a member of the Dragon Clan\" or \"Kira and someone who is depressed\". And a conversation that depends on a character being in a particular part of their tree will take priority over anything else those character could say to each other. Some conversations will change the people's social stats; and some move one character or the other onto a different part of one of their trees.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that some conversations, the player only sees if they're present. Some are more important, and you get the cut scene even if you're not there. And the ones that involve the playable character(s) may have choices of what to say for different results. But all of your friends/enemies can have the choice of a good or bad ending on their own personal stories. A game like this, there should be a lot of replayability because it plays out differently each time, so there's always a chance of coming across a storyline you've not seen before.\r\n\r\nDo you think that would be an interesting way to run the background for an RPG type game? The stuff that doesn't interfere with the \"main\" plot would be different each time, because of randomly moving characters. And yes, I know how much dialogue would need to be scripted for something like that.",
