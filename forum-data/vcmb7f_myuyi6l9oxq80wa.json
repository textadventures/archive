For example, when my character climbs up a ladder, the text reads:\r\n\r\nYou are at the top of a ladder.\r\nYou can see a minute hand.\r\nYou can go down.\r\nThe tops of the bookcases are layered with dust. It's a bit drafty up here.\r\n\r\nThat sounds jumbled to me. I would like the description of the room to come first, then the objects in the room, then the direction the character is able to go. Is there a way to change the order this information appears to the  player?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
