Tags include monster girls, vore, soft digestion, and other things, especially now that there are two novelized roleplaying logs to read. You can see the listing below. Me and my RP partners hammered these out fairly recently, and got the idea to turn the logs into a novelized format so others could read them. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/nwekh03ihewzhjdcptuloa/setokaivas-collection-of-novelized-roleplaying-logs\r\n\r\nEDIT: (07/09/17) My submission now includes two full stories to read through, rather than just the spider girl on magical girl vore story! There is now another story involving a near-demigoddess alraune meeting a young, egotistical and reckless dragoness. That one is complete and up for reading within the same submission; just click from the \"main menu\" which one you'd like to read. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nEDIT: (08/04/17) There are now 3 full-length stories available to read. The third is a Demoness on Foxgirl story, with a seductive temptress being happened upon by a young, naive vixen who is about to get her first 'taste'. Note that the foxgirl character is borderline lolicon. But of course all tags are available on my submission post. Enjoy!",
