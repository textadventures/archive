      "EditableText": "Hi.  I'm making my first IF game for a class, and I have some questions...\n\nIs there any way I can define alternate names for a room?  The room is named \"207 Parkhurst Hall\" but I'd like to allow people to write \"go to parkhurst\" or \"go to office\" and have it work.\n\nAlso, can I have a \"hidden\" room?  I have a puzzle where if you understand it right, you should write \"go to mailbox\" but I don't want \"mailbox\" showing up as a \"go-to\" place on the right side of the screen.\n\nThanks for any help.",
