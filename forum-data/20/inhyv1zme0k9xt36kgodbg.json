The only purpose of that is so I can hide that chunk of code so I can work undisturbed on other parts of the same code.\r\nExample:\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1070011252912439347/1070021795844993095/image.png\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that whenever I put in a new block into my code or change something it automatically expands everything. Is there a way to force it to stay closed until I manually open it?
