Or at least that is how I am seeing things in my mind's eye. Have been trying to think about any other mobile UI issues. \n\nA desktop version is easier because we can just spread things out ... less need for tabs, we can go with windows or side by side panes (taken directly from the layout of the mobile tabs. Desktop development is a must for me due to Steam Greenlight ... but the mobile development can give me all the pieces and its the mobile where screen realestate is constrained. \n\nThe UI, in my mind, is a constraint. It limits engagement in a story.  There is no perfect UI except maybe conversation / oral /  human (debatabe point, the thought here is that stories were all originally 'told', also there is the richness of information to consider) ... but when I think about UI design I want it to be as minimal a constraint as possible on my story. This leads me to think that a good background score, sound effects, audio treatment are essential.  Text is not so much as punctuated by, but accompanies the visual pane.  This is supported by audio atmospherics.  Text itself flows in a certain way and here the hyperlink or verb-entry issue crops up ... so too does color of text, font and other typesetting.  \n\nSorry for the stream of thought posting ... but it helps to hash this stuff out with people who know what I don't about the engine. Any comment or insight is always welcome.\n\nEDIT: So from the breif bits of reading about the conversion process, there can be issues. What sort of issues? Is there anything I can do during my dev arc to proof agianst problems? What makes the conversion smooth?",

At least two, so you could have persistent music in the background with action-based sound effects over top of it (a sword clash, a door slamming, maybe even voice work, etc). The more layers the better basically, but I can't really see really needing more than a few for anything I have in mind, and just having two instead of one would make a major difference for me. It doesn't seem to me like too big of a jump from what there is now, but I don't have any idea what I'm talking about, heh.\n\nBeing able to fade in and out and crossfade would be really nice, too. You can obviously already make the audio file itself have a fade, but then you can't loop it. You can kind of get it to work by having two files, the same except one has a fade and one doesn't, then playing the one with the fade first, holding the game up until it's done, then playing the loopable one and looping it, but then the player has to wait for the whole first file to play. Though this could be helped by just having a &quot;play one time, then&quot; sort of a deal that you could put scripts into.\n\nWhat would be super cool would be something sort of like the idea of scenery is with objects, where you could start multiple sounds at once and toggle whether or not you could hear them. Then you could build musical arrangements dynamically as things happen, like having battle music where a dramatic melody cuts through when you land a critical hit, or dropping to just percussion when you get low on health, and everything would stay synced up and in time with everything else. Something like that might be too demanding in terms of processing, though, even with compressed audio.\n\nSorry if that was too much all at once, I've had these things on my mind for a while.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",
