It's not so much a lack of inspiration in the 'unmotivated' sense, but more a lack of ideas for the last couple of episodes.\n\nYou see the player must work through the lower ranks of a drug's organisation to get to the main boss, with each baddie or contact 'unlocking' the next-in-line. So far this has been done with the player gaining the information in various way (conversations, theft, hacking, force) and I feel the pattern is getting a little repetitive (go to baddie, get information. Go to next baddie, get information. Go to next baddie... etc etc). The baddie I'm working on now is the penultimate and it would just be nice if I could do something different with this one.\n\nAny ideas as to how I might gain information about the 'Big Boss' in an interesting and original way?",

Again, without knowing anything about your game I can't give any more specific help than that, but if you can get them the information after, but not because of, fighting the penultimate bad guy -- preferably in a way that makes the player feel smart for having figured it out for themselves -- it'll add the twist I think you're looking for.\n\nDoes the info from the earlier bosses have any common thread between them?
