But if you'd rather not, I can try to summarise some of the story.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Here be spoilers</summary>\r\nSome of the scientists in the original space race didn't like having to work against the people from another country; they thought that if all of humanity worked together, we'd advance faster. After man had walked on the moon, and governments were slowly cutting back on their space spending, a bunch of these guys (from both sides) got together, pooled their resources, found some wealthy like-minded individuals, and went to establish a semi-permanent base on the Moon. Years later, they used it as a staging post to put the first colony on Mars. And then years after _that_, they removed their Mars colony and set off for Europa.\r\n\r\nLater. Early 21st century. Another group of scientists (led by the lunatic Emmanuel Wallace) decided to organise a 'secret' mission to Mars. They saw themselves as refugees, fleeing anti-intellectual persecution in politics at the time. They never knew they were the second group until they got to the Moon and found an existing staging post. They removed any trace of both their base and the predecessors when they left, hoping to make it harder for anyone to find them. Back on Earth, anyone who says Wallace actually went to Mars is treated the same as someone who thinks Elvis is still alive; they're crazy. On Mars, some of them found a 'treasure map' left by the predecessors, and decided to follow. Those who remained were in trouble because they only just had enough people and resources left to make their colony viable; so they decided that the existence of the predecessors was top secret. In fact, it's the _only_ big secret in their society.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2069. We've had the technology to go to Mars for decades, but as far as we know nobody has. Partly because of the cost, partly because the corporations who run Earth (there are still governments, but they're pretty ineffectual) couldn't see enough profit in it, and partly because it's hard to find people who are willing to go knowing that they won't be able to get back. The cost of carrying fuel there and back is prohibitive; so it's only possible if you accept that you're going to be staying there, in a pressurised 'camp' made by bolting five ships together on the surface. Five ships, 301 people, just enough to make a viable and self-sufficient camp until someone can follow them.\r\n\r\nThey're about a week into exploring the immediate area when they find evidence of the previous expedition; three underground cities, and three generations of Martians. A people whose culture and laws are based on a group of super-genius political scientists and game theorists trying to make a 'perfect' socialist society. Things are going to be tense. The bosses back on Earth even say there might be war; but with an hour delay in communications, and after three years in space, the people of Camp Wayland will take their own Commander's opinion over that of the sponsors back home.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nSomehow, I've also ended up spending an hour working out Martian Rules Football, even though it's only mentioned once in the book :p",
