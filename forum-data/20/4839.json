I know that if I was given the description of a location and told a beach (or whatever) laid in the distance, I would type 'go beach'. If I then got a logical response such as the one suggested in his post, I would be far more impressed with the game than if I'd got the default, and quite frankly illogical answer, &quot;I don't understand that command.&quot; or &quot;I can't see that (beach).&quot;\n\nIn fact, this brings up something I've been considering making a thread about; that of whether anyone else goes out of their way to avoid having the game reply to your commands in the first-person, as though it were a machine or robot replying to you in person.\n\nI know it's ridiculous, given how much a person has to suspend belief when playing these games, but I find such responses a complete immersion killer.\n\nFor instance, when I create an object, I always use my own 'take' and 'drop' commands, even if I don't want that object to be dropped, so that if a player tries to drop it he gets something like &quot;You consider dropping the gun, but decide against it for now&quot; so that it seems as though keeping the gun has been a conscious decision on their behalf, rather than having a machine [i:1mmdlixj]tell[/i:1mmdlixj] them they [i:1mmdlixj]can't [/i:1mmdlixj] drop it. The function remains the same (I, the designer are stopping them from dropping the gun) but the decision not to has been theirs (albeit forced by me).",

      "HTML": "<blockquote><cite>Marzipan wrote:</cite>I know it's besides the point, but would a player realistically type either one of those things?</blockquote><br/>Maybe not those exact words, but I think AlDaBeast's point is that if you give a player an exit from a room - even a non-directional one - they will try to go there. I know that if I was given the description of a location and told a beach (or whatever) laid in the distance, I would type 'go beach'. If I then got a logical response such as the one suggested in his post, I would be far more impressed with the game than if I'd got the default, and quite frankly illogical answer, &quot;I don't understand that command.&quot; or &quot;I can't see that (beach).&quot;<br/><br/>In fact, this brings up something I've been considering making a thread about; that of whether anyone else goes out of their way to avoid having the game reply to your commands in the first-person, as though it were a machine or robot replying to you in person.<br/><br/>I know it's ridiculous, given how much a person has to suspend belief when playing these games, but I find such responses a complete immersion killer.<br/><br/>For instance, when I create an object, I always use my own 'take' and 'drop' commands, even if I don't want that object to be dropped, so that if a player tries to drop it he gets something like &quot;You consider dropping the gun, but decide against it for now&quot; so that it seems as though keeping the gun has been a conscious decision on their behalf, rather than having a machine <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">tell</span> them they <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">can't </span> drop it. The function remains the same (I, the designer are stopping them from dropping the gun) but the decision not to has been theirs (albeit forced by me).",
