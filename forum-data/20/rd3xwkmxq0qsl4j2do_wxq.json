There is the Fade in state, the dialogue state, and the Play state.\r\n\r\nInstead of this, I decided to have different rooms in the game. The player with any Pokemon left over would be their own group, by having the player carry a Pokemon bag. The opponent character with their left over Pokemon would be another group, by having the character contain the Pokemon. The two Pokemon battling would be in a Battle Room. The whole thing would be surrounded by a second Battle Room.\r\n\r\nI'll try to make a drawing of it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nI-------I\r\nI [0]   I\r\nI [00]  I\r\nI [0]   I\r\nI_______I\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I made a Football field...)",
