If any one could answer any of these I would be most grateful.  \n\n1. Do I have to activate somthing for the player to be able to save?\n\n2. If a player saves and then quits the game,  will they be able to reload the save?  Or is it only saved while their online?\n\n3. What is the command for reloading a saved game?\n\n\nThat's it! Im sorry if these are stupid questions, im just trying to make sure I dont make any massive mistakes. Thank you in advance.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
