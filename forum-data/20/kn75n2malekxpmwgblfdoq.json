That will be the main point of contact for the user and the main requirement of the game engine, anything else is gravy, it doesn't need fancy graphics just images and text. So there would be an explore button, a home button etc, perhaps over a fixed map.\r\n\r\nI was looking at Visual Studio but it seems perhaps overkill for what I need. Google isn't being my friend today looking for options. Googling: Menu driven game engine, or button driven game engine etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions.",
