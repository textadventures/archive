      "EditableText": "\"What transitions?\" The way the map/compass scrolls when you're moving.\r\n\r\nOne reason I went with the arrangement I did is to provide a mental spatial orientation. It wasn't meant to be compass points as much as directions but to still allow the player to get a sense of which way things are oriented. I've read about the game Blue Lacuna, which used destinations as you wish to, and it was reported by players that they had a hard time forming a mental map of the room topology, without having some sort of frame of reference besides \"you're now on the beach\" or forest or whatever. People seem to need to know which *way* they've gone, not just where they've ended up in order to lay things out mentally. So I've been very wary of using only names for moving around, as I would rather learn from that mistake. Orienting the ways to go as I did was meant to solve that.\r\n\r\nI like the look of what you have in the image. And the two step click to select and then activate is interesting as well. \r\n",
