      "EditableText": "Hello.\nI'm considering creating a new open source text adventure engine, called XAE (XML Adventure Engine, this name may change), that run games specified in an XML language of my own design. I want to do this since I think that everyone, even people without any programming experience, should be able to create a text adventure game, and I also think that it could be a really fun project. However, since I actually want people to use this engine, I have a few questions to the community, to hear what people are actually looking for in a text adventure engine.\n\nI'm thinking about dividing the game's specification into the specification of rooms. E.g. a room of a game could be specified as the following snippet of XML:\n\n&lt;room&gt;\n   &lt;descriptions&gt;\n      &lt;description state=&quot;0&quot;&gt;It is a very dark room. You can just see a switch beside you.&lt;/description&gt;\n      &lt;description state=&quot;1&quot;&gt;You can now see the features of the room. It has a sword in one corner, and a door to the north.&lt;/description&gt;\n   &lt;/descriptions&gt;\n   &lt;items&gt;\n      &lt;item pickupable=&quot;true&quot; description=&quot;A large, shiny sword&quot;&gt;Sword&lt;/item&gt;\n   &lt;/items&gt;\n   &lt;actions&gt;\n      &lt;action activateWord=&quot;push&quot; resultStage=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Switch&lt;/action&gt;\n   &lt;/actions&gt;\n   &lt;paths&gt;\n      &lt;path position=&quot;n&quot; description=&quot;An old looking wooden door.&quot;&gt;Door&lt;/path&gt;\n   &lt;/paths&gt;\n&lt;/room&gt;\nIn this room the player will be able to do the following kinds of actions:\n\nout&gt;It is a very dark room. You can just see a switch beside you.\nin&gt;push switch\nout&gt;You can now see the features of the room. It has a sword in one corner, and a door to the north.\nin&gt;take sword\nout&gt;You take the sword.\n\nand so on. I hope that from the above example it should be clear in what direction I want the engine to go in. I was just wondering, before I start seriously working on the project, if there are any features that you feel would be necessary, or just nice to have, in an engine designed to make text adventures, that you would like to see in XAE. Any miscellaneous comments about the concept are also very welcome, since I don't have that much experince with designing (or even that much playing) text adventure games, but I just find them fascinating.\n\nAnd one last thing: Would you prefer such an engine to be written in something like C++ to give it a more integrated feel with the system, or would you prefer the slightly less integrated and more cumbersome feel of a Java application, which would of course also mean that it will be able to run on almost any system, and not just the ones that I, or yourself, want to compile it for?\n\nI apologize for the long post, however I thought that I might as well ask all of my questions at once, and hopefully receive more meaningful responce. This is also my first post on this forum, so if this is not the place for this sort of question, I apologize.",

I'm a computer science student, nearly done with my bachelor and looking to starting my masters degree the coming summer, so the thing that interests me most about this project is definately the technical implementation, and therefore the parser is also one of the things that I'll probably be spending quite some time on. \n\nYou're right that the format looks rudimentary, but that was to make it easy for new users of both XML and XAE to use, so I was going for a somewhat simple format. Your comment about people not being comfortabel with XML is probably correct, and I am also considering creating a GUI interface for creating the games, however I think that I'll wait with that until I have a working engine. \n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by conditional text? If you mean changes in room descriptions etc. based on for instance actions performed by the user or items carried in the user's inventory, then I was planing to implement that as a state number associated with every room, so that a given room's state could be changed, and it's description altered based on that. About the actions associated with items, as I showed, perhaps a bit implicitly, in my short example, items can be marked with a pickupable attribute, which allows the user to pickup and carry things in their inventory. A nice addition to this system might be to also add weight attributes and simillar to the different items. Are there any actions that you were specifically thinking of?\n\nAbout your thought on platform availability, I'm definately planning on making this available on as many platforms as possible. I hadn't considered mobile platforms, since I personally hate typing for very long on the on screen keyboards most modern smartphones has, but this might certainly be something that I'll consider.\n\nI have considered contributing to existing projects, however that would keep me locked in to their software architecture and design, and one of the big goals for me for this project is definately to build a larger, complete program myself, and actually publish it, so people can use it. During my studies I've of course built a lot of small applications and programs, but for me this is mostly a chance to put what I've learnt into practical use, and hopefully make something people can benefit from. \n\nIf you have any more feedback, now that I've hopefully clarified my idea a bit, I'd be eager to hear it.",
