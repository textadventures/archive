If the info to be transferred is small enough (e.g. player stats) then you might be able to fit it into a single line.

Quest uses XML, correct?\n\nI have two possible work-a-rounds. \n\nFirst, I can make some games that appear to have character growth, but it is actually predetermined growth of characters, so Episode 2 would start with all the character traits of the end of game Episode 1 character.\n\nSecond, when we finish the game we are working on (not a quest game) I can have one of my programmer develop an exporter/importer program. \n\n\nHow large can you reasonably make the text games before they become unruly, or super slow to load?   \n\n\nThanks,\nRob Corra",
