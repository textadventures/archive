I would like to hear from everyone what makes an NPC not just acceptable or good but effective and likable.  I've been playing the XYZZY awards 'Best NPC' category games to get some sense of the idea, but I'm not sure that I can articulate what it is that makes outstanding parser game NPCs outstanding as I'm just too new to IF.\r\n\r\n(But it does seem that the best NPCs always seem to have some kind of unique implementation about them that makes them unique.)\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that I am currently building my first longer, more serious game (I've built some really silly duds under another username, but those are of no importance/don't matter) and it is going to feature a handful of NPCs who I hope will be the strongest part of the story. As such, I don't want them to feel placid or flat.\r\n\r\nI'd be glad to hear what anyone has to say.",
