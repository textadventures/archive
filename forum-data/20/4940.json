In any given situation, there's more to (possibly) do.  That said, you are almost guaranteed to run into &quot;guess the verb&quot; problems, or be let down when an action that seems obvious to you wasn't implemented by the author.\n\nWith a small one, you sidestep the problems of the above, but at the cost of that illusion of freedom.  You'll quickly discover their limitations and you'll know that those are the only things you can ever do.\n\nI honestly don't know what my own opinion on this is.  I love exploring in games, which makes me lean towards large options and more choices.  That said, unless the author lists all the possible verbs (which is rare, even when the list is small, and unheard of otherwise), I end up seeing lots and lots of default messages.  Is it worth being able to &quot;bite&quot; or &quot;wash&quot; or &quot;spin&quot; the three things in the game you can do that to, at the cost of the hundred+ objects you can't?\n\nJust wondering if anyone has any personal thoughts/opinions on this they'd be willing to share.  I think it can make us better authors to stay in the mindset of the player sometimes.",
