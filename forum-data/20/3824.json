I have run into numerous games on Quest (some even highly scored) where, in some cases, you must type a specific sequence of words, a sequence which might not be natural. It was natural to the author, but not to every player. This is a design issue. Hyperlinks (and associated verb menus in Quest) can help with that, since it constrains and identifies the choices. Of course, the author has to have actually implemented the verbs in the UI. I have run into many games on the Quest site that both list verbs that don't work and don't list verbs that are actually needed. (This is a different design issue.)\n\nHyperlinks can also ease the job of 2 (parsing and identifying)  - and therein lies the problem for me.\n\nI have played games that use hyperlinks and games that don't, and I have noticed a distinctive difference in the &quot;flavor&quot; of the game experience. First, clicking a link instead of typing, in and of itself, gives the game a different feel. Typing on a keyboard is very tactile, very left-brain. Clicking a link is more spatial, more right-brained. I don't know if the left/right brain distinction is accurate, but there is a definite difference in how I feel while doing it.\n\nBut second, having objects and exits called out as hyperlinks changes the kind of *mental* work I need to do in the game. I don't need to read the text as carefully – the key words are called out and highlighted for me. Some words matter and, well, the rest don't. It can make things easier for someone new to IF, but at what cost? The immersion changes or an change. The pace changes.\n\nChanging the dynamic of the game is not in and of itself a bad thing – depending on your point of view, on your design, on what you want your game to be. And things like hyperlinks are almost essential in mobile apps – that paradigm is different anyway, so it's not as surprising when it's a different experience.\n\nHaving said all that, I'm curious how others feel. Are the changes that hyperlinks cause in game play a good thing, a bad thing, something else? Which kind of game would you rather play?\n\nI'm contemplating having both modes (keywords highlighted or not), but I'm not sure which should be default. Perhaps I'll give the player a choice...\n\n(I'm not looking for flame wars here. I'm eliciting *opinions*.

My main concern is this: let's say you're looking at a room description, and the description is a block of text which is waxing poetic about what you can see, hear, smell, etc. In such a block of text, there are pieces that are important to game play and parts that are either not important at all (prosaic filler) or important to setting a mood, scene, feeling, etc - parts that add color to what is going on, but which don't figure in the main game needs. Normally, the player *must* read all of that text, not only reading it but scrutinizing it closely to try to pick out what is important to the next step in the game. Now, I'm sure there are players who will read all of that text regardless, simply because they love to read and can appreciate being immersed in the situation. But there will be others who are goal-oriented who couldn't care less about, say, how damp the room smells or how the sunlight glancing off the water looks like electric ripples dancing on the skin of the world.\n\nI'm just saying that with hyperlinks and keyword highlighting, we need to be careful not to either consciously or unconsciously cause this separation in the experience, where hyperlinks point to what's critical to gameplay whereas the rest is just filler and color and tends to get ignored by the player. As I said above, if you have your gameplay set up where you do need to read all of the text not just to pick out the objects but for more depth, then you've done what I was saying.

I can't explain it, but when I'm typing, the game just *feels* different. By having to take the words in, processing them, *figuring out what I need to type*, and then making the motions of actually typing the words out, I feel more engaged somehow. Now, the &quot;figuring out what to type&quot; part can be a frustration, and that needs to be eliminated.

My main concern is this: let's say you're looking at a room description, and the description is a block of text which is waxing poetic about what you can see, hear, smell, etc. In such a block of text, there are pieces that are important to game play and parts that are either not important at all (prosaic filler) or important to setting a mood, scene, feeling, etc - parts that add color to what is going on, but which don't figure in the main game needs. Normally, the player *must* read all of that text, not only reading it but scrutinizing it closely to try to pick out what is important to the next step in the game. Now, I'm sure there are players who will read all of that text regardless, simply because they love to read and can appreciate being immersed in the situation. But there will be others who are goal-oriented who couldn't care less about, say, how damp the room smells or how the sunlight glancing off the water looks like electric ripples dancing on the skin of the world.<br/><br/>I'm just saying that with hyperlinks and keyword highlighting, we need to be careful not to either consciously or unconsciously cause this separation in the experience, where hyperlinks point to what's critical to gameplay whereas the rest is just filler and color and tends to get ignored by the player. As I said above, if you have your gameplay set up where you do need to read all of the text not just to pick out the objects but for more depth, then you've done what I was saying.

      "EditableText": "Great discussion.  I'm coming a little late to the game, but would still like to share my thoughts.\n\nFirstly I should explain the reason I chose Quest for my development platform is because of the user interface, specifically the links.  On the other hand, I would prefer to play an adventure game in the old-style mode (without links) since it's more challenging and more immersive.  I should also add that I come from an author background so my perspective may be slightly different than others.\n\nI believe that we are seeing a resurgence in IF, and if it is truly going to hit the mass market a UI with links will be the critical factor.  Three reasons for this.  Most of the younger generation is going to want a point and click interface.  There's no way my kids  are going to type their way through a game, draw a map or take notes.  \n\nThe second reason is the platform most games will be played on: smart phones and tablets.  I just finished Zork 1-3 on my Kindle, which I last played on a Commodore 64, and by the end I was getting tired of typing on a tablet (a phone would be even worse).  In spite of the fact, the latest Kindle OS has a pretty slick auto-complete function.\n\nThe last factor is also a result of the platform.  People will play in short bursts and may be away from the game for a day or two.  Therefore the puzzles need to be a little less challenging, which the links provide without me having to vary the difficulty through the code.\n\nSo to me the links are critical, but I also want to address the largest market possible (plus my own personal bias), and some players will prefer the greater challenge of playing without links.  Other than the idiosyncrasies of Quest  in regards to verbs and commands (I'll talk about that in a minute), it's really not that hard to offer both.  The current game I'm working on offers a normal mode and a classic mode, which the player can select.\n\nIn classic mode it looks just like an Infocom game and in normal mode you get all the links, the sidebar and additional hints on some of the puzzles.\n\nThe major problem with this approach is that some commands/verbs work differently when used on the command line versus the links.  For example in the case of ask and tell I had to modify the command to get the same response between normal and classic.  This wasn't too big an issue (thanks to Jay's help), but the put command was a nightmare.  I finally gave up and stole the &quot;use&quot; functionality since I had no need for it.  Even in that case I had to write a function, heavily modify the put command, modify some templates and make a few other changes.  \n\nIn other cases like &quot;throw&quot; all you have to do is add the verb, and the command line works exactly the way you want it to.  \n\nSlightly off-topic, but I really think Quest should provide standardization between the command line and the links.  Not only for people like myself who want to offer two modes, but for all the players who may complete the game using a combination of links and command line.  Even if I wasn't doing two modes I would never put out a game where someone can click put orange in bowl and it works, but if they type in &quot;put orange in bowl&quot; it doesn't work (just my personal opinion).  Of course you could also just remove the text.\n\nBottom line, if you prefer one style or the other and it suits your game, go for it.  But if you want to reach the largest market I think you really need to offer both.\n\nI should also state that I think Quest is a great development platform and my comments about the command/verb issue is not a complaint, but rather a suggestion for future development.  From what I understand, the link type interface is relatively new, and I'm sure it's still evolving.",
