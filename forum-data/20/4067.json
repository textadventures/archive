I've posted some info below for those looking for specifics. Feel free to submit work that you already have on this site; we'd love to see it. \n\nInky Path: [url=http&#58;//inkypath&#46;wordpress&#46;com/:3l02fzjt]http://inkypath.wordpress.com/[/url:3l02fzjt]\nFacebook: [url=https&#58;//www&#46;facebook&#46;com/inkypath:3l02fzjt]https://www.facebook.com/inkypath[/url:3l02fzjt]\nTwitter: [url=https&#58;//twitter&#46;com/InkyPath:3l02fzjt]https://twitter.com/InkyPath[/url:3l02fzjt]\n\nThanks everyone! Please submit your work and share with friends! For questions, comments, etc. you can reply here or email the mag at inkypath[AT]gmail.com.\n\n--\n\n\n[b:3l02fzjt]What is Inky Path?[/b:3l02fzjt]\n\nInky Path is the first literary magazine that showcases interactive fiction and provides readers with the tools to create their own game. It is about fostering a community of thought and discussion around IF works, seeing pieces for more than their entertainment value, and providing greater exposure of IF to the literary world. \n\n[b:3l02fzjt]What are you looking for? [/b:3l02fzjt]\n\nWe are looking for talented IF writers like yourselves to submit your interactive fiction to the site. There can't be a literary magazine without submissions, so we welcome everyone to bring forth their best work!\n\nIt's fine if your work is published elsewhere. You can also submit excerpts or the beginnings of pieces if you want. We welcome pieces of all lengths, types, and flavors. Bring us your best hypertext historical fiction, or parser-based paranormal romance. Or get even more experimental and send in some multimedia medley that defies all convention or classification. Have fun with it. \n\nCheck out the [url=http&#58;//inkypath&#46;wordpress&#46;com/submissions:3l02fzjt]submission guidelines[/url:3l02fzjt] for more info on submitting. We are accepting year-round. \n\nNOTE: We are also currently looking for more readers and graphic designers to help staff the magazine. [url=http&#58;//inkypath&#46;wordpress&#46;com/apply-for-a-position/:3l02fzjt]Click here[/url:3l02fzjt] if you would like to know more about becoming part of the staff.\n\n[b:3l02fzjt]How can I help?[/b:3l02fzjt]\n\nSince this is a relatively new publication, please, spread the word! Even if you are not personally interested in submitting, pass on the info to someone you know would love to. Since this really is the first of its kind, I'm hoping that it will succeed--I think it's something that the IF community has needed for a long time. \n\nIf you want to help fund the project, we also accept [url=http&#58;//inkypath&#46;wordpress&#46;com/contact/:3l02fzjt]donations[/url:3l02fzjt] .",
