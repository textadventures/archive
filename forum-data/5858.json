I know it may seem like one of my recently unanswered questions in disguise, but that problem has come on enough now to hopefully warrant this.\n\nI want to create the old DOS style &gt; symbol, which will serve as a command marker, due to the fact that I hide my command box. Because of this, if a player inadvertently mouse clicks the screen, the flashing cursor will disappear, making if tricky to locate the command box again to get back the flashing cursor.\n\nNow, in the libraries there's a function/command/whatever called TypeHereLabel, where you can simply change the text to whatever you desire.\n\nBut there a number of issues with this.\n\n1. Simply changing the [b:2wyztzq3]Type here...[/b:2wyztzq3] to [b:2wyztzq3]&gt;[/b:2wyztzq3], results in [b:2wyztzq3]| &gt;[/b:2wyztzq3] instead of the desired [b:2wyztzq3]&gt; |[/b:2wyztzq3]\n\n2.
