Next, you &quot;push&quot; those changes back up to your fork on CodePlex, again using TortoiseHg.\n\nOnce you've done this, you can request that I transfer the changes you've made - [i:1tsodlqf]from:[/i:1tsodlqf] your copy of the Quest repository, [i:1tsodlqf]to:[/i:1tsodlqf] the main Quest repository. This is the Pull Request, and you do this on the CodePlex site.\n\nThere's nothing special about the Pull Request really. CodePlex lets me see all forks anyway, so any changes you've pushed to CodePlex are visible to me. The Pull Request is just a formal way of letting me know that you're ready with your changes, and you think it's time for me to transfer them into the main repository.\n\nHope that makes some kind of sense!",
