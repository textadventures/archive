flags, are 8 binary digits (1 byte) is known as an 'octet', and a URL is actually made up of 4 octects:</p>\n<p>1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 // short-quick/easy form: 255.255.255.255<br>\n0000 1111 . 0000 1111 . 0000 1111 . 0000 1111 // short-quick/easy form: 8.8.8.8<br>\n0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0000 // short-quick/easy form: 0.0.0.0</p>\n<hr>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet</p>\n<p>url IPs actually use the same octets (4 octets): try typing into the url: 8.8.8.8</p>\n<p>8.8.8.8 (NON-human-friendly binary name/address) = google.com (human-friendly string name/address)</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Public_DNS</p>\n<p>in a computers (PC: command prompt/line/box) (Apple: terminal box), you can type this, try both of them:</p>\n<p>nslookup 8.8.8.8</p>\n<p>nslookup // hit enter, and then in the line below, type in:<br>\ngoogle.com<br>\n// type in this to exit out of it: exit</p>\n<p>nslookup  // hit enter, and then in the line below, type in:<br>\nyoutube.com<br>\n// type in this to exit out of it: exit</p>\n<p>now type in this:<br>\nnslookup 98.139.180.149<br>\n// XXX.yahoo.com</p>\n<p>and, try typing in this IP into the url: 98.139.180.149, you'll go to 'youtube.com' site</p>\n<hr>\n<p>so, you can go back and forth between binary IP and human-friendly name string IP:</p>\n<p>nslookup X.X.X.X // binary IP name/address to domain name/address (human friendly name string)</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>nslookup // hit enter, and then in the line below, type:<br>\nXXX.XXX // site name + ext, for example: google.com<br>\n// domain name/address (human friendly name string) to binary IP name/address</p>\n<hr>\n<p>nslookup<br>\ntextadventures.co.uk<br>\n// 104.28.15.47</p>\n<p>// url: 104.28.15.47 ---&gt; the hosting site of quest (cloudflare) blocks direct IP access to the quest site, but-as otherwise, it'd take you to the quest site, just as if you typed into te url: textadventures.co.uk</p>\n<p>// err... maybe cloudflare is the hosting site for my old laptop apple computer that I'm using, lol ... that is blocking it... meh... whatever.</p>\n\n",
