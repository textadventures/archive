I have made a system where as you walk around, you lose nutrition and hydration, and if you eat food or drink water, you gain nutrition and hydration. The problem arises when i try to stop the values from exceeding 100. I have tried using the script [code:2bvzgjjw]if (player&#46;Nutrition &gt; player&#46;Max_Value) {\n  player&#46;Nutrition = player&#46;Nutrition = player&#46;Max_Value\n}[/code:2bvzgjjw] with player.Max_Value being 100 In multiple places including after eating food and as a turn script. Every time i try this, for whatever reason player.Nutrition becomes Boolean and is set to false. I apologize if this is just a stupid mistake but I have rewritten this over and over without success and I would like to sort this out.\n\nedit: new values are now being turned into Boolean. This time it was a string value",
