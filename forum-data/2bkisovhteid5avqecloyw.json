At different parts of the game (during fights for example) I'd like to make objects that you would usually be able to interact generate a different message (and keep you from using it) during this state. What's the best way of going out this? I've figured out how to close doors. (i just lock them during a particular state, and the make a trigger to unlock them after an action is done, though i wish I could make the doors have different outputs for every specific session). I am not sure how to do this with objects though, other than just making them invisible, which isn't really realistic (they are there you just shouldn't use them at the time). Any ideas?",
