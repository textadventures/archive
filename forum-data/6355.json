There's one more problem I need to address.\n\nIn my game I have a container object on the player object where all the &quot;worn&quot; clothing goes to be stored so that it doesn't clutter up the player's inventory. When removed, it returns to the player's inventory. The problem is, if that container is &quot;closed&quot; the player can wear several items of the same layer (like two shirts for example) or two pairs of pants. Is there a way for Quest to recognize that whether the &quot;worn&quot; object is opened or closed, it still can't allow the player to wear two of the same clothing layer?\n\nWhen it's opened it works btw! Only when it's closed does it not.\n\nUPDATE\nThis thread is solved. My modified Do Wear and Do Remove were interfering with the new Wearables Libraries over-rides!",
