It's clear that this user meant to give Lighthouse's game five stars, and now the game's true &quot;average rating&quot; is not represented. It would bother me greatly if something like this were to happen with my game.\n\nMy question is, in a special circumstance such as this one, is it technically possible to alter the review made by DerpyTheMoonBear (with said user's permission)?",
