For future reference, don't name anything in Quest by some common name used in Quest/Quest Code - game, open, closed, isopen, isclosed, object, save - etc.  I did that a lot early on with doors and containers and the built-in code got confused with my flag names.  Took me forever and a lot of frustration to figure that out!  Can't believe I missed that.  I looked at the counter name and didn't see it anywhere but it did not really cross my mind that it was interfering with the game.\r\n\r\nGlad you got it resolved!",
