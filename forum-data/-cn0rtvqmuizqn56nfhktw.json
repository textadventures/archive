I've played quest games in .qsp format before on the soft player, but am I just an idiot in assuming a .quest file is basically the same thing? I like to release my games on many different sites like itch.io and patreon.com, but Quest games don't really work unless i include an installer for Quest, and most folks aren't gonna trust a rando download from a stranger on the internet when it has nothing directly apparent to do with the game they've already downloaded. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Is it possible to convert a .quest file into .qsp format and if so, how?",
