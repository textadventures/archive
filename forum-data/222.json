Fair enough if it was a graphical image or music i would like credit.  If you look at it from my point of view, all games have to be alike in some aspect, which is why there are TYPES, like text-based muds (all the same), strategies, RPGs, mostly based upon the same concept.  But sure, go ahead with your project.",

But now i'm getting into doing a really complex MP game, i will need to learn ASL because sometimes i need to go into the file and edit the main code.  I use QDK simply because it makes life easier, but having knowledge in a programming language makes you feel proud when you can become part of a community and join in with the conversations, because you know what they are talking about.\n\nTIP: read through the help documentation.  for the first time in 3 years i actually read it (not all of it yet), and im quite amazed at how simple and easy it all is.  By the time i'm done reading this, i'll be able to make more complex game systems, so trust me, reading the help document will take atleast 3 days (couple of hours reading time maybe  lol), and by the time you're done you will probably be able to code by hand no problem.  I've learnt so much already by just reading 1/4 of the help doc.",
