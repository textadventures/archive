      "EditableText": "<b>Systems</b>\r\nI implemented the following systems to make some of my NPCs lie:\r\n1. Personality Trait System\r\n2. Memory System\r\n3. Conversation System\r\n\r\n<b>Trait System</b>\r\nWhen each NPC is generated they are randomly assigned personality traits. I suggest using weighted randomness for more control over which traits show up more often. One of the traits that a NPC can get is the Liar trait.\r\n\r\n<b>Memory System</b>\r\nEach NPC has a memory which is a dictionary that contains other dictionaries. For example, inside of NPC.memory there is a dictionary called aliases. The aliases dictionary contains all of the aliases of the other NPCs that they know the alias of.\r\n\r\n<b>Conversation System</b>\r\nAside from making the game world feel more alive, the main point of the conversation system is to share information, both correct and incorrect information. If NPC A asks NPC B, who has the Liar trait, what their name (alias) is, NPC B will randomly pick a name from a list of possible names to give to NPC A. If NPC B's actual name is in that list of names, there's a chance that it will be selected and NPC A will get their true name. Otherwise, the wrong name will be given. Regardless of whether or not NPC A receives the correct name, the name is saved in NPC A's memory. From now on, NPC A will use that name to refer to NPC B when talking to them and talking about them.\r\n\r\n<b>Example Scenario</b>\r\nLet's assume that NPC A is a gang member who is looking for someone who killed a fellow member and they ask NPC B if they happen to know who did it. NPC B doesn't know who did it but they randomly give NPC A the name of one of the people they have in their memory.  With that false information, NPC A leaves to find and exact revenge on the wrong person. If that wrong person is in a different gang, the situation has the possibility to spiral into a gang war, all because of NPC B's lie.",
