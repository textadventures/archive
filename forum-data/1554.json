This will eat up drive-space.  I found that this also occurs when there's incorrect coding.  You can open up your asl file in an editor like WordPad or NotePad, etc (text editor)... When you save your file, save it like (and include the quote marks)... &quot;gamename.asl&quot; to make sure it doesn't save as a text file.  You'll have to close out the current version of your Quest game in the QDK-editor and reopen it so you are running the version with the corrections.  Also, if you're using 3.53 version, you might find that changes are made by the Editor to take-drop codes you add in... this is being fixed I guess for the newest version, so asl-handcoding becomes imperative to reduce your headaches and create a good game.  Once you coorect any errors by hand, then the Editor will display the code as it should be.\n\nGood game making to you :}",

I have been receiving an error if I close the Quest window when I have a &quot;wait for player to press key&quot; command not satisfied by the player.  In fact, a player cannot even restart Quest under the &quot;Quest&quot; drop-down menu on the upper-bar of the game-window if that command is not satisfied.\n\nIs this and other errors corrected in 4.0?",
