For example, within a text input or menu section, you could include something like:\r\n```\r\nplayer.chosen_name = result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis sets the `chosen_name` attribute of the object named `player` to the value of the `result` variable. In any code later on, you can then use `player.chosen_name` like any other variable; or include `{player.chosen_name}` in a text string that is going to be printed (object's 'look' response, room description, the string passed to a print statement, etc).\r\n\r\n(variable names without a dot in last until the end of the script that uses them. With a dot in, they are attributes, and last as long as the object named before the dot exists)",
