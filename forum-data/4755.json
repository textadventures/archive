So in theory it would be possible to write code that goes through each object, finds a choice, goes to the next object, etcetera, running the scripts along the way, and stopping if it hits an error. That way you could automatically test the project. Then you could add that to the gamebook UI. I think it'd be a decent sized project in itself though.",
