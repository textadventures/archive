For example, I have a blog and would like to fit an Iframe of Quest on a static page without breaking my layout or resorting to scrollbars. Something ideal would be 880 wide, and 600-700 high. I am no programmer, and have no idea how to resize the interface at all, any input would be appreciated.",
