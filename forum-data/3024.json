(Probably ignore that one...)\n\nN, N, N “You can see “a” Statues”\n\n“You can see “an” doorway...”\n\nYou have the helmet, even wearing it, but it still tells you something shiny at the bottom of the pool when you relook at the room.\n\nAfter killing the snake and looking at the room again, it says it is still there and hissing and blocking your path.\n\n\nYou can see “a” Books and “a” Soldiers.\n\nTwo soldiers die, but one bullet shot is sounded.  (Not really a big deal, either you got lucky and shot both or the sound was just for experience and you did not want to sound it twice.)\n\nAfter killing both soldiers and relooking at room it says they are still there and you should still “sneak” by them, but they are dead...\n\n“You are in You are in more of the library.”  Same as before...\n\nYou can not wear the uniform, but you use it and the Tough Guard thinks you are a recruit...\n\n“excelent” is excellent\n\nThe Strange Guard which is Ms. Grin, after the Tough Guard arrives from the stone statue coming to life and killing everyone and the Tough Guard blows it up, she tells you to talk to the Tough Guard or be discovered.

It was very quick though and I kept trying to wear the uniform opposed to simply “using” it on the Tough Guard to no effect.  But the sound effects were a really nice touch and I love the ending music.  I am actually looking forward to the next game in the series if there is one.  I actually like the powers you receive at the end.  I gave the book, but now I wish I would have given the stew.  Will you start off the next game by being asked what you gave the statue to begin with and then having only those special powers and what ever weapons you find?  That way different rooms could be explored and different puzzles solved and or you wont be able to see everything since you will only have certain powers.  It will give it extra replay ability!\n\nPs... Don't blame Ms. Grin.  Classic!   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",
