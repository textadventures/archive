The first hurdle I have hit is as follows:\n\nI created a newspaper and have it sitting on a table.  The newspaper is part of the scenery,  so you can't see it until you look at the table.  You can take the newspaper,  and it is acknowledged when you do this by saying, &quot;You take the newspaper.&quot;.  Now this is the problem,  when you check your inventory the newspaper is not listed, but you can still drop the newspaper!\n\nHow do I get the newspaper to show that it is in the inventory?\n\nThanks for your help.",

The first will hide the newspaper when you enter or LOOK at the room, the second will list the contents of the table when you examine it.\n\nThis makes the table object a 'Parent'. Click and drag the newspaper object so it becomes a 'Child' for the 'Parent' table object.\n\nSo now, when you enter the room, you see a table only. EXAMINE TABLE and the newspaper is revealed.",
