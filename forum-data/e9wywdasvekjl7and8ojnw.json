      "EditableText": "So, how do we generate 10000 scenery objects with description?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nBroken Stone Archway\r\nForgotten Woods Shrine\r\nAncient Ruin Pillars\r\n\r\nSo, the scenery object will be a three word phrase,\r\nthe first word is called a prefix\r\nthe second word is called a descriptor\r\nthe third word is called a noun\r\n\r\nBy understanding the terms for these words, we will know how\r\nto ask the bot to generate our list of 20 items\r\n\r\nSo, we need 25 prefix x 20 descriptor x 20 noun = 10000 scenery objects\r\n\r\n1. Create a hiddenroom that players cant access,\r\nin it, create an object called \"randomsceneryobject\"\r\n2. Create a function named generatescenery\r\n3. At game object, switch to scripts tab and call function \"generatescenery\" at column \"script when entering a room:\"\r\n\r\nGo back to \"generatescenery\" function and type the following code\r\n```\r\nif (game.pov.parent.visited=false) {\r\n  CloneObjectAndMove (randomsceneryobject, game.pov.parent)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a room1 at south of room, and link them together,\r\nplaytest the game, you can see that both rooms have randomsceneryobject,\r\nbut the important thing is even if you visited the same room multiple times,\r\nthere is still only one randomscenery object\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nNow we will upgrade the generatescenery function and give them random names\r\n```\r\nif
