      "EditableText": "Another way to do it (and I have done this before in Quest) is to have an object for each race/class. These would not be objects visible to the player but would be used internally. For example, you'd have an object named &quot;Warrior&quot; with attributes &quot;strength&quot; equalling 30 and &quot;agility&quot; equalling 15. You'd do the same for all the other classes. When the player selects a class, you would assign a member variable of the player to that object (if you need it later - the name at least would be there if you wanted to display it).\n\nSince these would be objects, you could also have scripts on them, which would handle the various delegation of functions. That saves you from having to check types all over the place with those massive if/else/then statements, which you'd have to keep updating for each class you add - a massive pain if you need to add a class down the road. To add a new class/race, you just create the new object.\n\nFor example:\n\n[code:36gpijuz]\nplayer&#46;class = Warrior\nplayer&#46;strength = player&#46;class&#46;strength\nplayer&#46;agility = player&#46;class&#46;agility\nplayer&#46;levelUp = player&#46;class&#46;levelUp // &lt;- this is a script assignment\n[/code:36gpijuz]\n\nThen later, you could just call:\n\ndo(player, &quot;levelUp&quot;)\n\nto increase the player level.

The script would be different for different classes. You could have as many of these as you like.<br/><br/>In order to group the classes, you could put them under a master &quot;Classes&quot; object. Then when you need to present a menu, you could just call &quot;GetDirectChildren&quot; on &quot;Classes&quot; to get all the class objects to put in the menu. Adding a new class would be as easy as dropping a new object under Classes with the appropriate attributes and scripts.<br/><br/>I could write up a sample game later, if you're interested. (I'm at work right now.)</p></blockquote><br/><br/>This wouldn't be bad either --- except I'm not using classes in the game exactly. BUT ...depending on choices made by appearance can affect attributes that the player will eventually have or at least I hope to have, for example...<br/><br/>choosing a &quot;large&quot; weight character will raise defense and attack but lower health<br/>choosing a &quot;skinny&quot; weight character will raise agility but lower attack<br/>and then later on after the initial creation process, a bigger breast cup, or different race will lower agility.<br/><br/>Stuff like that. But if raising and lowering defense and whatnot is too difficult to tackle for the time being, I'm fine with just focusing on aesthetics in the character creation and POV for now.",

((Neko's are a pain in the ass to include but then again so are races that use &quot;scales.&quot; Ha.))</blockquote><br/><br/>for the text processor commands, you can have layers of text processor command (text processor commands within text process commands), but it does get a bit challenging with the syntaxing, of course, lol:<br/><br/>from this link ( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/text_processor.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... essor.html</a><!-- m --> ), here's an example of how to do the multiple layers (nesting):<br/><br/>You can use as many sections as you like within the same text, and even nest them:<br/><br/>msg (&quot;You can {command:go to shop:go into the shop}. {if player.coins&gt;10:You have {player.coins} coins, which is more than enough.}&quot;)<br/><br/>************<br/>or... you can just work with the Expressions themselves, but it's a bit more difficult to learn and messy, than in using text processor commands within your Expressions. if interested, I try to explain on how to do it here: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://ifanswers.com/945/quest-gamebook-how-to-use-and-or-and-not-inside-an-if-command\">http://ifanswers.com/945/quest-gamebook ... if-command</a><!-- m --><br/>***********<br/><br/>player.race = &quot;neko&quot;<br/>player.tail (set as a String Attribute) = &quot;neko&quot;<br/>(optional): player.has_tail (set as a Boolean Attribute) = true<br/><br/>player.race = &quot;human&quot;<br/>player.tail (set as a String Attribute) = null // or: &quot;none&quot; // or: &quot;no tail&quot;<br/>(optional): player.has_tail (set as a Boolean Attribute) = false<br/><br/>for the pov:<br/><br/>{if player.has_tail=true:You have a {player.tail} tail.} {if player.has_tail=false: You don't have a tail.}<br/>OR<br/>{if player.tail=&quot;no tail&quot;:You have {player.tail}.} {if not player.tail=&quot;no tail&quot;:You have a [player.tail} tail.}<br/>OR<br/>{if player.tail=&quot;none&quot;: You don't have a tail.} {if not player.tail=&quot;none&quot;: You have a {player.tail} tail.}<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>skin is the largest organ of the body, and it can be an amazing diversity of types: skin (normal soft skin which can be torn bloody by 'rope burn' or super hard~tough callous skin which can handle 'rope burn' without any damage, fur, feathers, and scales.

How do~are you going to raise, or lose, your stats during game play?). I presume that at least the detrimental health decrease is only initially for the character creation, lol.\n\nafter I know what you want to do, this stuff needs some fixing up, including your 'corruption' and 'health' scripts in your 'corruption_and health_script' Turnscript, and maybe a few other places too, where you use an incorrect syntax~logic of ~ 'if (xxx = 0 and xxx &gt; 100) { xxx = 0 }', which I need to know what you were intending to do, so I can fix it up so its correct and doing what you wanted.\n\n------\n\nalso, you really only need 1 global Turnscript, so you should move the scripts from one of your Turnscripts into the other Turnscript.

Same with your health, if health is 0 or less than 0, then game over. Yes, if this is the stuff you want, then you'll need the 'checking' scripts that do it.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Is there a way for 0 health not to be a game over ---- but to clear all enemies in the current room and run an event with randomized outcomes? And then give the player back 1 health?<br/><br/><blockquote><p>ya, I got to look into why the pov is doubling your stats, issue. Let me try to figure that out.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Yes! This is incredibly bizarre. When I first noticed it last night, I was like...wtf...were those numbers always that high? LOL  <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Update</span> it actually does it whenever the player does anything, like activating a verb too. Wonder what the issue is!",

But now that your 'maximum health' has been reduced, your 'health' which was at full health (your old maximum health), is now above your new reduced maximum health from becoming a &quot;dark elf&quot;, and thus we can't have your health be higher than your maximum health, so we reset your health to being the same as your new reduced maximum health. for example:<br/><br/>you as a normal elf at full health: 999/999 HP~Life~health<br/>your corruption gets raised to 50 or above, causing you to change into a 'dark elf' now: 999/500 HP~Life~Health<br/>but we can't have that, so we need to make it be: 500/500 HP~Life~health<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/><pre><code>if (player&#46;agility &gt; 100) {<br/>  player&#46;agility = 100<br/>}</code></pre><br/><br/>let's pretend that your max limit for your stats (strength, defense, agility, intelligence, corruption) is 100, so if any of these stats (such as agility) gets raised above 100, we need to reset that stat (such as agility) to being at our max limit of 100<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/><pre><code>if (player&#46;intelligence &lt; 0) {<br/>  player&#46;intelligence = 0<br/>}</code></pre><br/><br/>let's pretend that your min limit for your stats (strength, defense, agility, intelligence, corruption) is 0, so if any of these stats (such as intelligence) gets lowered below 0, we need to reset that stat (such as intelligence) to being at our min limit of 0.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>my use of saying 'checks~checking~verification~validation' is just basically 'if' Scripts to account for various scenarios~conditions, as this is often the case for most things you want to do.<br/><br/>for example:<br/><br/>inputting a password to get into your account on this site (or any site) or your computer, is a &quot;check~checking~validation~verification&quot; IF Script&#058;<br/><br/>(please never use &quot;123456&quot; as your password, lol. Unfortunately, this IS the most used password by people, despite that it is 0% protective~safe, lol.

It takes a long time to train your brain to think like this and to understand it: thinking like a computer is not natural, you got to train your brain to think in this 'code logic' and to be able to understand it too, which is NOT easy at all.

They'll know what I'm doing and be able to help you with it.\n\n--------\n\nif you need help on the transformation scripts themselves... you can use the 'race' and the 'tail' transformation scripts that you've already got as examples for doing any of the other transformation scripts that you want (add these scripts to the 'catnipseffect' Script Dictionary Attribute in your 'creation' Object, see how it looks in code: give the new key as the next number and then add your transformation scripts for it)\n\nif you need help or are confused, again any of the moderators can help you with this stuff.",

+ result + &quot;, and thus were given a &quot; + player&#46;fruit + &quot; to eat&#46;&quot;)<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/game&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>using the 'show menu' we select a color (red, blue, or yellow), and then the 'StringDictionaryItem' takes that selected color and looks for its matchup in the 'color_to_fruit' String Dictionary:<br/><br/>&quot;red&quot;=&quot;apple&quot;<br/>&quot;blue&quot;=&quot;blue berries&quot;<br/>&quot;yellow&quot;=&quot;banana&quot;<br/><br/>let's say we selected 'blue' as our color:<br/><br/>&quot;blue&quot; indeed is a match in the 'color_to_fruit' String Dictionary:<br/><br/>&quot;red&quot;=&quot;apple&quot;<br/>your choosen color 'blue' -----&gt; &quot;blue&quot;=&quot;blue berries&quot;<br/>&quot;yellow&quot;=&quot;banana&quot;<br/><br/>ah, okay, and now, what is the output~return for the item with the key of 'blue', it's value of 'blue berries' :<br/><br/>key = value<br/>&quot;blue&quot; = &quot;blue berries&quot;<br/><br/>and thus it returns &quot;blue berrries&quot;<br/><br/>player.fruit = &quot;blue berries&quot;<br/><br/>------------------<br/><br/>what's the difference amongst:<br/><br/>String Dictionaries<br/>Object Dictionaries<br/>Script Dictionaries<br/><br/>String Dictionaries: string1A=string1B; string2A=string2B; string3A=string3B; etc etc etc<br/>Object Dictionaries: string1=object1; string2=object2; string3=object3; etc etc etc<br/>Script Dictionaries: string1=script(s)1; string2=script(s)2; string3=script(s)3; etc etc etc<br/><br/>only in what they output~return: strings vs objects vs script(s)<br/><br/>also, for script dictionaries, since they return~output scripts, you're *NOT* assigning them to a VARIABLE, but instead 'invoking' or doing ('do') them:<br/><br/>Assignment Operations:<br/><br/>VARIABLE = StringDictionaryItem (Object_name.String_Dictionary_Attribute_name, Key_name)<br/>VARIABLE = &quot;Value_name&quot; // a string~text<br/><br/>VARIABLE = ObjectDictionaryItem (Object_name.Object_Dictionary_Attribute_name, Key_name)<br/>VARIABLE = Value_name // an actual Object<br/><br/>Action~Execution Operations:<br/><br/>using 'invoke' ( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/invoke.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... nvoke.html</a><!-- m --> ) :<br/><br/>invoke (ScriptDictionaryItem (Object_name.Script_Dictionary_Attribute_name, Key_name))<br/>invoke (the values, which is~are: Script~s)<br/><br/>or, using 'do' ( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/do.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/do.html</a><!-- m --> ) :<br/><br/>do (Object_name, Script_Dictionary_Attribute_name, Key_name)<br/>do (the values, which is~are: Script~s)<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/>now for my 'catnipeffects' Script Dictionary, we want what item selected, to be random:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;creation&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;attr name=&quot;catnipeffects&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;item key=&quot;1&quot;&gt;<br/>      // your race tranformation scripts<br/>    &lt;/item&gt;<br/>    &lt;item key=&quot;2&quot;&gt;<br/>      // your tail transformation scripts<br/>    &lt;/item&gt;<br/>    &lt;item key=&quot;3&quot;&gt;<br/>      // your whatever transformation scripts<br/>    &lt;/item&gt;<br/>      // etc etc etc items<br/>  &lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>we use the numbers for our keys, as this allows easy (via direct) use of:<br/><br/>GetRandomInt (1,max) ======= keys (1,2,3,...max)<br/><br/>via:<br/><br/>invoke (creation.catnipeffects, ToString (GetRandomInt (1, ListCount (creation.catnipeffects))))<br/><br/>or (maybe the 'ToString' isn't needed):<br/><br/>invoke (creation.catnipeffects, GetRandomInt (1, ListCount (creation.catnipeffects)))<br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>so, for example, let's say the 'GetRandomInt' selected '2'<br/><br/>does our selected '2' matchup with any of the keys in our 'catnipeffects' Script Dictioanry Attribute?<br/><br/>yes:<br/><br/>'2' ------&gt; &lt;item key=&quot;2&quot;&gt; value(s): tail tranformation script(s)<br/><br/>thus we execute~do~run~activate the '2' Key's value(s), which are: the 'tail transformation script(s)'<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>if '1' was choosen, then we execute~do~run~activate the 'race transformation script(s)'<br/><br/>if '3' was choosen, then we execute~do~run~activate the 'whatever transformation script(s)<br/><br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>so the 'GetRandomInt' is the first randomization that occurs (which transformation scripts do we do: the race transformation scripts, the tail transformation scripts, the whatever1 transformation scripts, the whaever2 transformation scripts, etc etc etc)<br/><br/>and then if you use the 'RandomChance' as the first script of each of the different transformation scripts (key=1:race tf scripts, key=2:tail tf scripts, key=3: whatever1 tf scripts, key=4:whatever2 tf scripts, etc etc etc), you got your second randomization that occurs:<br/><br/>wait... while the 'tail transformation scripts' are choosen to be run~executed~activated, NOT YET, we're going to first see if they actually get to run~activate~execute, via the 'RandomChance', and then if yes, then they're finally actually executed~activated~run, otherwise, nope, they're not, despite having been selected via the 'GetRandomInt'.<br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>if this still doesn't make sense, any of the moderators can probably explain it to you, better than me, lol. They'll know what I'm doing and be able to help you with it.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>if you need help on the transformation scripts themselves... you can use the 'race' and the 'tail' transformation scripts that you've already got as examples for doing any of the other transformation scripts that you want (add these scripts to the 'catnipseffect' Script Dictionary Attribute in your 'creation' Object, see how it looks in code: give the new key as the next number and then add your transformation scripts for it)<br/><br/>if you need help or are confused, again any of the moderators can help you with this stuff.",
