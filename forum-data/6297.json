      "EditableText": "hi, \ni am ready with my first quest game. But i want to hide the final solution for the game from the player. Simply a download from the &quot;play&quot;-site will give the player all infos if he look into the sourceaslx. Is there a &quot;encrypt&quot; function in the quest editor to hide messages in the source aslx file (and hide the key)? Or is it possible to encrypt the whole file before upload to textadventures.co.uk? I ve read in the forum that the version 4 has the ability to encrypt the asl file but i cant find it in the 5.6.2 editor. \nthanks",
