      "EditableText": "Does the Quest game maker for text adventures run slowly for others?  I know my laptop is not the best, but it has a lot of space and I do not remember it running so slow before when I had an even older and more sluggish laptop.  I do not have SSD, but it feels like it drags between each and every new room, object and presumably script I give it.\r\n\r\nI am not loading it to play test it, simply creating a room with nothing in it and it pauses.  Create an exit and it pauses.  Create an object and it pauses.  Rinse and repeat.  Is it suppose to take so long?  I timed it and it is between three to five seconds.  Is it only going to get worse, as I add more and more things to the game or is this about as long as it is going to take to create rooms and objects?  I am literally only on my third room with hardly anything in them in this particular game, for objects, scripts or otherwise.  Thank you.",
