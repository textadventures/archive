I just have a question that isn't exactly covered there.\n\nNow, what it looks like is that it assumes that every character is in the same room, hides the currently used character, and only allows for a certain task to be performed if an attribute is equal to what is required for that action, and that attribute depending on which character is &quot;selected&quot;. I notice that this doesn't change the POV. I also saw that it has mentioned a way of having those other characters follow the player, and a way of stopping the character switch if the other character is not visible. It also says that the player is not an object that can be switched to.\n\nNow here is my qualm.\n\nSeeing as how this doesn't change the POV, this means that the other characters are objects whose presence is what allows for certain actions to be achieved. However, what I require is a way of changing the POV so that I can swap between characters from across a game to solve certain puzzles. For example, Player 1 is out hunting, whereas Player 2 is back at the campsite, and I can swap between these characters and assume complete control. I figure that having two different inventories might not be possible without using a container system accessible via a particular command, but I don't know.\n\nI know that others have asked this, and I've searched back several pages of topics in search of someone who has the same question as I, hopefully solved. But I found nothing, so I'm asking this now.\n\nTL;DR Does the Wiki method of character swapping meet the requirements I have set forth? Or must I use an alternate method?\n\nEDIT: My apologies, but it appears I overlooked something. All of my problems are solved, and I apologize for posting this without having checked every other available resource.",
