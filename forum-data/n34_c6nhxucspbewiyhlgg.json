In my current game it will only apply to interior locations and I will notify the player beforehand in an intro paragraph, but if possible I would like it so that the player simply types **go [first letter of room name]** to move there. Of course if there's two locations accessible from any given point that begin with the same letter, then they would type the first two, or first three etc).\r\n\r\nCould this be done, and if so how? Would it work if I gave the rooms the relevant alias, so for instance **living room** would have the alias **li** while **landing** would have the alias **la**. I'll have a check to see if that works.",
