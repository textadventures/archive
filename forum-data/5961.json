In order to PM someone the player is moved into a new room and the main chat conversation, which is a turn script, won't disable.\n\nLogin:\n[code:v2owrr5h]msg (&quot;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Login Required&#46; Username&#58;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;)\nget input {\n  player&#46;alias = result\n  msg (&quot;{player&#46;alias}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Password&#58;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;)\n  get input {\n    player&#46;password = result\n    msg (&quot;{player&#46;password}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=green&gt;Login Successful&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)\n    EnableTurnScript (CHATROOM1)\n  }\n}[/code:v2owrr5h]\n\nThen, when you're moved into the PM room, this is the code before you enter the room:\n[code:v2owrr5h]DisableTurnScript (CHATROOM1)[/code:v2owrr5h]\n\nIt should be simple, right? I'm not sure where I'm going wrong here. I've moved the disable code all around and nothing is working. I also have it clear the screen and change the background when you move rooms, and that works fine. It's only the turn script that won't disable.\n\nThanks!",
