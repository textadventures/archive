Let's say I make an item πέτρα (stone). Get and Drop (πάρε and ρίξε) work fine, but other verbs, for example Throw (πέτα) give an error:\r\n\r\n> πέτα πέτρα\r\nError running script: Error compiling expression 'πέτρα': SyntaxError: Unexpected character: πLine: 1, Column: 1\r\n\r\nSeems you cannot have an object in a non Latin language?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the issue? Would it be easy to correct it?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nThanos",
