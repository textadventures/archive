      "EditableText": "Nice work, but is it really necessary to replace all the original core files? Q5.4 is alpha so there will be changes every week in core files. Then you (and every game author) must change your lib_core files again and again. I am changing only some core functions for my game, but with every release of Quest I have to adjust some of them again. If you don't do this, your game will break and can't be played.\nSo I think it would be better, if this features would be included into the core files. Please write an email to Alex and ask him if he likes to see this features in Quest. If so I could help you to insert them into the core files",
