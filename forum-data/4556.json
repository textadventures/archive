Some people like hard puzzles where you probably end up having to look at hints; other people don't like puzzles at all, or don't mind straightforward ones. I've read quite a bit on the intfiction forum, and the answer is... it depends. You'll never please everyone.\n\nSo I'd say: write the game that you'd want to play or for an audience you'd like to target (for example, for me, it's my non-IF-playing family), and then be sure to give it to people to test, as we're all too biased to judge our own games objectively (either good *or* bad. I'm often harder on my stuff than others are).\n\nAs for my preferences: I'm not a big puzzle person. I'm not good at writing them, and I don't particularly care to work them out, especially if it involves some sort of &quot;guess the verb&quot;, &quot;guess the noun&quot; or &quot;try to divine the bizarre thing the author intended.&quot; More specifically, I like a game with some sort of hook. In particular, I like games where you can do things and go places (which is why CYOA is so hard for me to get into), but more than that, I like a game that makes me feel something, preferably not frustration. But it doesn't have to have those as long as it has *something*, where that something could be anything, which I'd know when I saw it but I can't say definitively.

(I've also played lots of other kinds of games I don't need to get into.) The games I have enjoyed the most (non-IF) have been games like Zelda and Myst Uru Online.

The puzzles revolve more around what you do with the world, not in how you instruct the game. There is no typing, and yet I never missed it, as things just did what I expected or at least did something when I didn't know what would happen. I'd love to be able to do that with IF, where I can have puzzles and other challenges in my games that are more about what to do in the world as opposed to figuring out how to input it.

Take Jet Set Willy. You forever lose lives trying to work out how to complete the game. So you get the infinite life cheat only to discover that the character begins its turn on where it entered the screen so when you accidentally fall from one screen to another and die, the game proceeds to do this infinitely. So no help there either.\n\nBut that's what we had and we went with it. For graphic based games there was a reason behind it: available memory. Games had to be punishing otherwise there was no point in releasing a game that was satisfyingly easy but over in ten minutes. I'm not sure how IF fits into that given the smaller file sizes (although some did contain crudely drawn images) but that was certainly the culture of that time.\n\nFast forward to today and you can now purchase fully animated RPG blockbusters that cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to make (and millions in some cases) where available memory isn't an issue any more and the design has adapted accordingly from dying very easily to the things you describe: being able to explore. In the odd occasions that people do die in modern games, they generally start back from pretty much the same position again (not from the beginning like in the '80s) with a minor infraction such as loss of weapons/inventory (Grand Theft Auto - or do you lose money, I forget now) or a percentage of accrued monies (Borderlands). Some just transport you back to the last save point or any previous one if the last one isn't convenient (Skyrim). You certainly don't get bogged down with impossible puzzles. \n\nIF needs to catch up in this regard*. Being killed regularly in a game in the '80s is explainable. Being killed by a game in the '00s seldom happens; design shifted from punishment to minor infractions that don't really take anything away from the immersion. Difficulty can be selected. \n\nBy not following the new trends, especially from the position of the underdog, IF is commiting genre suicide, imvho.\n\n*I know not all IF does this, but some authors still adopt these old gaming clichÃ©s like we're still in the '80s to the detriment of the audience. Sudden inexplicable deaths (or even pointless explainable ones) and impossible puzzles aren't clever, they're bad game design imo.\n\nE2A: I find it interesting that you haven't played much IF (I haven't either, really) yet invest so much time into posting here and writing code.

Which doesnât happen very often.\n\nSaying that, I used to be a big fan of difficult games (back in the 80âs when I first started playing text adventures). Iâd sit for hours trying to figure out puzzles that these days Iâd just give up on. But back then I had a lot more free time on my hands and there was the added fact that if I was playing a game, Iâd likely spent money on it and if Iâd spent money on it, I wouldnât quit on the thing no matter how hard it was. I wanted my moneyâs worth! Now, with every text adventure I play being free, there's far less incentive to keep struggling with it if I get stuck â quitting costs me nothing. (Itâs also worth noting that in the internet age, any time I get stuck in a game, I can quickly hop on Google and find the solution to it, which cuts down a lot of my incentive to keep trying. Before I had access to the internet, if I wanted to finish a game, I had to do it on my own.)\n\nAs a writer, my opinions on how easy / difficult games should be have changed a lot over the years. I used to think it didnât matter how difficult you made a game because people would finish it sooner or later, but now I think itâs better to err on the easy side. I doubt many people quit text adventures because they're too easy, but I imagine lots quit because they're too hard (I know I do). At least if a game is easy, you're likely to continue playing to see what happens next, or if it becomes more difficult later on, but if itâs too difficult to begin with you're likely to simply quit.

You don't want it near the end either, as that initial energy and excitement about playing a game may be waning at that point, and it's easy to lose them there, too.

      "EditableText": "Speaking of puzzles being too hard in a game, if I can not figure out how to do something in the first few minutes or half hour of starting the game where I can not proceed any further and I am pretty sure I know the solution to the puzzle, but I am fighting the interface and have even typed &quot;help&quot;, &quot;about&quot; or &quot;info&quot;, with nothing useful to show for it, I see no need to continue.  And the same can be said for a game I might have spent an hour or two on, maybe even came back to later and have several rooms to look at, but no matter what I try I am stuck.\n\nI am more into meaningful exploration more than anything else.  I want to visit your world to learn of it's people and of it's events, not be trapped behind a door I can never get unlocked.  All that time and effort you put into your world for others to enjoy, your vision was a waste, because of some nifty command you wanted us to use and we never found out.  Now maybe someone else likes that type of game, but not I.  As someone else said, you can not please everyone.\n\nBut with that being said, although I have heard two different variations to the same theme, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess had some pretty decent progression of dungeon puzzles.  But what set those games apart from others was of course it's story and also it's unique combat system that others have tried to copy since and even many years later and many different consoles since, with super duper graphics and processors, are still lacking... playability and the [b:3fw09ghm][i:3fw09ghm][u:3fw09ghm]want[/b:3fw09ghm][/i:3fw09ghm][/u:3fw09ghm] to finish the game.  \n\nAnd I have found the Water Temple for both games to be the hardest of the bunch, but also about in the middle or the possibly a little after it.  That does not mean the rest of the dungeons afterward were a push over, but they did not seem, at least to me, to have the same complexity.  And each dungeon revolved around a certain tactic or new piece of equipment you found.  It was never meant to be overly frustrating.  And yet they always added âextrasâ to push those who wanted them like the pieces of the heart container to make your life 100%, etc.  And although you may be stuck, you were never truly stuck because you always had help from your partner like Navi the fairy or Midna the imp and when you passed a puzzle you felt you truly accomplished something.\n\nAnd that new found power, equipment or technique you found in the beginning becomes second nature.  Not because you had to train the skill or learn a silly command, but simply because through exploring and combat you learned it naturally as it were.  And again, it isn't just puzzles for the sake of a puzzle, it was part of the story and it is what drove you on to the finish.  No one I know wants to just sit there and do one boring puzzle after another.  I mean I know there are people out there like that, I just do not know of any.  So basically LoZ is one big puzzle game with many puzzles linking it to the finish and with some simpler ones you did not even know was a puzzle, just progression of the story, like catching all the chickens to collect a piece of a heart. Or bringing the unhatched egg to the sleeping man to wake him up.  And that is what made the game accessible to the hardcore to the casual gamer.  The game was just fun with something for every one.\n\nSo to come full circle, if you want to make the puzzles fun, do not have the player do the exact same thing every time they come to another locked door.  Resident Evil had and may still have a habit of, âhere is a locked door, let's find the correct key.  Let's call this a puzzle and have them run back with a very small inventory with dangerous creatures.â  Rinse and repeat, âoh look, let's make it a key card this time.  Oh lets have a broken emblem of two pieces, put them together and the door opens...â wow...\n\nDid it make the game any less terrifying?  Not really, maybe more so because you are forced with an already limited inventory to now not be able to carry an extra weapon or healing herb because you have to carry the keys.  Any less fun?  Possibly, because it made no sense, (They were trained special tactical units... shoot the freaking lock!?) and if you see the game and those parts for what they really were, very small areas in a sense that you were made it think the game was big because you had to keep running back and forth with the stupid keys. (Any one remember the original Halo, no puzzles as it were, but it seemed you went from point A â Z and then came right back the same way you came...) What would take me six hours, because I like to explore and check everything, can be done in half the time or less by an experienced person.  Have the ability to have no locked doors and no key runs and you could probably traverse the entire game in less than an hour.\n\nSo if you are looking for a fun puzzler, that obviously was not it.  But who says a text adventure has to have puzzles to begin with... or at least the kind that makes you even think you are doing a puzzle... just saying...",

As someone else said, you can not please everyone.<br/><br/>But with that being said, although I have heard two different variations to the same theme, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess had some pretty decent progression of dungeon puzzles.  But what set those games apart from others was of course it's story and also it's unique combat system that others have tried to copy since and even many years later and many different consoles since, with super duper graphics and processors, are still lacking... playability and the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">want</span></span></span> to finish the game.  <br/><br/>And I have found the Water Temple for both games to be the hardest of the bunch, but also about in the middle or the possibly a little after it.  That does not mean the rest of the dungeons afterward were a push over, but they did not seem, at least to me, to have the same complexity.  And each dungeon revolved around a certain tactic or new piece of equipment you found.  It was never meant to be overly frustrating.  And yet they always added âextrasâ to push those who wanted them like the pieces of the heart container to make your life 100%, etc.  And although you may be stuck, you were never truly stuck because you always had help from your partner like Navi the fairy or Midna the imp and when you passed a puzzle you felt you truly accomplished something.<br/><br/>And that new found power, equipment or technique you found in the beginning becomes second nature.  Not because you had to train the skill or learn a silly command, but simply because through exploring and combat you learned it naturally as it were.  And again, it isn't just puzzles for the sake of a puzzle, it was part of the story and it is what drove you on to the finish.  No one I know wants to just sit there and do one boring puzzle after another.  I mean I know there are people out there like that, I just do not know of any.  So basically LoZ is one big puzzle game with many puzzles linking it to the finish and with some simpler ones you did not even know was a puzzle, just progression of the story, like catching all the chickens to collect a piece of a heart. Or bringing the unhatched egg to the sleeping man to wake him up.  And that is what made the game accessible to the hardcore to the casual gamer.  The game was just fun with something for every one.<br/><br/>So to come full circle, if you want to make the puzzles fun, do not have the player do the exact same thing every time they come to another locked door.  Resident Evil had and may still have a habit of, âhere is a locked door, let's find the correct key.  Let's call this a puzzle and have them run back with a very small inventory with dangerous creatures.â  Rinse and repeat, âoh look, let's make it a key card this time.  Oh lets have a broken emblem of two pieces, put them together and the door opens...â wow...<br/><br/>Did it make the game any less terrifying?  Not really, maybe more so because you are forced with an already limited inventory to now not be able to carry an extra weapon or healing herb because you have to carry the keys.  Any less fun?  Possibly, because it made no sense, (They were trained special tactical units... shoot the freaking lock!?) and if you see the game and those parts for what they really were, very small areas in a sense that you were made it think the game was big because you had to keep running back and forth with the stupid keys. (Any one remember the original Halo, no puzzles as it were, but it seemed you went from point A â Z and then came right back the same way you came...) What would take me six hours, because I like to explore and check everything, can be done in half the time or less by an experienced person.  Have the ability to have no locked doors and no key runs and you could probably traverse the entire game in less than an hour.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for a fun puzzler, that obviously was not it.  But who says a text adventure has to have puzzles to begin with... or at least the kind that makes you even think you are doing a puzzle... just saying...",
