      "EditableText": "If you create a text adventure game, it is relatively simple. Just go into the 'Game' element on the tree of things (on the left side of the screen), go into the display tab, and scroll down until you see the background image option. This is what I do to add a background image to games. Depending upon the size of your image file, you might need to play around with the settings a bit until you get it to display properly in the game itself, but with some patience it isn't too difficult to do. \r\n\r\n As for doing it in gamebook mode...I took a quick look around, but it doesn't appear that there is any easy way to set a picture as a background. There might be some way to do it by using Javascript or some more advanced coding, but I personally don't know anything about that. Generally, I've found that while gamebook mode is designed to be an easier to use version of Quest, many times the lack of options just serves to hold you back from doing anything unique. Besides, you can make a text adventure look and play just like a gamebook, and you have the options there if you ever want to do anything more advanced. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps! ",
