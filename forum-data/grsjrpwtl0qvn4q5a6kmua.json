      "EditableText": "Hi there! \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to particularly long scenes or dialogues without branching choices, I've typically had to resort to cutting things down to smaller lots of paragraphs so that people playing don't have to scroll all the way back up to the top, having the final bit of text thrust at them before they've even started reading.\r\n\r\nI do this with 'press any key to continue' checks, but I've never really been satisfied with that, especially as I design games without text input, and that function is connected to that box, which means I have to turn it on, do the pause, then turn it off immediately every time.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there's a way I could just force the scroll back up to the top when the text is dropped, bearing in mind I clear the screen on pretty much every turn. Alternately, is there a way to stop the auto-scroll down altogether?",
