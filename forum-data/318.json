Anybody willing to help out with coding, graphics, GUI (actually no, that my speciallty), and music, sound etc, it will be much appriciated.  All games are free.  I'm planning on do a car racing game sometime next month, just a short single player one to test my knowledge with some program thing, will be available to download, and will require a decent PC to run.\n\nI'm hoping to get this really weird computer base, it's like a half-sphere with 2 green lights, 512mb RAM, 30gb HD Space, and worth about $3000 Canadian Dollars, but im getting it free hopefully.\n\nAnyway, thats just a short list of what ill be doing in the next year or so, ill be using VB in all the projects  <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\" /><!-- s:roll: -->",
