Is it possible to add  'is locked' and 'can be unlocked' and perhaps a new list 'unlock with' next to it where you can choose the object which unlocks the container? \n\nIts possible to edit the walkthrough now. Do you have plans to expand the functionality? For example to create walkthroughs automatically by recording the input of the player and ex- and importing walkthroughs.

I can't press Ctrl+F4 with one hand, so it takes &quot;too long&quot; to leave the mouse, press the keys, take the mouse and on. No, then I will use the mouse to quit the game.\n\nThere is another thing. You can change e.g. coreDescription.aslx and put it into the directory of your game. Q5 will take this modified Aslx when starting the game. Now I want to change jjmenu.css to change the popupmenu for verbs. This file will not be taken from the game-directory.  playercore.css could be a second file, you want to change. Perhaps its possible to change this?",
