      "EditableText": "Hi everyone. \r\n\r\nI'm working on a new project:\r\n\r\n## Magnetic Scrolls Remastered\r\n\r\nThe aim is to \"remaster\" the 1980's adventure games by Magnetic Scrolls for mobiles and desktop, making them friendlier to play and adding a modern, touch based UI and possibly to add extra content.\r\n\r\nThey would be released on App Stores for people to enjoy, either as free games or, possibly, charged at a small fee/lowest tier to cover inevitable direct costs (eg website hosting and Apple developer fees), with permission from copyright holders.\r\n\r\nSupported Platforms: Windows/Linux/OSX, Android & iOS.\r\n\r\nHow it would work:\r\n\r\nBuilt by combining the Brahman front-end GUI with a plugin back-end IF \"engine\". The back-end plugin is an adaptor onto the Karlsson/Kinder/Meier/Doherty magnetic emulator.\r\n\r\nThe project would be open source so anyone can tinker with the code and features for themselves afterwards.\r\n\r\nHere's a picture that shows how it might work (although the final UI is likely to be a lot different). The Brahman \"text touch\" interface, illustrates one way how these games could be made much more playable on mobile with only the bare minimum of typing required. Many other enhancements are also possible such as a Map Page and Inventory Roster with icons.\r\n\r\n![Android Demo](http://stvle.s3.amazonaws.com/bshot2.gif)\r\n\r\nI'm looking for people's opinions:\r\n\r\n1. Is this worth doing?\r\n2. Do you think it should be free or have a small charge?\r\n3. If additional gameplay or content were possible, is this a good idea?\r\n4. Is (3) still true if it means charging more to cover the effort.\r\n5. There could be a small budget for new icons/cameo pictures of objects in the games, would anyone be interested in this?\r\n6. Other ideas welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is an interesting idea, one that I'll have think about.\r\n\r\nI plan to make the mobile version nice to play with almost no typing. Regarding the icons idea. I'd like to have new icons for objects within the game. These would be small color icons that would appear on the menus and maybe within the text when you encounter those objects. The original games did not have any icons.\r\n\r\nFor anyone considering this, I would have to make definitive list of icons to come up with a cost. I don't mind paying for them, because that's fair. Any money made by the paid for version would go toward recouping this cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
