This was a conscious design choice. The text at the beginning of the game has very few object descriptions, but as the game continues, there is an opportunity to examine everything important at least once. You don't need to examine most things more than once. I didn't want to clutter the screen with unnecessary links, which would have just distracted the player. Do games that just list choices at the bottom of the screen get placed in the sandpit, too? \r\n\r\nSo how do I get my game out of the sandpit?  Is posting here the right approach, or do I contact a moderator?\r\n\r\nNigel\r\n",
