The main one being that HTML/JS can be packaged using Phonegap to create &quot;native&quot; apps for iPhone, Android etc.\n\nHere's the Quest 5 tutorial game running as an iPhone app.\n\n[attachment=0:beet6ul7]<!-- ia0 -->iphone.png<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:beet6ul7]\n\nThe app runs entirely offline, so you can play the game anywhere.\n\nIt's still early days. Clearly, the tutorial game isn't of App Store quality - this is just a proof of concept, and there's still a bit of work to do to make everything as slick as possible.",
