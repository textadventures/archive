I don't want players for instance to be able to carry 15 things unless they are in containers, being worn or otherwise equipped.  If the character has a mug of beer in one hand and a sword in the other ( a deadly combination if you ask me ) then I don't want them to be able to pick up a book.  He or she would need to put down something in order to pick up the book.  Any suggestions?",
