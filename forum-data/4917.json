Just like to say thanks to Quest's creators and anyone replying to this, Quest really is fantastic.\n\nSo my first gamebook is finished except for properly integrating some music I composed for it.\n\nI wrote a theme designed to play in the background of the entire game and loop, as the player wanders around inside of a maze, solving puzzles. I see it's easy to have a sound loop [i:3nt9us4j]on one page[/i:3nt9us4j] or use the actions tab in the quest gamebook editor and play a sound and have it continue to play after the player moves to another page but I see no option to loop the sound. I'm using the windows version of Quest, up to date.\n\nIs there anyway to code the song to loop indefinitely regardless of what page the player is on? Thank you in advance for your help.",
