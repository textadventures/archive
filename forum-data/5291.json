      "EditableText": "this deals with quest's parsing of your input (which thus also includes your Command's 'pattern' box~Attribute) and the Objects' (or whatever Elements' ~ Attributes' ) 'name' (ID) String Attribute, so using spaces with shared words, causes quest to not know what you want. So, the easiest solution is to not use spaces in your 'name' (ID) String Attribute (Elements' Names).
