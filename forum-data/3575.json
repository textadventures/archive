My english wasn't very good at the time, so I don't remember every detail of it. I have some memory of it, I hope someone knows what game this is.\nIt starts in a room, the character has no memory of it. It's pitch black. Something with a keyhole, but a key doesn't fit. There's a path and a forest. I can enter different rooms and places by saying 'go east/north/etc'. \n\nThanks in advance!",
