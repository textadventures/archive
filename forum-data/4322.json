I'm almost done with my first game and I think it will be AWESOME!! *fingers crossed*\n\nBut, I'm having one final issue I'm not sure how to approach.\n\nThe player has to drop a specific item from a tree top and hit the correct target below (spot 1, spot 2, spot 3, etc) on a grid far below.  I have commands for dropping the correct item on the correct target... no problem.\n\nHow can I create a command for dropping an incorrect item that results in that specific item falling &quot;out of the current room&quot; to the ground below?  I do not want to simply respond with a statement that says something like &quot;You cannot drop that object here.&quot;  I want to move the incorrect object from their inventory.
