When searching for GetDefiniteAlias, the only result is in Quest's Cloak of Darkness tutorial, oddly...was it later removed, and the tutorial wasn't updated? Or am I somehow using it wrong? My script is as follows:\r\n```\r\nif (not object1.parent = player) {\r\n  msg (\"You aren't carry it \" + object.article + \".\")\r\n}\r\nelse if (not object2 = hook) {\r\n  msg (\"You can't hang stuff on \" + GetDisplayName(object2) + \".\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  object1.parent = object2\r\n  msg (\"You hang \" + GetDefiniteAlias(object1) + \" on \" + GetDefiniteAlias(object2) + \".\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThank you for your help!",
