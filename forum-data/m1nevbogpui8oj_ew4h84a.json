The Visual Novel-Isometric hybrid game is set in 1950s (noir theme, mafia story arc etc) and will feature wide choices (a general outline of the plot/choices was made with Twine 2). But Noir style writing is beyond my scope and I am looking for writers.\r\nWriter(s) will have full creative freedom (obviously!) for plot/character re-development and improvement. Hobbyist and budding writers are all welcome for co-writing. I have experience with completing two games previously - a space shooter and a platformer and am looking for a reasonable time frame to finish this new project.\r\n Also, kindly provide link(s) to your works - published, ongoing project sample for a quick read.\r\n\r\nMy personal mail id is rakeshnair.engr@gmail.com\r\nAwaiting an early response,\r\nRegards,\r\nRakesh Nair",
