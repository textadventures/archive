      "EditableText": "So initially I thought I had this handled by making a command instead of a verb and then use {command:\"Command\"} in a message. But I realized that because I want to use the command when entering a room, but want to use a command by the same name but a different outcome depending on the room, I need to use a verb instead. So when my character enters a room, they get the options of the verbs \"call into the darkness\" or \"search for light\" and in each room you get back a different message.\r\nAny ideas on how to do this?",
