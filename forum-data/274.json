      "EditableText": "Hi.  I have just started evaluating Quest (looks great so far!), and have a few questions.  My apology in advance if they're stupid questions:-)\n\nWhat are the limitations of the game (number of rooms, number of objects, etc.)?\n\nThe compiled help file is good, but I sometimes like a printed manual.  Has anyone done a printable help file, tutorial, etc.?\n\nHow customizable is the gameplayer's perspective?  For example, if my game is on a deserted island, will I have to use references to rooms, doors, etc?  Or can by object references be more realistic?  Hope that makes sense!\n\nCan I have more than one character in the game?  Can I *play* more than one character in the game.  Is this what the multi-user version is for?\n\nIf these questions have already been answered somewhere, please tell me where go (to find the answers, of course).\n\nThanks!\n\nAlf",
