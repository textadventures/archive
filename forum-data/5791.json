The intended use of this file is to go into textadventures.co.uk or to be opened with a Quest client somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, you can try and get this file made into a html/javascript thing... where your game gets packaged in a folder, and the code gets put into a &quot;game.js&quot; file, which is accessed by running &quot;index.html&quot; in your web browser, theoretically running your game in chrome.\n\nThis can apparently then be packaged into an exe or mobile app using third party software such as HTMLexe (haven't tried that yet).\n\n---\n[b:1m14gbt0]\nPROBLEMS:[/b:1m14gbt0]\n\nI used a lot of images and audio so the *.quest file is quite big, and i can't upload it to textadventures.co.uk without the upload timing out.\n\nI don't want users to have to download the quest client so that is a last resort. (can you believe how many people refuse to try your game simply because they have to go through a 2 minute download/installation???)\n\nI've downloaded and used Quest-JS [https://github.com/textadventures/quest-js/releases] to convert the .quest file into html/java, but the conversion is not successful.\n\nThis is where I'm stuck.\n\nI noticed that there's no documentation on how to use the Quest-JS source code, so here's what I did. Hopefully it helps someone else in the future:\n\nThe source for Quest-JS was really confusing to me. I ended up unzipping the file and running QuestJS.sln with Visual Studio Community (which i've never used before).\n\nI then got an error saying a bunch of stuff I didn't understand about not having Microsoft SQL Express Database 2012, but I couldn't figure out how to get it installed. I think I installed it but the error didn't go away.\n\nAnyway, I went on anyway because the file was still usable.\n\nI continued by then hitting Build (ctrl+shift+B I think) on the [b:1m14gbt0]Solution[/b:1m14gbt0], since it looked like the parent object. This created a &quot;QuestCompiler.exe&quot; in \\quest-js-master\\QuestCompiler\\bin\\Debug.\n\nI ran that exe and got a GUI for converting my *.quest file into a HTML/JS folder, and so I did that without touching any of the options.\n\nWhen I try to run the resultant &quot;index.html&quot; I just get a empty game running in my browser with nothing but a dialog box saying &quot;Tap Links or Type Here...&quot;. The game doesn't run, and there seems to be no action I can take to get it to run.\n\nIn the top right corner of the &quot;index.html&quot; there's a menu you can access that correctly lists my game's details (title, author etc), and allows me to &quot;restart&quot;, &quot;undo&quot;, or &quot;wait&quot;.

You might be able to make some progress with it if you look in your browser's console log - there's probably an error in the generated JavaScript that is causing your game to not load properly. That might be because of a bug in QuestJS or because of some error in your game script (a common one is an empty &quot;if&quot; condition).\n\nThe reason I'm not maintaining QuestJS is that I've started work on an official JavaScript interpreter for Quest games, which will mean it will eventually be possible to just upload some JavaScript and your .quest file and have the game run entirely locally in the user's web browser. This will be part of Quest 6.0 which I'm hoping to release some time in 2016. (I'll get round to blogging about the updated Quest roadmap soon too)\n\nThe simplest solution for you would be to upload your game to the site and set it as unlisted. If it's timing out that's a sign that your game is too big. You can reduce the size by making sure you haven't got any massive image or sound files in there. When generating a .quest file, Quest scoops up everything in your game folder, so make sure only stuff is in there that you want to be included. Resize images as small as possible and make sure you're using compressed sounds - no huge WAV files.",

Convert all sound files to .mp3 files using a sound converter that allows for a quality edit (I used Switch Sound Converter).
