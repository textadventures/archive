It seems there's a lot of different types, or at least a lot of related applications for it. So then I googled &quot;.aslx&quot; and the first thing I saw was a documentation page for Quest, which started by saying, &quot;Quest 5.0 uses a [i:1lhlka3t]new[/i:1lhlka3t] XML-based file format...&quot;\n\nFor the purposes of using Quest, if I have a general familiarity with programming and creating classes, is there any reason for me to study XML outside of the Quest documentation provided? If so, are there any particular websites or books that you'd recommend?",
