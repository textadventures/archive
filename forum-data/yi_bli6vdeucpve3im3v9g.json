IKV has clobbered this little rascal and I would like to share that success.\r\n\r\nI start the game with a play sound script.\r\n```\r\nplay sound (\"BACKGROUND.mp3\", false, true)\r\n```\r\nAnd use the following script below to add sound effects.\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Playing audio file 2...<audio autoplay><source src=\\\"\" + GetFileURL(\"SOUNDEFFECT1.ogg\") + \"\\\" type=\\\"audio/ogg\\\" /><source src=\\\"\" + GetFileURL(\"SOUNDEFFECT1.mp3\") + \"\\\" type=\\\"audio/mp3\\\"/>Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio>\")\r\n```\r\nWell... this seems to work after all. \r\n\r\n**MAKE SURE** your .ogg files are in the same folder as your play sound.mp3 files.  When you select 'play sound' as a script, Quest automatically pulls that file into the .aslx folder.  I failed to realize I had to put the .ogg files in that same folder manually!  D'oh!\r\n\r\nLeaving this here as a solution to others.\r\n\r\nThanks KV.  You are a beast!",
