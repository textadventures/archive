The game has been designed with the needs of the blind and visually impaired in mind but is designed to be enjoyed by everyone. We recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund development on the game, and would appreciate it if you could pledge your support.\n\nThe game stars Hank Krang, a thief from the future, and his self-aware time machine, TEDI, as they go throughout time stealing priceless artifacts. In Grail to the Thief, Hank and TEDI travel to Arthurian times in search of the Holy Grail.\n\nThe Kickstarter campaign and link to a playable prototype of Grail to the Thief can be found at:\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foralltoplay/grail-to-the-thief-an-interactive-audio-adventure\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fo ... -adventure</a><!-- m -->\n\nWe would love to hear your comments and suggestions after you've had a chance to play the prototype.",
