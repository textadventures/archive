      "EditableText": "When you move to the new city, do you somehow want the new map shown relative to the old one, or do you want to wipe the map clean for the new city (but be able to go back to the old one)? I don't know of an easy way to do the first one, short of making the new city X grids away. For the second, you might be able to use different Z coordinates (e.g. the move the new city is actually an up or down. I believe that different levels are shown on different maps). It might be worth a try. \n\nIf you're doing a jump to a new room without going through an exit (e.g. with MoveObject or something on the game.pov), then you'll need to initialize the room map coordinates for the target room.",
