      "EditableText": "I was just starting with Quest 5, it seemed like a very easy to use program.\nUnfortunately it seems it tends to freeze constantly,\nto the point that it is an absolutely arduous task to make the simplest of changes,\nthe problem typically arises when i try to open a drop-down menu.\nSometimes i have to kill the program and restart it many times before it can even get further than opening an object,\ngiven enough time it also seems to be enough simply hovering over a button with the mouse for it to freeze.\nWhen it doesn't freeze sometimes it takes several seconds before buttons and text-fields respond,\nand the program is using around 50% of my CPU. I don't know if that's normal, but it seems a bit much.\n\nI didn't find any similar threads.\nIs there something to do about it? or do i give up?",
