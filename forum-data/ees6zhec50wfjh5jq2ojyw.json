What was easy/hard and what did you get out of the experience?\r\n\r\nI'm using this <a hred=\"https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html#Untextured_Raycaster_\">article</a> to create a raycasting project in Quest. I get the general idea of it but maybe I'm just dumb because reading the actual theory of it made my head hurt. I just skipped down to its implementation. Figured I'll understand the theory better as I build the project.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on creating a 2D map generator that's in the custom status menu that I'll later raycast into a 3d map for the Player to walk around in. Initially, I'm going to generate an empty room with walls around the border. Then I'll try to generate individual rooms  and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n",
