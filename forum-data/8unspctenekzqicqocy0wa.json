      "EditableText": "(Edit: typo)\r\nA recent thread has prompted me to pick up work on a huge javascript thing that I started for my Easter game (I think 2 years ago?)\r\n\r\nThe brief would be allowing the side panes to be arbitrarily rearranged; having the panes on either side; putting the panes on one side, but overflowing to the other when they reach screen height; or putting some panes on each side. Allowing the player to drag panes up and down to change their order; allowing the player to drag to resize panes; allow the player to 'pop out' panes and have them as floating windows, or docked in the map/panel area at the top of the display (with JS functions so that a game author can easily choose which things the player is allowed to change).\r\n\r\nBut because I was building it as a structured framework, that would make it easier to implement other systems. Like allowing the placesobjects and/or inventory panes to be displayed as 'classic' (list), 'description' (when the room description reaches the top of the page, it stops scrolling and sticks there, and the \"You can see\" line changes as objects are added/removed), 'icon grid' (that has its own post), and 'indented' (with or without expand/collapse buttons). But then I think… there's a second, independent set of options there. You could have the pane-style \"verb buttons\", or give them a popup menu like object links in the game text. Or you could have a select style (so you click a command in the commands pane and then an object to use it on), or \"Monkey Island\" style, where selecting objects in the sidebar just types them in the command bar (so you can click \"put in\" in the command pane, \"stapler\" in the inventory, and \"drawer\" in the placesobjects, and it types \"put stapler in drawer\" in the command bar, ready for you to submit it by pressing enter or doubleclicking the last item; or you could select/deselect items to change the command before sending it.\r\n\r\nAnd then you've got the option to 'pop out' containers (creating a new objects tab for an open container; so you could have \"Inventory\", \"Objects\", and \"Backpack\" separate tabs; possibly showing a wait pointer and sending \"put X in Y\" commands when an object is moved.\r\n(Hmm… if I can get multi-object displayverbs working (having \"put __ in [container]\" or \"use [inventory] on __\" on the displayverbs list) then it would be reasonable to have a verb menu pop up if the player drags one object onto another. That would make the UI a little more intuitive)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how long this will take. It's all easy code, but writing it all (while not breaking mobile) would be quite tedious. So I've been putting it off for ages.\r\n\r\nBut… that's what I'm working on Quest-wise right now.\r\n\r\nAs far as other projects… I'm trying to get my author rank back up both by making a different book free on Kindle every week (currently *<a style=\"all: inherit; cursor: pointer\" href=\"https://mybook.to/12comedies\">A Dozen Comedies</a>*, but I think I'm going to start *<a style=\"all: inherit; cursor: pointer\" href=\"https://mybook.to/insidethebox\">Inside The Box</a>* tomorrow); and also announcing that if anyone reads my books on <span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-dbs/hz/signup?tag=goaorilif-21\" style=\"all: inherit; cursor: pointer\">Kindle Unlimited</a></span> this month, the proceeds will go to <a href=\"https://www.cavellnursestrust.org/\">Cavell Nurses' Trust</a>, so people signing up for a free trial can read my books for nothing, and give money (½¢) to charity for every page they read.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm spending a lot of time making a series of videos, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN0AeP1bfcK70_lA_r9F1mzNZkmvchCdK\">How NOT to Write a Novel</a>, charting my progress with Camp NaNoWriMo.

And in case people haven't seen enough of my face, I'm also doing a half hour every day on <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/angelwedge\">Twitch</a>, streaming my efforts to play old games (currently on *Magicland Dizzy*).\r\n\r\nAnd… stuck at mum's house, as I was visiting when they announced this lockdown and I think you're not supposed to use trains unless it's essential. So going for lots of long walks too :) I've set myself a challenge to see as much as possible of the area around here, without ever repeating a walk or crossing one of my previous paths. It's proving quite a challenge; I've put up some videos on relive.cc, and I'm challenging my dad to guess what my rules for determining the route were.
