I appreciate you make this clear on your welcome screen, but I suspect most people wont read it.\r\n\r\nI remember your reasoning for this approach was to encourage players to actually read the text, rather than just click on random links. The problem is, your current set-up actually encourages the reverse, because links are initially visible but then fade to become more obscure - so the tendency is to click the links the moment you see them.\r\n\r\nIf anything, I'd suggest having the links become more noticeable as time passes. This would prevent random clicking, but also avoid player frustration.\r\n\r\nI still haven't played through the whole game yet, but my initial thoughts are:\r\n\r\n- As you know, I think the short descriptions work well. I appreciate they get more wordy as the game progresses, but keeping it brief in the early stages gets the player invested without requiring too much commitment. Too many text adventures want new players to read thousands of words before they even get a say in the story, so it's a nice chance to be able to slowly immerse yourself.\r\n- The sound effects are very good. A very nice touch that you seemingly refrain from getting carried away with.\r\n- The setting is a little cliche as far as text adventures / gamebooks go, but it's clear you've spent a lot of time thinking about the world and I do find myself eager to explore.\r\n- It might just be me and my lack of imagination, but I found it hard to build a mental image of where I was in \"the world\". I was going north here, east there... but I couldn't map out the route I was taking in my mind. I would love a crude hand drawn map plotting my progress!\r\n- When I pick things up, it would be nice to have some sort of inventory.\r\n\r\n**potential spoiler**\r\n\r\n- I like the deaths I have encountered so far (I very much deserved to be shot after looking out the window knowing a sniper was outside).
