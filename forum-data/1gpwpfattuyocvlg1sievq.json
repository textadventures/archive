It will need to check for itself if the player is present to see it happened (or use PrintIfHere).\r\n\r\nFor standard moves, you can now override the templates, or the NpcLeaving function (which   tells the player which way the NPC was heading).\r\n  \r\nIf game.npcdebug is set to true, you will see debugging info in blue; this will tell you what NPCs are dong and planning to do, which should help you work out why they are not behaving.\r\n  \r\nThere are also groups now; NPCs can join groups and act together whilst in the group...\r\n\r\nGroups\r\n------\r\n\r\nAn NPC can belong to one or zero groups. Membership is indicated by the \"group\" attribute. Use the `GroupMembers(group)` function to get a list of members. The group alias is the members of the group (use its \"resetalias\" script to set; the built-in functions do this for you).\r\n\r\nA group has actions just as an NPC does (in fact they inherit from NPC). When an NPC is in a group, her actions are not done, but will resume if she leaves the group.\r\n\r\nAn NPC can \"Join\" a group, or a group can \"Include\" an NPC. Either way, the group object will be moved to the location of the NPC, but any members will not, so you should ensure the NPC is in the same room when joining a group with other members.\r\n\r\nWhen the group moves via an action, all members do too.\r\n\r\nUse the `Pause` function to pause an NPC for one turn; this will ensure the whole group pauses if appropriate.\r\n\r\nWaitFor will make a group wait until the specified NPC joins the group. Count will wait until the number of members in the group is equal to the \"count\" attribute of the given object (which may well be the group itself).\r\n\r\nActions...\r\nFor NPCs only: Get, Drop, Wear, Remove, Join\r\nFor groups only: Include, Exclude, Disband, WaitFor, Count\r\nFor either, but with groups a random member is picked: Open, Close, Lock, Unlock, Give\r\nFor either: Move, Search, Pause, Wait, GoTo, GoToParent, Script\r\n\r\n\r\n_So what can you do with this?_\r\n\r\nBy way of an example, let us suppose Mary and Bob are breaking into a house together, taking two things, then leaving together. Suppose we start with Mary waiting for Bob on the street corner. Start her in a group by setting her \"group\" attribute. The group could then \"WaitFor\" Bob, to \"Join\" the group.\r\n\r\nThe group could then go to the hall location inside the house, at which point it could \"Disband\" (disband does not need an object, so just send it player as a kind of default). Each NPC will then do their own thing, Mary going to the kitchen to get a knife, Bob to the attic to get a painting, then come back and join the group. The group, with \"count\" set to 2, waits for its membership Count to get to 2, at which point the group heads back to the street corner, to await the player.\r\n\r\nHere is how it is set up:\r\n\r\n_Mary (starts in the `street corner` location, with her \"group\" attribute set to the `Mary and Bob group` object)._\r\n\r\nMove:kitchen\r\nGet:knife\r\nMove:hall\r\nJoin:Mary and Bob group\r\n\r\n_Bob_\r\n\r\nGoTo:street corner\r\nJoin:Mary and Bob group\r\nGoTo:attic\r\nGet:painting\r\nGoTo:hall\r\nJoin:Mary and Bob group\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mary and Bob group (has its \"count\" attribute set to 2)_\r\n\r\nGoTo:hall\r\nDisband:player\r\nCount:Mary and Bob group\r\nGoTo:street corner\r\nWait:player\r\n",

I was just curious as to how I could bypass that pause.  I wouldn't have thought about it, but I read in the notes that the pause was added in the second version of the library.  So, I deduced that there was originally no pause.  (I know... I'm *so* clever!  Cough... Choke...)  Hence, there must be a script which calls the actions with no pause.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis library is super-awesome, by the way!",
