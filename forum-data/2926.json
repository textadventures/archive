Also, I've been awake for almost 24 hours now and it seemed like a good idea.\n\nIn any case, it's a pretty ridiculous game so have fun with it. Try taking things multiple times, smelling things, dancing, speaking to people who don't exist, taking objects that don't exist, and even dying. Uhhh, not sure what else to say about it at the moment. *falls unconscious*",
