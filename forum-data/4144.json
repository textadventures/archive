      "EditableText": "Hello!\n\nI have a question. I started with this program is amazing. I created a room just for the introduction where some texts appear on start. After intro i use a script for moving the player to the official start room. So when I use the script [b:21n2k4ss]move object (player) to object (room)[/b:21n2k4ss] i get the description of the destination room&gt; and appears twice, two times... i don't know why.\n\nIf I disable the option &quot;show room description&quot; this does not happen, but then no description is displayed in any room.\nI want the description whenever one enters the room. This problem only occurs when I move the character using the script [b:21n2k4ss]MoveObject (player, room)[/b:21n2k4ss], after that descriptions appear normally. I'm using Quest 5.5\n\n[b:21n2k4ss]any help with this? [/b:21n2k4ss]\n\nthank you very much in advance!",
