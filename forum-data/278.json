Can he then use the lumber to build a house?  Will the lumber and house be objects?\n\nOn a totally unrelated note, is the Colossal Cave available for Quest?  The first time I played it was on a mainframe a *long* time ago.  I'm not sure, but I think the code was COBOL.\n\nThanks!\n\nAlf",

      "EditableText": "You can indeed dynamically create objects, using the \"create object\" command if you're hand-coding ASL, or in QDK with the \"Create an object\" command in the \"Objects\" category.\n\nHowever it might be easy if you just set the \"lumber\" object up and have it unavailable (\"hidden\" in ASL). Then it will not appear in the room - just as if it didn't exist. Then, when the player uses the saw on the tree, hide the tree and show the \"lumber\" object. Voila - you've chopped down the tree!\n\nI'm not aware of any implementations of Colossal Cave, or any other classic adventure games for that matter. I'd be very interested to see it though if someone wants to have a stab at it.",
