So far I've received some feedback from peers and friends, but I think text adventure players might have more pointed comments about the writing and format, so here we are!\r\n\r\nYou'll be added to the _**Special Thanks**_ section of the game if you leave actionable feedback I end up integrating!\r\n\r\n**Game Synopsys:** The colonists aboard Bean II struggle to find meaning after Earth stops responding to communications, putting their lifelong purpose into question. Players explore the off-world mining colony ship, navigate multi-linear character relationships, and steer the story toward one of five endings.",
