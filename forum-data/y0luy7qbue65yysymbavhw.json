I know its possible, as the quest tutorial site mentions it as a possibility to change, for example, \"go east\" to \"go to the kitchen\" and I somehow managed to work it out in a quest project I was working on a few months back that I'm picking up again - hopefully to finish this time. But I can't seem to find out how its done. If anybody would be kind enough to lend me an assist, I'd be most appreciative. If I managed to work it out before such a reply is posted, I'll also update/comment on this post to make sure nobody loses any time answering a solved problem. \r\n\r\nI would like to clarify, I know for a fact its possible without scripting as i did not use scripting to make it happen the last time. My game simply has each exit in a specific area have both the exit name and alias as the same thing, with directional input (that doesnt actually show up on the compass within the room). As an example, one of my rooms is called \"Entryway\" and within the \"exits\" tab, there are no marker laid on the compass, but the actual exits are called \"kitchen\" \"atrium\" and \"bathroom\" with the aliases names respectively. The kitchen is to the north, atrium to the east and bathroom to the south. I didnt change their names, nor do i have any text input in the room descriptions (no exit scripts) \r\n\r\nThe input in the actual gameplay has the exits marked as viewable objects and locations, both seperately. So you can \"look at\" the exit and \"go\" through it. You can also try to \"take\" the object, which i think is funny, and you cannot, in fact, take the room - which is good. \r\n\r\nThe bizarre thing is, these rooms are, statistically, identical to the ones ive created the ordinary way - barring their alias, hence this query.
