      "EditableText": "Thanks. Was pleased to hear you have taken on Squiffy development. I've found it to be a very useful authoring tool, particularly given its versatility and ability to use Javascript freely. \r\n\r\nMight not be the best place to discuss, but one thing that was a pain was Squiffy's injection of p tags to open and close each section. That's fine for people that want the default styling, but if you're using your own HTML you end up with DIVS and other blocks nested in paragraph tags, which isn't good. \r\n\r\nI've carried out fairly extensive modifications to the template files, but never found a way to prevent the p tag injection - instead having to remove the offending tags from the story.js file post-compile with a simple find and replace. \r\n\r\nNot the end of the world, but given Squiffy is very much set up for coders thanks to its flexibility, it would be helpful to disable this, or maybe offer a \"dev\" mode where this and other injected elements (like the HR tag) are disabled by default. \r\n\r\nAlso, the way Squiffy saves causes issues for iPhone and Mac users that enable private browsing. It essentially causes a failure to load. As far as I can tell it's because of the strange way that Apple's OS restricts  localStorage.setItem when in private browsing mode. \r\n\r\nThere's no easy fix without a rewrite of the save system, but as a half way house you can detect the presence of private browsing restrictions and show a warning using something like:\r\n\r\n    Try { localStorage.test = 2; } catch (e)  {\r\n    Your error code;\r\n    } \r\n\r\nMight be worth including a check by default. \r\n\r\nIn terms of a fix I did start playing around with making use of WebSQL and a cookie solution, but in the end it wasn't worth the hassle.
