The only thing I noticed was once you take the space suit, you have both options to \"suit up\" (nice touch!) and \"remove suit\" available.  Probably should make only one available i.e. \"suit up\" when not wearing it, and \"remove suit\" when wearing it.  So far, I really like it - felt like I was going to die on the ship!",
