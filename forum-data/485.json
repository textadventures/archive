      "EditableText": "[b:2xp7z19w]Get Out Of The House[/b:2xp7z19w] by Steve Lingle\n\n\nI started this game fully expecting to give up within five minutes (a common thing when playing a Quest game) but I actually found myself quite liking it. It's not perfect - a long way from perfect in fact - but it's amusingly written and has some nice touches and seems, for the first time, to be a Quest game that might actually be worth playing.\n\nThe storyline makes little sense, although the game does tell you this to begin with. In short: you're in a house and must escape. That's the gist of it. In fact, that's the entire storyline from start to finish. Nothing particularly engaging but then engaging storylines aren't a requirement of text adventures.\n\nThe location descriptions are okay for the most part and a few have nice comic touches, but they're also a little jarring in that most of them begin with a short line telling you which location you're in and then, several lines further down, you get another line telling you which location you're in. There's also needless duplication of exits: they're nicely listed at the beginning of the location description so you know which way to go and then described again in the actual body of the text. Some of this might be the fault of the program but it's something that the writer should, and probably is, capable of correcting and really should have done.\n\nMost static (non-moveable) items are described which is a refreshing change from other Quest games I've played, although unfortunately most of these descriptions are lacking in depth and often last for no more than a few words. The description of the TV is quite unusual in that it says \"it's a TVâ€¦ with buttons!!!\" but trying to use the buttons or, indeed, examine them gives the default message that they're not there. Is it possible to watch the TV? I never discovered a way.\n\nAfter I'd been playing the game for a while, I seemed to have accumulated several items that I didn't have a clue what to do with. In desperation, I typed a few commands looking for a hints system. Fortunately, there is a hints system - albeit not a very good one. More often than not, the hint given is next to useless. Typing \"hint\" when faced with a locked door advises that I might need a key to open itâ€¦\n\nObvious Errors\nTrying to examine the table in the dining room hit me with the grammatically-challenged \"there's currently no cards anywhere in sight\". A strange response to give to someone trying to examine a table.\n\nIn the kitchen, I picked up a chair (and was surprised to be told \"You find just enough room in your pocket to carry a kitchen chair.\") and was advised I could place it atop a table. However, when I tried I was told, quite bizarrely, that I was carrying no such thing! Yet upon checking my inventory, I discovered that I did, indeed, have the chair. I just couldn't seem to get the game to realise that.\n\nThe description of the mantle informs you that there are several items on top of it yet trying to examine the mantle produces no further hints and if there are items there, I've no idea what they might be.\n\nI start the game sitting on a couch but once I stand up from it, I'm not able to sit back down. Not an error as such, I guess, but the sort of thing that really should have been covered for the sake of completeness.\n\nTyping \"look\" whilst in the den shows the room description and finishes off with a few lines about you walking into the den even though you're already in there. The same error blights the bathroom.\n\nThe end of the living room description contains \"It's your average living room with the normal furniture: couch, shelf, TV. Kitchen, north.\" Surely the last two words are a typo?\n\nOpening the window in the den gives the strangest message I've ever seen in a game: that my arms have been pulled off and are now lying on the carpet! Strange as this is, it's not half as strange as attempting to open the window again and seeing the exact same command displayed again and again andâ€¦ Worse still, trying to pick up or examine my severed arms tells me that they can't be seen anywhere. Nor am I able to examine the carpet. Is this something the writer included in the game which was meant to kill the player off? Or is it merely a very poorly written piece of the game? Probably a bit of both. The same thing happens when trying to open the front door as well so either the player has an endless supply of arms, or the game just doesn't keep very good track of what has happened previously.\n\nAwkward Puzzles\nUpon picking up the bottle I discovered there was a key rattling around inside it yet was unable to open the bottle. A default message flashed up telling me that I couldn't do that. Why? Beats me. I was also unable to smash the bottle because that command - surely an obvious one when an item is stuck inside a smashable object - wasn't covered.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, Get Out Of The House is a game with far too many rough edges to be called good, but it's nevertheless quite likeable all the same. It's certainly the first Quest game I've played where I wasn't hit with an immediate desire to send it shooting to the recycle and try something else instead. I've listed a large number of errors above - and I came across a fair few that I didn't have the time or the inclination to cover - yet I felt that for the first time there was an actual game worth playing here. It's probably not a good thing to say that it was \"good by Quest standards\" as that tends to imply that it's only good because all the other games have been so downright awful, but as far as Quest games go, it's decidedly better than average. If the errors could be fixed, it might even be considered \"great by Quest standards\".\n\n4 out of 10",

      "EditableText": "Okay. I checked the situation with the mantle and the room description says (twice) that there are a few items on the mantle, but it doesn't say what. However, examining the mantle hits you with [i:1fhhoy34]\"A glare beams off and hits you right in the eye.  \"ow\" you say.\"[/i:1fhhoy34]\n\nThere's a pencil listed in the room description which I can take, and a vase which I can't - no reason given for why I can't take the vase. But the room description stays the same once the pencil is taken which made me think the pencil wasn't on the mantle and that some other items were. Ideally, if the pencil is on the mantle then the room description should change once I pick it up (the pencil, that is, not the mantle).\n\nRe the bottle: I can see where I was going wrong with that. \"open bottle\" and \"remove cork\" didn't work and it never occurred to me to try \"pull cork\" as the other two seemed like more obvious commands. No big deal really as pulling the cork doesn't open the bottle, but most of the time people will go for the most obvious and straightforward command - \"open bottle\" in this case - so it's always a good idea to cover for that.\n\n\nHere's hoping you fix the probs with the game and upload an amended version. I'm sure it'll be worth playing.",

However, examining the mantle hits you with <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"A glare beams off and hits you right in the eye.  \"ow\" you say.\"</span><br/><br/>There's a pencil listed in the room description which I can take, and a vase which I can't - no reason given for why I can't take the vase. But the room description stays the same once the pencil is taken which made me think the pencil wasn't on the mantle and that some other items were.

I can't get at QDK from the machine I'm on, but I do know that it takes a bit of work.  Stuff like checking flags.  I've found that often I wanted to do this, but couldn't be bothered and so found another way to continue the storyline.",
