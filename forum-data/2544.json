And I want to set up a script, I think, that will return whatever he types in and puts it into the Right-side pane (where I set up a bunch of &quot;status variables&quot; for a D&amp;D-like experience). Since this computer program seems to have no differentiation between lower case lettering and upper case lettering, though it may not seem very important, I would like to have the player's name(s) displayed capitalized. I'm kind of nitpicky when it comes to grammar and spelling, especially in a book-like display.\n\nI might have some other questions later on as it seems when I solve one problem, 10 more crop up. <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> For right now, I'll do them one at a time, in order of display for the game I am creating.
