For example, before you select you gender, you can Command~hyperlink click on 'male' and 'female', getting a popup window that tells about them, for example 'males' get an extra +1 strength and +1 endurance at every lvlup and females get an extra +1 dexterity and +1 agility at every lvlup, and then when done reading it, you return to the gender selection text.
