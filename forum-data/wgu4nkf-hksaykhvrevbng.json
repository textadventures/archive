I actually modified the player.changedparent script by adding\r\n```\r\nplayer.LastRoom = oldvalue\r\n```\r\nand using that as a proxy for identifying the last exit the player used.  Also works for teleporting!  My method won't work if you have multiple exits from room A to room B, but I don't have that in my game.",
