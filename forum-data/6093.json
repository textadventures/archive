A scene is composed by a description and from one to four choices. Some choices are always available, while others may not be shown unless you match its prerequisites (your character being of a given race/background, having that mighty sword with you or not, and so on). In addition, many of your choices are stored by the game allowing us to entangle the story-line of [b:liwdiljq]all[/b:liwdiljq] our quests with one another.\nSome choices have a check on your character as well: you may succeed or fail at those depending on your statistics, equipment or previous choices. Beware! Some choices could lead you into deadly combats (yes, we also feature a text-based combat system), traps, and all sort of perils and once your character dies... he/she dies and that's it! Create a new hero and start all over again with an entirely different story.\nAs you progress through the game, you will face moral dilemmas and your reputation in the eyes of the world and the factions will change accordingly.\nLast but not the least, you can resign your hero/villain. In doing so, you will send the score and statistics of your character to our online leaderboard but you won't be able to play as them anymore... Just create a new character and start over again! There will be time-framed online events such as [i:liwdiljq]the most evil of the month[/i:liwdiljq], [i:liwdiljq]the richest of the week[/i:liwdiljq], and so on and forth.\nOnce the character is on the leaderboard, he/she will also be browsable and sharable: apart from their stats, you will send their look (and equipment), achievements and one of the several titles he/she may have earned during their adventurous life!\nThe decision to have your character participating to the online leaderboard is completely up to you. If you are not into competitive gaming, or you want to keep your characters for yourself, fear not: you can just resign them.\n\n\n[color=#BF0000:liwdiljq][b:liwdiljq]Game Features:[/b:liwdiljq][/color:liwdiljq]\n[list:liwdiljq]\n[*:liwdiljq][b:liwdiljq]Choices MATTER:[/b:liwdiljq] a lot of games say so, but we think none truly mean it.
