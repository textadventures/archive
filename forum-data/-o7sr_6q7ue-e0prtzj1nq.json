I don't understand the expression player.weapon=null (forgive my post formatting if that's incorrect), mainly because I don't understand what allows an object to apply to it as a weapon. Is it attribute-related?\r\n",

      "EditableText": "Hey\r\nYou can create an object that serves as a weapon (called sword) and then create the weapon attribute in the player object, click the drop down and select \"object\" then from the drop down below it select sword. Or you could just type player.weapon = sword. Just like that the sword equals player.weapon. What you want to do with that is up to you. You can for example check if the player.weapon equals sword to see if the player can cut tree branches in the forest to clear a path.\r\n\r\nPlayer.weapon = null just says that the player has no weapon or have not equipped it, so they can't it. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the code view simplifies everything more than you think. It made everything easier for me as soon as I figured it out.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reply if you didn't get your answer.\r\n",
