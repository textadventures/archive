It worked with everything except for &quot;speak to&quot;, for some reason, and somehow I ended up with the commands &quot;look at&quot; and &quot;speak to&quot; in the right text box not working anymore. Then I noticed the verbs in other files had been effected as well. I managed to kind of repair the text box (I erased the German game, and the buttons now seem to work again except in one game that has already been effected too much), and I can use the commands again, but I just can't fix the question box (it still says &quot;ja&quot; and &quot;nein&quot; instead of &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;). I tried text editor, but the default vocabulary doesn't show up in there. Is there a way I can repair this?",
