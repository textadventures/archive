      "EditableText": "I have a script that changes the colours of the rooms, after a player changes objects. After changing the colours of the rooms(on a randomizer) correctly, it spits out several lines of \r\nError running script: Error evaluating expression 'DictionaryItem(coordinates, coordinate)': The given key was not present in the dictionary.\r\nIt says this 2 or 3  hundred times. I've tried to count, but more times than rooms I have, (and more times than four times the rooms I have, there being four possible colours).\r\nOne mistake it makes is it draws the central room the player is in and all the immediately connected rooms, but not the rooms those rooms connect to, as well. After that, it draws them as the exits are crossed into the rooms connecting to them. The original draw script drew all the boxes, so maybe it's a one time thing, a default, not a mistake, but if there are no mistakes, the error message is printing either way.\r\n\r\nHELP!!!",

      "EditableText": "Hmm… that seems odd. It looks like some function is trying to access grid coordinates without first checking if the room has been added to the map. This is most often seen when it comes to teleporting the player to a room that isn't on the map.\r\n\r\nAre you changing the player object? I'm not sure how to go about initialising the new player object's coordinate dictionary in that case; because `InitPOV` doesn't seem to do it.

      "EditableText": "Yes, ChangePOV is hiding the player grid or start grid, and the new grid is accurate. One of my scripts (don't ask me which one) is making it predraw rooms as soon as they are connected to the room the new player is in. One of my scripts (don't ask 2) is calling up an error message, but I don't know what the game isn't doing. It's doing everything I asked it to, at least.\r\nI did use a game start script to call a function to predraw the map of all rooms, but the description says it only affects connected rooms. I tried to recall the function after changing players but it did not make the error stop, start, or change. I deleted that, but of course it's still the same error coming up.",
