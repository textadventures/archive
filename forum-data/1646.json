Spend two full days with nothing but programming the game and I've managed to do all the battle codes, so now you can attack monsters and players (in pvp zones) and monsters can attack you and other monsters. And monsters can gain exp and level up jsut like players... in fact they run off all the same procedures!!! Scary? Need to tweek it so monsters can attack each toher when there's no palyer in the room though. All shop stuff and equiping works perfectly... Currently doing object cloning and spawning, which with then be expanded for monsters... All npc's can move independant around the maps, follow palyers around, and attack stuff. Feel of the game is good, I've even managed to make independant timers for players to make cutscenes and an intro for palyes (something Tron said couldn't be done in quest, I showed him!). The next stuff on my list is to finish off all the stats stuff, increasing them when you level, and modifiers (base for them at least)... after that all the system stuff for the alpha will be done. Just need to make the real maps and story lines, etc and it'll be ready!!! Tron's helping a bit on story ideas, but I'd appriate anybody else wanting to help on this part of the game (and getting their name on the cedits!!! OMG!!!)",

I'm going to try jsut changing '#quest.currentroom[userid]#' to game on selecting the monsters and test if that allows al monsters to attack. The only fear is if lots of people are playing the afterturn script will go crazy... Oh well that's what the testing is for I guess.\r\n\r\nAnyway, going to go now, Got a free period, then lunch then another free period so should be able to get lots of programming done.\r\n\r\nAlso just wondering, how big is your game now? The previous version I had was huge.... Seeing the new stuff you've put I'm wondering how much bigger it is!!",

I'm going to try jsut changing '#quest.currentroom[userid]#' to game on selecting the monsters and test if that allows al monsters to attack. The only fear is if lots of people are playing the afterturn script will go crazy... Oh well that's what the testing is for I guess.<br/><br/>Anyway, going to go now, Got a free period, then lunch then another free period so should be able to get lots of programming done.<br/><br/>Also just wondering, how big is your game now? The previous version I had was huge.... Seeing the new stuff you've put I'm wondering how much bigger it is!!",

Added colours to the battle texts, red for you were hit, green if you hit your target. I also got monster spawning perfect - in the test map whne you enter a room it'll spawn a giant rat for you to kill (A hyper one that always attacks you too), it actually checks to see if there's a spare giant rat in the monster store room, if there is it moves that one to where it wants, otherwise it makes a clone of the 'back-up' copy of the monster and grabs that one. This means that therre's enough rats to go around but the onject will keep being used and reused. (The monsters are moved back to the store room and healed back to normal stats when killed).\r\n\r\nThere's only normal physical attacks so far with damage changing with your weapon and enemy's armour then an added bit a variance...\r\n\r\nI think it's getting very nearly ready for first alpha now. I just to do a few more things and it's ready. Can everybody here who wants to test it let me know somehow? Also if sme-one can come up with a really cool name for the starting city I'll give them a prize!!!\r\n\r\nSteve, I'll be needing that server very soon though I amy be able to do some of my own hosting over the holidays... I'd like to get my site in order before them though.... kk??",
