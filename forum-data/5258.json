Your current Visibility score would always be displayed on the screen, and it is affected by the equipment you're carrying and certain events. \n\nTo the player object, I added a &quot;visibility&quot; attribute (integer) of value 0. I added a &quot;visibility&quot; status attribute with a blank value.\n\nTo a weapon object (called &quot;weapon&quot;), I gave a &quot;visibility&quot; attribute. For the value, I wrote a script&#058;\n\n[quote:ytghfnfi]if (Got(weapon)) {\n  player.visibility = player.visibility +2\n}\nelse {\n  player.visibility = player.visibility +0\n}[/quote:ytghfnfi]\n\nThe intention was to make it so that, if the player is carrying the object, their visibility would go up by 2. If they're not carrying it, it does not affect their visibility.\n\nBut, when I run the game, whether or not they're carrying the object &quot;weapon,&quot; I only see &quot;Visibility: &quot; on the main screen. I assume I at least did something wrong on the player settings, but I am not sure what. Could anyone tell me what I did wrong?",

      "EditableText": "Sounds like two different issues. The first is that you should see &quot;Visibility: 0&quot;. I am not sure, but that could be because of capitalisation. Quest is looking for &quot;Visibility&quot;, but you have put in &quot;visibility&quot;. Try deleting it from the statis attributes, and putting in &quot;visibility&quot; and &quot;Visibility: !&quot; (the exclamation mark tells Quest to put the value there).\n\nThe second issue is that your if/else may never get triggered. Where is the script? I would put it in the take and drop scripts. When you take a weapon, visiubility goes up two, when you drop it, it goes down two.\n\nThis probably has not answered your question, but hopefully has set you in the right direction. If it is still not working, it might be a good idea to paste in your game code.",
