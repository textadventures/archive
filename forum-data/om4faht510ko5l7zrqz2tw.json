Anyway, is there a way to download gamebooks, specifically ones you didn't create, on a mobile device? There's one I really love and that runtime error thing freaked me out so I'm trying to find a way to download it so I'll no longer have to worry about that, and this may be pushing it but maybe even play it offline?",

If I download a gamebook that way, will it continue to work even after the eventual time this website is no more? If not, your help is appreciated, but I would like to be able to download it in a way I can play it for the rest of my lifespan if this website stops working within it. And I constantly forget that the wayback machine exists, so that's not the most ideal option. Either way, I do appreciate your help!",
