It would have a verb like &quot;Look at&quot; or &quot;Get help&quot; or something. (I notice you don't have a player object in your game, using the default constructed one. If you wanted to go this route, just create your own player object and then create a &quot;Help&quot; object inside it.)\n\nAnother way: use some HTML to place the help button somewhere. For example, in my current game, I have a bar of links on the bottom instead of the command prompt. If you could describe where you'd like it to be, I should be able to help you get it there. (There isn't a commands pane as such. It would be easier to place a button than to place an entirely new pane, but it has been done before with some difficulty.)\n\nHope that helps!",

      "EditableText": "I have downloaded your game and played it and that will be the focus of my reply.\n\nBut...As it is anyone can have a look at your source code that may not be desirable. Using publish to create a .quest file won't be online unless you upload it and is far better to hand out. I do not see the problem having it online and just not list your game to the public. You can hand out the link to those who would like to test it. Anyway...\n\nThe story is obviously good. The hints helped a lot in the beginning but as you progress and you are unsure of what to do next, trying some actions revealed no hint and I just end up starting at the top and try everything. I do not have sound at the moment and sadly I could not hear the heartbeat - I am sure it would add to the feel of the game.\n\nIt is a good idea to ditch the command bar in your game as it is not needed. There is nothing really broken apart from some action you try not doing or saying anything.

So now a player can see if he can get the perfect score. \n\nI did enjoy the story as I haven't read this ever before. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

Using publish to create a .quest file won't be online unless you upload it and is far better to hand out. I do not see the problem having it online and just not list your game to the public. You can hand out the link to those who would like to test it. Anyway...<br/><br/>The story is obviously good.
