For the others, we check the number. If there were more than 3 options to cycle through, you would put extra `else if` cases before the final `else`. For example:\r\n<pre><code>if (not HasInt (this, \"times_talked\")) {\r\n  msg (\"This is the first thing the guy says.\")\r\n  this.times_talked = 1\r\n}\r\nelse if (this.times_talked = 1) {\r\n  msg (\"This is the second thing the guy says.\")\r\n  this.times_talked = 2\r\n}\r\n<b>else if (this.times_talked = 2) {\r\n  msg (\"This is the third thing the guy says.\")\r\n  this.times_talked = 3\r\n}\r\nelse if (this.times_talked = 3) {\r\n  msg (\"This is the fourth thing the guy says.\")\r\n  this.times_talked = 4\r\n}</b>\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"This is the last thing the guy says.\")\r\n  this.times_talked = null\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\nOr if you have a lot of options, it might be easier to use 'switch'.\r\n```\r\nif (HasInt (this, \"times_talked\")) {\r\n  this.times_talked = (this.times_talked % 3) + 1\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  this.times_talked = 1\r\n}\r\n\r\nswitch (this.times_talked) {\r\n  case (1) {\r\n    msg (\"This is the first thing the guy says.\")\r\n  }\r\n  case (2) {\r\n    msg (\"This is the second thing the guy says.\")\r\n  }\r\n  case (3) {\r\n    msg (\"This is the third thing the guy says.\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the `else` clause sets the attribute to 1 the first time, and `% 3` causes the attribute to cycle through the numbers 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3…\r\n\r\nAnother alternative method would be to give the NPC a stringlist attribute containing all his dialogue; but that's likely more than you need, unless you're going to be adding and removing lines from the cycle in response to other events.\r\n\r\n(If you'd prefer explanations using the script-editing GUI, just click code view for the verb and paste the code in, then you can see what it looks like in the GUI)",
