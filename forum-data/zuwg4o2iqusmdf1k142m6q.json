I'm not too familiar with the code flow outside of `story.js`.\r\nThis might still break because of the lack of a story ID (resetting in this case could possibly corrupt a player's saves for other Squiffy and Quest6 games)\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work, I've got a decompiler, but it's designed to take the `story.js` of a published game as its input, and this preview HTML is just different enough that it can't find the right parts.\r\nThen you'll have the Squiffy source you can paste back into the editor, so that you can compile/publish normally.\r\n\r\nEdit: I got it kind of working.\r\nIn your HTML file, look for the big script section, between `<script>` and `</script>` tags. There are several, but the one you want takes up 95% of the document and starts with `// Created with Squiffy 5.1.3`.\r\n\r\nThis is the part that would normally be in the file `story.js` for a published game.\r\nCopy this part of the file.\r\nWithin it, you will find the line:\r\n```\r\nvar squiffy = {};\r\n```\r\nRemove that line.\r\n\r\nTake the resulting file, and paste it into the left box on https://angelverse.mrangel.info/desquiff_noparse.html - Press go, and your Squiffy source should appear on the right.
