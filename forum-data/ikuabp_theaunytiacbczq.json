Not that good yet, and it's a lot of work too, not much different than a normal/traditional rpg game.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I've gotten used to my naming/labeling convention... and I certainly can shorten up the stuff, but I've had bad experiences with doing abrevs and shortening things up, and I know the conventions with upper and lower case, but I hate doing upper case, as it's so easy to mess them up, for me. I've just gotten used to it, and for me, it's really not that hard for me, as I've done so much harder reading comprehension/analysis, than my descriptive conventions... nothing stands out more than 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein', where EVERY single word, you got to look up in the dictionary, and even the brutal/gore'y action/battles scenes... are... 'wordy', lol</p>\n<p>also, I've changed conventions so much... it's really a pain... lol... lots of re-typing... to change old conventions of code over to new ones... lol</p>\n<p>this is what I've been using... so, I'm stuck with it for now... as I'm not interested in re-doing all of my code that I've done, lol. Not anytime soon anyways, and I probably won't until I find a really good/great convention that I like / works for me. Despite it's flaws, my descriptive convention works, thus far I've not encountered any problems with it...</p>\n\n",

A bullet travels faster/farther in the air than it does in a liquid than it does in a solid\r\n\r\n... well... I guess... a vacuum (no medium, like outerspace) would be/determine something's true/actual speed, but not everything can exist within a vacuum (no medium), as some things require a medium (matter/particles) to exist, like sound.\r\n\r\n\"Sound\" is literally air molecules bumping against each other and/or via vibrating, so no air molecules (outerspace / vacuums), no sound.\r\n\r\nthings that require a medium, are also affected by that medium (in terms of their speed through it). solids have the most resistance/friction (earth), then liquids (water), then gases (air), and lastly (but it's not a medium), a vacuum (outerspace).\r\n\r\nsending a rocket up into outerspace from east US, traveling through outerspace, and back down to west europe, is faster than taking an air-plane (and probably a jet too... I think, surely?). As the air is much more resistant than the vacuum of outerspace.\r\n\r\nit's the same with \"weight\", depending on the distance from the center of mass, you weigh more at sea level than you do on mt everest (and you weigh a ton more at the bottom of the mariana trench or the most at the center of mass itself, the earth's core), but this means that you can use human weight as the same as mass, as we're all using the same distance multiplier on our weight, as we're all at the same significant distance from the center of the earth.\r\n\r\na \"g-force\" is a comparison to your normal (human elevation/distance-from-center-of-mass-core-of-earth living) weight\r\n\r\nif I weigh normally 200 lbs, than a force of \"5 Gs\" is 1000 lbs, which, g-forces can be generated through roller coasters and fighter jets (and etc like stuff: acceleration: pos and neg). There's vertical Gs and lateral Gs, we can withstand much more vertical Gs (as its in-line with and because of having our spines-bones), than we can withstand lateral Gs. Lateral Gs make you vomit quickly, and beyond that... death, as your internal organs are slammed and crushed into/against your body, killing you.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nas to advanced physics...\r\n\r\nthere's only one way to physically go faster than the speed of light:\r\n\r\nwhen there is no space-time (when there is no physical existence), lol (the big bang/inflation)\r\n\r\nhowever, there's a way to cheat, but/thus, it's not technically/physically going faster than the speed of light:\r\n\r\nspace-time is warp'able, think of space-time (physical existence), as a rubber band, and you're on that rubber band (as an ant).\r\n\r\nimagine that the rubber band is cut, so it's a line, you're at one end of the rubber band and you want to get to the other end of the rubber band.\r\n\r\nlet's say the normal/natural length of our rubber band line is 1 foot long, and let's say it takes you as an ant, 1 minute to physically walk from one end of it to the other\r\n\r\nbut, what would happen if we were to stretch that rubber band line to 10 feet long, now how long would it take to physically walk from one end to the other? 10 minutes\r\n\r\nnow, what were to happen if we were to shorten/constrict the rubber band line, so short that the two ends are at the same place, the \"start line\" and the \"finish line\" are one and the same. how long would it take to walk from one end to the other end? 0 time: instantaneously, as you're already there, right at the beginning, as the start is the finish.\r\n\r\nsee space-time is warp'able (adjustable) just like that rubber band, so instead of physically traveling 23843984 light years... you jsut warp space-time, causing your destination to shorten/constrict/move to you, instead. You don't have to move at all, the destination comes to you.\r\n\r\nand it gets more freaky... as the \"time\" involved is actually \"time travel\" physics as well...\r\n\r\nphysical existence (space-time: distance-aka-space and time are one and the same) is really freaky, we don't understand it at all, as the more we think we understand it, the more weird and not-understood it becomes.\r\n\r\nEinstein is known for e=mc^2: matter and energy are one and the same thing, not 2 separate things\r\n\r\nBut, his greater discovery is \"space-time\": space (distance) and time are one and the same thing, not 2 separate things, as if you change space (distance) you change time, and if you change time, you change space (distance). This is shown through his \"time dilation effect\", though it's not as well known as e=mc^2\r\n\r\nspace (distance) = time\r\n\r\nlet's say that each step takes 1 second\r\n\r\nin 10 seconds, how many steps have I taken? 10 steps\r\nin 10 steps, how many seconds have passed? 10 seconds\r\n\r\nif you warp/change distance/space, you warp/change time\r\nif you warp/change time, you warp/change distance/space\r\n\r\nDimensions 1-4 are one thing (\"existence\" = distance+time), not 4 separate things\r\n(\"distance\" and \"space\" are the same words, they're the same thing, they're interchange'able, I prefer distance, but space is always used instead)\r\n(0D: point :: no distance/space)\r\n(1D: length :: line :: length :: distance)\r\n(2D: length, width :: plane :: area)\r\n(3D: length, width, height :: space/spacial :: volume)\r\n(4D: length, width, height, time :: space+time / spacial+temporal :: volume + time)\r\n\r\nspace (distance) and time, are the same thing, not separate things. \"time\" is a unit of distance, as are \"length\", \"width\", and \"height\", units of distance. \"time\" is a unit of time, as are \"length\", \"width\", and \"height\", units of time. Space (distance) and time are the same thing.\r\n\r\nas I already described space-time as being warp'able as a rubber band...\r\n\r\nnow think of it as a rubber sheet\r\n\r\nimagine dropping a heavy bowling ball onto that rubber sheet, what happens? it is stretched downwards, making a deep hole/valley/crater/whatever you want to call it, lol\r\n\r\nlet's flip it upside down, as that's a much better/familar analogy for explaining how it works:\r\n\r\nif you take a hole/valley/crater/etc and flip it upside down... you got a .... mountain, and everyone understands a mountain!\r\n\r\nthe heavier the object, the deeper hole, the bigger/taller the mountain, right? (hopefully, you're with me)\r\n\r\nif I drop a feather onto the our rubber sheet, we have no change, the flat sheet remains flat (no mountain, not even a tiny hill). The distance across it is the same as the distance around it.\r\n\r\nbut, if we were to drop a black hole onto our rubber sheet, we got a really deep hole/crater/valley/etc, and thus a really tall mountain. It'd take us a very long long long long time to walk up the mountain and back down the mountain to get to the other side, compared to walking around the super tall mountain. More time occurs traveling over the super tall mountain than in going around it. In other words... if you're on the super tall moutain, more time occurs, you've aged a lot, compared to if you're on the outside (walking around the mountain) of the mountain. The person walking around the mountain ages much less than the person walking over the mountain.\r\n\r\nif you're on the earth, you age more than a person on a space station going around the earth. Astronauts come home a few seconds (or nana seconds, as the earth really isn't that massive/dense compared to everything else, gravity is a very weak force, it requires tremendous mass/density to have significant effects, though this is very possible within the universe/outerspace, laughs) of less aging (being younger) than everyone else has aged (being older) on the earth.\r\n\r\nlink: ht.tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation\r\n\r\nso, if you orbited a black hole, you would never age...\r\n\r\nwhich is interesting, as I've never heard any thoughts on this when past the event horizon... they just talk about the physical physics involved (stretching apart into particles), but not about time/aging... as you'd become hyper-old/hyper-aging... meh, someone needs to ask theoretical physicists about what happens with time/aging... lol.\r\n\r\nIs data preserved within a black hole, or is it destroyed (via aging)... lol\r\n\r\nactually... hmm.... within the event horizon... it would be destroyed by aging... but it'd still be projected out as normal forever....\r\n\r\nand when entering the black hole, it gets preserved forever... but if its destroyed... then its not there for it to be entering the black hole... lol.\r\n\r\n(HK edit: data gets preserved forever as a projection within the event horizon, but the data gets actually destroyed by hyper-aging, and when it enters the black hole, we've no idea what happens... lol. I got confused with data preservation, for some stupid reason I said it occurs when entering the black hole too, which was incorrect. We've no idea what happens within a black hole, but the data does get preserved forever as a projection within the event horizon, despite that it actually gets destroyed by hyper-aging)\r\n\r\nokay... the projection data (from entering into past the event horizon) is preserved... but the actual data is destroyed, as the hyper-aging destroys it before it enter the black hole... hmm...\r\n\r\nfascinating....

As the air is much more resistant than the vacuum of outerspace.</p>\n<p>it's the same with \"weight\", depending on the distance from the center of mass, you weigh more at sea level than you do on mt everest (and you weigh a ton more at the bottom of the mariana trench or the most at the center of mass itself, the earth's core), but this means that you can use human weight as the same as mass, as we're all using the same distance multiplier on our weight, as we're all at the same significant distance from the center of the earth.</p>\n<p>a \"g-force\" is a comparison to your normal (human elevation/distance-from-center-of-mass-core-of-earth living) weight</p>\n<p>if I weigh normally 200 lbs, than a force of \"5 Gs\" is 1000 lbs, which, g-forces can be generated through roller coasters and fighter jets (and etc like stuff: acceleration: pos and neg). There's vertical Gs and lateral Gs, we can withstand much more vertical Gs (as its in-line with and because of having our spines-bones), than we can withstand lateral Gs. Lateral Gs make you vomit quickly, and beyond that... death, as your internal organs are slammed and crushed into/against your body, killing you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>as to advanced physics...</p>\n<p>there's only one way to physically go faster than the speed of light:</p>\n<p>when there is no space-time (when there is no physical existence), lol (the big bang/inflation)</p>\n<p>however, there's a way to cheat, but/thus, it's not technically/physically going faster than the speed of light:</p>\n<p>space-time is warp'able, think of space-time (physical existence), as a rubber band, and you're on that rubber band (as an ant).</p>\n<p>imagine that the rubber band is cut, so it's a line, you're at one end of the rubber band and you want to get to the other end of the rubber band.</p>\n<p>let's say the normal/natural length of our rubber band line is 1 foot long, and let's say it takes you as an ant, 1 minute to physically walk from one end of it to the other</p>\n<p>but, what would happen if we were to stretch that rubber band line to 10 feet long, now how long would it take to physically walk from one end to the other? 10 minutes</p>\n<p>now, what were to happen if we were to shorten/constrict the rubber band line, so short that the two ends are at the same place, the \"start line\" and the \"finish line\" are one and the same. how long would it take to walk from one end to the other end? 0 time: instantaneously, as you're already there, right at the beginning, as the start is the finish.</p>\n<p>see space-time is warp'able (adjustable) just like that rubber band, so instead of physically traveling 23843984 light years... you jsut warp space-time, causing your destination to shorten/constrict/move to you, instead. You don't have to move at all, the destination comes to you.</p>\n<p>and it gets more freaky... as the \"time\" involved is actually \"time travel\" physics as well...</p>\n<p>physical existence (space-time: distance-aka-space and time are one and the same) is really freaky, we don't understand it at all, as the more we think we understand it, the more weird and not-understood it becomes.</p>\n<p>Einstein is known for e=mc^2: matter and energy are one and the same thing, not 2 separate things</p>\n<p>But, his greater discovery is \"space-time\": space (distance) and time are one and the same thing, not 2 separate things, as if you change space (distance) you change time, and if you change time, you change space (distance). This is shown through his \"time dilation effect\", though it's not as well known as e=mc^2</p>\n<p>space (distance) = time</p>\n<p>let's say that each step takes 1 second</p>\n<p>in 10 seconds, how many steps have I taken? 10 steps<br>\nin 10 steps, how many seconds have passed? 10 seconds</p>\n<p>if you warp/change distance/space, you warp/change time<br>\nif you warp/change time, you warp/change distance/space</p>\n<p>Dimensions 1-4 are one thing (\"existence\" = distance+time), not 4 separate things<br>\n(\"distance\" and \"space\" are the same words, they're the same thing, they're interchange'able, I prefer distance, but space is always used instead)<br>\n(0D: point :: no distance/space)<br>\n(1D: length :: line :: length :: distance)<br>\n(2D: length, width :: plane :: area)<br>\n(3D: length, width, height :: space/spacial :: volume)<br>\n(4D: length, width, height, time :: space+time / spacial+temporal :: volume + time)</p>\n<p>space (distance) and time, are the same thing, not separate things. \"time\" is a unit of distance, as are \"length\", \"width\", and \"height\", units of distance. \"time\" is a unit of time, as are \"length\", \"width\", and \"height\", units of time. Space (distance) and time are the same thing.</p>\n<p>as I already described space-time as being warp'able as a rubber band...</p>\n<p>now think of it as a rubber sheet</p>\n<p>imagine dropping a heavy bowling ball onto that rubber sheet, what happens? it is stretched downwards, making a deep hole/valley/crater/whatever you want to call it, lol</p>\n<p>let's flip it upside down, as that's a much better/familar analogy for explaining how it works:</p>\n<p>if you take a hole/valley/crater/etc and flip it upside down... you got a .... mountain, and everyone understands a mountain!</p>\n<p>the heavier the object, the deeper hole, the bigger/taller the mountain, right? (hopefully, you're with me)</p>\n<p>if I drop a feather onto the our rubber sheet, we have no change, the flat sheet remains flat (no mountain, not even a tiny hill). The distance across it is the same as the distance around it.</p>\n<p>but, if we were to drop a black hole onto our rubber sheet, we got a really deep hole/crater/valley/etc, and thus a really tall mountain. It'd take us a very long long long long time to walk up the mountain and back down the mountain to get to the other side, compared to walking around the super tall mountain. More time occurs traveling over the super tall mountain than in going around it. In other words... if you're on the super tall moutain, more time occurs, you've aged a lot, compared to if you're on the outside (walking around the mountain) of the mountain. The person walking around the mountain ages much less than the person walking over the mountain.</p>\n<p>if you're on the earth, you age more than a person on a space station going around the earth. Astronauts come home a few seconds (or nana seconds, as the earth really isn't that massive/dense compared to everything else, gravity is a very weak force, it requires tremendous mass/density to have significant effects, though this is very possible within the universe/outerspace, laughs) of less aging (being younger) than everyone else has aged (being older) on the earth.</p>\n<p>link: ht.tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation</p>\n<p>so, if you orbited a black hole, you would never age...</p>\n<p>which is interesting, as I've never heard any thoughts on this when past the event horizon... they just talk about the physical physics involved (stretching apart into particles), but not about time/aging... as you'd become hyper-old/hyper-aging... meh, someone needs to ask theoretical physicists about what happens with time/aging... lol.</p>\n<p>Is data preserved within a black hole, or is it destroyed (via aging)... lol</p>\n<p>actually... hmm.... within the event horizon... it would be destroyed by aging... but it'd still be projected out as normal forever....</p>\n<p>and when entering the black hole, it gets preserved forever... but if its destroyed... then its not there for it to be entering the black hole... lol.</p>\n<p>(HK edit: data gets preserved forever as a projection within the event horizon, but the data gets actually destroyed by hyper-aging, and when it enters the black hole, we've no idea what happens... lol. I got confused with data preservation, for some stupid reason I said it occurs when entering the black hole too, which was incorrect. We've no idea what happens within a black hole, but the data does get preserved forever as a projection within the event horizon, despite that it actually gets destroyed by hyper-aging)</p>\n<p>okay... the projection data (from entering into past the event horizon) is preserved... but the actual data is destroyed, as the hyper-aging destroys it before it enter the black hole... hmm...</p>\n<p>fascinating.... HK... nerds out... lol</p>\n<hr>\n<p>HK wants our scientist's thoughts on this stuff !!!</p>\n<p>XanMag, we (err, I, anyways) want/need your expertise/knowledge on this science stuff! lol :D</p>\n\n",

We don't have anti-matter warp drives/engines yet (star trek), lol.</p>\n<p>(this is why we want to have a colony/space-ship-launching-station on the moon, as the moon's gravity is even weaker than the earth's, meaning that it's much less expensive in fuel cost to launch from the moon, as opposed from the earth)</p>\n<p>another creative idea is from Total Recall (2012) movie, in having a (or rather multiple) tunnel/elevator through the earth, lol (\"digging to china\" from the US), but of course this is completely sci-fi with our current technology, as there's so much science issues to deal with in going into the earth... lol.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>@ DarkLizard:</p>\n<p>we already have the ability to colonize mars... it can be done... lol. But, colonizing the moon first, is more important, then we can colonize mars, afterwards.</p>\n\n",
