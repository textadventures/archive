If the player progresses far enough in the game, they may have used proper fuel sources to ignite the barrel.  At this point, I added a 'fire' object to the room and used an If script to check if the fire is visible.  If so, I printed a message like \"You are in a barren field.  In the middle of the field is a metal barrel that is currently containing a very active (and hot) fire.  Else, print message \"You are in a barren field.  In the middle of the field is a metal barrel that currently contains some dry ash.\"\r\n\r\nI also have much more complicated scenarios in X3.  I used an object attribute equals script to check for the current time of day.  If object twentyfourhours has attribute equal to midnight, then I would print a message that there are no vendors currently set up in the market.  If attribute equals noon, I printed a message indicating that there are six merchants available to interact with.  If you are interested in viewing the more complicated version, let me know and I will help.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways to do this.
