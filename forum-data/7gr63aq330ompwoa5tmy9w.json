(This is just one of MANY ways to do this.)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254259-44088422-965b-11e7-922d-c7316f751a43.png)\r\n\r\nI'm making sure to give him his alias right now, and setting him up as a named character (just because I always forget these two things if I don't do them first), then we'll move on and come back to this tab later.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254275-9808e3e6-965b-11e7-9dd4-63fbb36444e2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, let's give RH something to 'carry'.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254289-be392102-965b-11e7-801a-aa4cb852dc47.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254294-d37d2d10-965b-11e7-90f0-b57993943192.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nNow, I'll add one more object, too.  Just to have more than one.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254311-f994fa8c-965b-11e7-9469-35ad5cfe892e.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow, in this example, I'm going to make my NPC a transparent container.  (You could get the same results using scope functions, but we'll keep things as simple as possible this go-round.)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254378-58d49998-965d-11e7-9ba3-3e802fc18961.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254769-97efe4f2-9662-11e7-9185-e57d74637dc7.png)\r\n\r\nNote the 'contents prefix', the 'list prefix' and all the checked (and unchecked) selections.  (These will make a BIG difference during play!)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow that we've made a person a container, we need to remove the nonsense verbs from its 'display verbs' lists:\r\n\r\nWe can't open or close RH.  (This is NOT that kind of game!)\r\n\r\n...but, by default, as soon as something is identified as a container (not a surface type, though), OPEN and CLOSE will be added to the object's verbs lists.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254434-65a9cba6-965e-11e7-8ab5-71da73e3f369.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, let's just delete them:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254438-7f89157c-965e-11e7-909c-12402fbcc4bb.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe can't take RH, so I left the 'inventory verbs' list alone.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSpeaking of not being able to take him, let's add a take message to RH.  (These games are supposed to make us laugh when we try to do silly things, after all!)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254463-ddedc5ae-965e-11e7-9d7b-caa728d652c8.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nNow, that was a warm-up exercise.\r\n\r\nNow it's time to add a script which handles what to do, depending on whether RH is carrying the objects or not.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254499-74146268-965f-11e7-98d7-3319d1cf8827.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254687-d4c642b4-9661-11e7-8769-c4d1b11ea3e4.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254536-ef645e64-965f-11e7-9f9d-d400681afeb3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  In the MoveObject line, I used 'this' as an expression.  That's a little trick you can use most of the time when a command only references one object.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI set the spoon up differently, because there IS NO SPOON.  (You've seen The Matrix, right?)\r\n\r\n---\r\nOkay, so now you can see the objects when you look at RH, and you can interact with them (although you can't take them, it will not say \"I can't see that).\r\n\r\nSo, how do we ask an NPC for something?\r\n\r\nThe EASIEST way, is to set up and ASK... ABOUT... script on the NPC.\r\n\r\nSo, first we set the game up to handle ASK/TELL:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254620-2276397a-9661-11e7-994c-c13802163039.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nThen, go to the ASK/TELL tab that now appears on the NPC, and add a topic:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254624-354790d0-9661-11e7-863b-07248bc42db5.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254982-f6180e7c-9664-11e7-9467-0695a5e9ca0a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n(NOTE: I only put 'pouch' instead of 'strange pouch'.  You will see why in a moment.)\r\n\r\nFirst, though, let's set up the response(s) for the pouch.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30255031-740b4948-9665-11e7-82c9-60fc6a9df950.png)\r\n\r\nNOTE: I did NOT use the expression 'this' in this example, because the 'strange pouch' is not a known object when the player enters a command like this.  The \"pouch\" is read as text, not an object.  (In fact, to be safe, just use the object's name as much as possible, and disregard my earlier tip about using 'this'.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nFinally, since we can ask him about things now, we'll set up a couple more topics. \r\n\r\nI won't bore you with the example for the spoon, but you may find this one interesting:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254803-1fa167d6-9663-11e7-86cd-cea24a39f1c6.png)\r\n\r\nNow, if the player asks about something that includes 'game', 'author', or 'story', this response will be printed.\r\n\r\n...and lastly, we add a response for when the player asks something we haven't set up (again, just for fun).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254846-9248c9fa-9663-11e7-9d88-a896466109dd.png)\r\n\r\nNOTE:  You work TELL the same way, but this thread is about making things visible.  (The rest of this post MAY be sort of off-topic. but not technically.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nOkay, let's see how the game plays now!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhoops!\r\n\r\nForgot to set up the \"Speak to\" verb!  (Just for completion's sake.  If the player can't TALK TO him, they may not try to ask him anything.)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254889-e7c803dc-9663-11e7-85a7-c02ae979b0e5.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30254905-1142b7a2-9664-11e7-91cb-8aaf80c881bb.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nOkay, now let's see it in action:\r\n\r\n\r\n[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/30255157-e64e4194-9666-11e7-96c1-425ff56d08d3.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzGPNwPjOx3TaTRDUngyT19aNGc/view?usp=sharing \"Watch the example in action at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzGPNwPjOx3TaTRDUngyT19aNGc/view?usp=sharing\")\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nNOTE:  I still missed important, little things.
