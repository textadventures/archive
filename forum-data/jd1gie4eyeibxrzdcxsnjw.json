I had always wanted to make a gamebook, so I figured this would be a good opportunity! \r\n\r\nThe game is made in Quest, but was too large to upload to their website due to being fully narrated. If you want to give it a go, make sure you have their desktop version installed first! Don't worry, it's free as well.\r\n\r\n(I'm not certain if this forum is only for games that have been uploaded on the website, or just any old game announcements.
