Open it in a text editor and find the line that says\n[code:2zoyv8y1]socket = io&#46;listen(8000);[/code:2zoyv8y1]\n8000 is the default port the server will be run on. Feel free to change it, just remember that your router will need to be port forwarded to whatever port you choose!

This is used so that after &quot;Login&quot; is called, the server can send back a confirmation to start the game. The parameter &quot;empty&quot; will always be an empty string, and is only there to act as a fake parameter to get around the JavaScript function ASLEvent limitations (You MUST specify ONE Quest function and ONE parameter).\n\nIf you have any errors or questions, post them here and I'll do my best to answer them.",

      "EditableText": "This is a nifty feature if it works and would make a great addition to Quest, opening up many more possibilities for it and the community in general.  However, I am sure it takes more than a simple port to make a MUD type game.  How would one go about making a game online for multiple users to begin with?  I am not too worried about the room or monster/equipment/item balancing, but making more than one player to be able to be in the game at a time.  Would it be as simple as creating &quot;player&quot;, &quot;player1&quot;, &quot;player2&quot;, &quot;player150&quot; or what?  Also are these WebSocket-based servers free to use?",
