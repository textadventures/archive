I'm trying to understand the situation. I had toyed with the idea of using a base type for an object to hold all the common attributes, and then have &quot;proxy&quot; or &quot;instance&quot; objects in each room where the object shows up. That way, you can put all the details (description, etc) in the type and then basically just have a simple derived object to occupy each room. Can I assume this is scenery?",
