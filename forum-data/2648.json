      "EditableText": "Thanks Alex. \n\nCan I just say first of all what a genius piece of work Quest is. When I was younger playing on a Spectrum 48K (you probably can't remember it) I used to love text adventure and tried to program in Basic to create one, never quite mastering it. Now I have the ability to combine two ambitions; creative writing and making my own interactive game. Thanks again.\n\nAnyway, that sounds easy and I guess if it is not a &quot;lockable&quot; door (in the game from the player's perspective) I can change the default messages from &quot;It is locked/unlocked&quot; (or whatever, etc) to &quot;the door is shut/open&quot;? Otherwise a simple open/close door would seem like you needed a key?\n\nI'll get back on here with the (inevitable) further problems.\n\nCheers",
