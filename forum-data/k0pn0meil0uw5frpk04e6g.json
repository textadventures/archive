      "EditableText": "Hello all :) \r\n\r\nSo I have a menu which is my character creator. I'd like to add a \"back\" choice to it which will recall the previous menu choices but I'm not sure how to do that logically. For example, this is the code for advancing to the next menu options...\r\n```\r\nlist remove (game.ccreation, \"Parent History\")\r\nlist add (game.ccreation, \"Family Reputation\")\r\nClearScreen\r\nCharacterCreation1\r\n```\r\nSo would I do something like this if someone hit the \"back\" choice?\r\n```\r\nlist remove (game.ccreation, \"Parent History\")\r\nlist add (game.ccreation, \"Stats\")\r\nClearScreen\r\nCharacterCreation1\r\n```\r\n((Stats is the previous menu))\r\n\r\nOr would that cause an error?\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nThis is how you do it :) There was no immediate error that I noticed right off the bat. I'll update this, if it does happen.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Turns out if you have stat increases per choice then the game will stack them I think. I didn't take that into account. But if all your stats happen at the end of the creation process, I don't see this method being a problem. \r\n\r\nAnonynn. ",
