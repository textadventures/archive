However, I don't know how to make my weapons functional or set a combat system. I don't want strength, speed, etc. attributes, just a simple level-based system. I found the corecombat library, but I don't know how to look at what is in the library to know what is in it for me to use. Is there a way to see what functions and whatnot are in a library?",
