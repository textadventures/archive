Maybe at some point if I get a carreer and got the money, I'll buy the RPG-Maker engine, so I can make those old-school RPGs... though I can't do graphics... which is a big problem, lol. Except I'll likely be too old ~ too late, sighs. And I'm just struggling with basic programming, hopefully I can keep progressing, sighs. I'm just not that smart, as I wish I was, everyone else seems to get programming so easily, and it's not just because they've been doing it longer, they're just so much smarter than me, or I'm just so much dumber than everyone else, sighs)\n\nI like Text Adventures (well Quest specifically), because it's the only thing I can do, towards making an RPG, laughs.

When you're playing a big game, you spend longer waiting for the commands to be processed than you do actually playing the game.\n\n&gt; Crashes. My browser crashes very rarely but I've found when playing online games, it had a tendency to crash all the time. And when it crashes, I lose whatever progress I've made on the game and have to start again. I can't remember the last time a game I've downloaded and played offline crashed and lost my progress.\n\n&gt; Missing features: I haven't played that many games online but the ones I've tried always seem to miss features that are present if you download them. No changing of font sizes or styles, colours are fixed and sound and graphics often don't work properly.\n\n&gt; The delete button: a few times I've pressed the delete button to correct a mistake and the browser has taken me right out of the game and to the previous website I was on, thus losing all my progress along the way.\n\n&gt; Save game positions: one time I saved a game I was playing online then when I played it again a few days later, it asked me to name my saves game position. I couldn't remember so I was forced to start again. On a downloaded game, even if I couldn't remember the name, I could still find the saved game because it'd be in the same location as the game file.\n\nSo for me if I have a choice between downloading a game and playing it online, I'll download it every time.
