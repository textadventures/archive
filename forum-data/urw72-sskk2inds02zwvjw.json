      "EditableText": "Hey everybody! I'm developing a text adventure called \"The Lunch Lady Returns\" based on a creepypasta I submitted to creepypasta.org a few years ago. It's a horror/black comedy-style survival game about a group of students in detention who have to escape a murderous member of the kitchen staff at their school. The creepypasta itself got pretty popular on youtube (Creeps McPasta read it in a video that has over one million views) so I thought it would be fun to give the story an update and release it in a new medium. I will also be entering the title into this year's IFComp, which takes place starting in October.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty new to this site and to the IF community in general, so I could really use some feedback on this project. If you're interested in testing out the game, feel free to shoot me an email at seabasswashere@gmail.com and I'll respond with a link to an unlisted version.",
