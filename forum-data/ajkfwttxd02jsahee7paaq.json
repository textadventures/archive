Whatever enemies the player will encounter have zero relation to the dragon of atlantis, whatever, if it have no relation, at least let it be fun, so currently it is not fun as well unless you like killing random people.</p>\n<p>I understand your 2 thoughts, however I am stuck at filling in the details and writing the story line, my brain is kinda attuned to real life, humans and logic. I remembered when I was young, I make stickman games based on clock monster, skateboard time traveller and aliens in suit, all these imagination is now gone. And if you think Dragon of atlantis is a not bad idea, it is stolen from my teenager self-written story as well...</p>\n\n",
