Basically create objects and use if statements to see if they exist or not, and that will affect either the amount of choices the players have in a given moment, or the results of events.  \n\nI wanted to know how is it possible to do while avoiding code view (which to me is a bit of a maze). Maybe I missed the tutorial about it?\n\n\n\n\nEdit:\nOK, I think I see how it works. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I see that I can use the if statement to check if an object exist, but how can I create the object to begin with?\n\n{if (GetObject(mummy)==true \n  {\n   {page:Page5}\n  }\n else\n {\npage:Page4\n }\nflag:}",
