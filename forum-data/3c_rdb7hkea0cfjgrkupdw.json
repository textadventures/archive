      "EditableText": "I had an idea where if the player did the exact same run a few times that the game would see this(by counting) and would then change it up a bit.\r\n\r\nIn the example lets say the player only plays three rooms and then dies. The actions that got him there was \r\n\r\nfight, run, left, fight, fight, death, restart. He does this several time. In most cases players would try another approach to see if they could get a more favorable ending, but what if they tried it say 5 times in a row? We could then surprise the player and change the last screen to something else and make it so the player found a secret ending or a new way around the issue. \r\n\r\nIn the example above the player died at that spot and the game asked if they would like to restart. Instead of having them restart, it then says. continue. Maybe someone came by and patched him/her up and the adventure continues, or maybe he becomes the thing that killed him, like a vampire, zombie, or werewolf. \r\n\r\nI believe this would add new life to a game that at first seems completely scripted, which it still is, but having the player think they found out something new that others have not. This in turn makes them want to explore other options, see the game under a new light. Check every option to see if there are other gems hiding under each link.\r\n\r\nI have an ambitious project I am working on and these kind of ideas are driving me to make something beyond the traditional text adventure game. my goal is to expand the genre and make something along the lines of a STAG, (strategy text adventure game) I want there to be things that feel common with the majority of the text adventure games. But I also want to add probabilities, and means to increase chances and make it so the player is aware of there surroundings. I am building a text based battle system right now in the hopes to make the game feel more alive to the player to make them feel that there choices are unique each play threw.  \r\n\r\nbesides loop counting I was also thinking about action counting, as in how many links they clicked. you could make a time system and make it so to complete certain tasks you have to do it during certain in game house. a javascript should be able to handle that. We could say every click is 5 minutes and that to say, go to the bakery, you need to be there between 10am to 6pm.\r\n\r\nI think loop counting and action counting is a start. has anyone else tried these in there works?
