Also at the start of the adventure commands like Dry Yourself should not be displayed until the player is wet from swimming. \nSo far the only way has been to replace an object with another object and display it with the name. For example replace the dry ball object with a wet ball object (using invisible and visible options) and add the command Dry Ball to the Wet Ball and display it with the same name of Ball.\nBut I'm hoping that there is a better way to do this.\n\nBrian123",
