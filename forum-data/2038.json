      "EditableText": "Hey there,\n\nI'm new on this forum, and the search function doesn't seem to help me (I get lots and lots of results, but it's hard to find a helpful comment in that mess), so I'm very sorry if my questions have already been answered somewhere (please don't eat me!  <!-- s:cry: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Crying or Very sad\" /><!-- s:cry: -->  ). I need help with the following:\n1) How do I set a type for an object? I found the function to [i:1tlwib7n]create[/i:1tlwib7n] types (in my case, the types are &quot;day&quot; and &quot;night&quot;), but I can't find a function to set them up or change them. I didn't see it in &quot;variables&quot;, where the flags are, and the other function bars didn't look useful either. \n\n2) I don't know if this is possible, but I would like to make one object temporarily disappear if another certain object is used on it. (For an example, let's say it this way: &quot;Use water on candle&quot; -&gt; flame disappears -&gt; flame can not be seen or interacted with for 10 seconds -&gt; flame returns.) Is there a chance to do that, and if so, can you tell me how it's done? (I also would need detailed instructions for how to create a timer of that kind.)\n\n3) How do I insert pictures? I tried an imageshack link as well as the name of the picture (it's saved under &quot;My Documents&quot;, but since I didn't know how to direct to them, I just typed in the pic name, as in &quot;picture.jpeg&quot;.\n\nPlease help me!  <!-- s:oops: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /><!-- s:oops: -->",
