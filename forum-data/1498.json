I now have completed the entire main story, with the all the puzzles, differant solutions, and multiple endings.  It plays through great and bug free (and it only took 10 months of hard work to make.)\n\nAll I have to do now is put in all the filler (look at the carpet, eat the paint off the wall, etc) that makes these games fun and I will be ready for testing and release.  Hopefully in a couple more months I'll be finally finished (though I have yet to name the darn thing).\n\nMy goal is to have it done in one year, so I am going to keep at it.  I hope all of your projects are coming along just as well.\n\nHappy Holidays,\nDr. Froth",
