I have many others and get stuck so I give up but this one is different being the firsttime I have asked the public what they think. Now this game will consist of many objects o craft such as weapons, tools and more, you will be able to upgrade your base frame by frame, cook food and so on. So far only worked on for about 4 hours mind you I know no coding so its not extravagant (YET) but more is coming just want opinion on system so far and where I should take it  and how? Mind also their are some bugs with volume amount trying to hash it out hope you enjoy.",

That release was an older one I have updated most of the rock1,2 and woods mostly. My goal was to paint the image after I hashed out the main mechanics of the crafting, like now you can hunt, trap and fish also make campfires to stay warm etc. The sharp stone is for making a stone axe and campfire for most part but to make stone axe you need to craft plant fibers from grass and sticks from bushes. If still interested in newer version for some more criticism I will defiantly  update my post. Thank you for your insight. Also your goal is to survive, there is a day cycle and meters to the left side of screen. These meters tell you what you need to worry about (IE: Exposer means you need to build a campfire or a shelter where as thirst you need water and hunger is food. So far you can drink from a pond, set traps for deer and rabbit, craft knife to skin and gut them and the campfire to cook the meats) Key is to make a stone axe so you can mine boulders and chop down trees. Once trees and chopped chop up the fallen tree to get tree trucks, collect them and craft planks. You can craft planks into 3 items, a menu will popup wit what you can craft.",

So Ill see what might be the problem and put up a fix when I find it. There are 3 walk throughs that are just text so you must read them, to make sticks hit a bush 3 times and a stick will appear in room, grass hit 2 times pick up and craft into plant fibers do that 3 times so you have 3 plant fibers. From there you can craft the fibers into rope; Then take your stick and combine to make a handle, now combine handle with rope for a mancatcher. Once the mancatcher is made you can now craft a rock into a sharp stone then craft sharp stone with the mancatcher to get a stone axe. Once you have the stone axe every thing become possible lol. Let me know if your still having problems im gonna download on a different pc to see if it works like it does on my main pc. Thanks again will be updating often and adding more, when I put a lot I will put in a change log.",

I am slowly putting more in descriptions and making alot of them say random stuff so the same message doesn't display over and over. So i will get to work and clear that mess up and add in some text when you take a action this way it will give you more then just sound. Thats honestly why I didn't put a whole lot in yet was because of the sounds but playing though myself i got the same feeling. I do have a text walktrough that just tells you how to make a few certain things but i will make a intro along with more description to start with, fornow though the messages may only be one line to start with. My plan is to have most description have a random output so it changes also. \nNow aside from those issues how did it play? Was it smoother, less hiccups? Did you get a chance to craft  tent or campfire maybe a storage chest? Sorry got really excited when i got those itemsu working and added to campfire ohh also the box trap really cool stuff im working with but yes i agree it  a text game and needs more so i will be making sure the itwm don't tell amount you have until picked up <!-- s:-) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:-) --> \nThank you again so much makes making a game more worth it hearing that someone has played itlol",

I could click on any link given for craft and combine without issue. So yes - much better and smoother. \nTwo more hiccups - I know you are still going to add descriptions but:\nI am unable to tell you where this bush was; since it only states that I am in some woods - it did not give me any sticks and I desperately needed some.\n\nSo my tip to you again. For all your objects, create an object type with all the  scripts for that object already on that object type and then you only need to inherit the object type to the actual object and that object will behave the same every time. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

I think you'll really like for I have gave hints in descriptions now not all but main parts have random images for the pond if you see fish or not. Man im excited and thanks again for playing can't wait to get this up so you can see it.\nAlso not sure what problem with sticks your having but as of now its set up to just add more sticks to your inventory and print you crafted more sticks or if you destroy another bush you automatically pick them up. If you have sticks click look at and it will tell you amount. Oh another thing most of the wording will be cleared up.",
