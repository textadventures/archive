The way to edit this is quite complicated, but, tracing the text back, you can see that to do this, you need to take the following steps:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n**1 -** In the panel on the left-hand side, at the bottom, there should be a button saying \"filters\". Click that, and then click \"Show library Elements\".\r\n\r\n**2 -** Search for \"Conjugate\", and then click \"Copy\" at the top, in the yellow panel.\r\n\r\n**3 -** From here, go into code view of conjugate(at the top of the block script - looks like this: < / > ). \r\n\r\n**4 -** Now, replace this part of the code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n        return (Mid(verb, 1, Lengthof(verb) - 1) + \"ies\")\r\n```\r\nWith:\r\n```        if (verb = \"say\") {\r\n          return (Mid(verb, 1, Lengthof(verb)) + \"s\")\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n          return (Mid(verb, 1, Lengthof(verb) - 1) + \"ies\")\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<br>\r\nThis should cause \"He/She/It saies nothing\" to become \"He/She/It says nothing\".\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",

The correct implementation would be to exclude -uy, -oy, or -ay.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole bunch of words that it will get wrong; but \"saies\" is the one that people always comment on, because it is used in a default message.\r\nA while back I wrote a new version of the `Conjugate` function which puts all the endings in a dictionary, allowing more to be easily added it if a game needs them; maybe it'll make it into the core library if Quest gets another bugfix update.",
