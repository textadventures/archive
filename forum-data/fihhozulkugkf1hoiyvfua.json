I just released [a little RPG](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ufy2pfd8skwhy_q5htclia/keep-of-the-mad-wizard), essentially a gamebook like in the old days, except it rolls the dice for you and has randomized elements, so you can't rely on memorization to win. The wonders of Twine! I don't know what to tell you that's not mentioned on the game page or in the game proper, so enjoy, and let me know what you think. And of course I'd be happy to answer questions.",
