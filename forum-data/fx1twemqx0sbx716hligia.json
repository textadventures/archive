      "EditableText": "I think there are two ways to do this:\r\n\r\n1.  Use a command.\r\nA.  I added a command in the room where the pond and fish were.\r\nB.  I typed this in the command box:  **use net on fish; use the net on the fish; use the net on fish; catch fish with net; get fish with net; grab fish with net; take fish with net; catch fish using net; get fish using net; grab fish using net; take fish using net**\r\nC.  I added an 'IF' script here to check if the player was carrying the net and if the player was, then I added a first time script that printed a message indicating a fish was caught, making fish1 visible, and added it to the inventory.\r\nD.  In the otherwise part of this script, I placed a print message script indicating that \"You have already caught one fish.  There is no need to take another.\"\r\nE.  In the inventory tab of the fish, I added an 'If' script that checked if the player was carrying the net and if the player was, I added a print message script saying \"That's a great idea, but maybe you should try catching a fish using that fancy fish net you are carrying.\"  In the else box here, I added a snarky comment like \"You try your best grizzly bear impression but you cannot catch the fish with your mouth or your \"bear\" hands.\"\r\n\r\n2.  Place an 'If' script in the inventory tab for the fish in the pond.\r\nA.  Essentially do part E above, but instead of making a comment about using the net, just make fish1 visible and add it to the inventory.  That way, 'get fish' will catch a fish if the player is carrying the net.\r\n\r\nThe problem with using either of the above is that you now have two objects by the same name.  This will lead to the annoying 'Please choose which 'fish' you mean:' default when trying to catch or take a fish a second time (once your caught fish becomes visible).  The work-around here I use is that I name it something slightly different than 'fish' when it is caught.  When successfully catching the fish, I might make a comment like \"You haul the fish in with your net and upon closer inspection, you find out that you have caught yourself a trout!\"  The fish you have now caught becomes trout instead of fish.  \r\n\r\nI am sure there are other ways, but this is how I deal with this.",
