(it is MS Windows - what did you expect?  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /><!-- s:shock: -->  )\n\nCertain versions of Windows (e.g. NT) don't support the standard 'autorun.inf' shelling to the associated program because (without gettng too technical) the required command isn't 'built in' to the OS.  What you need to do is run a self-contained exe from the CD which can identify what the file associations are and start the user's associated program, passing it the selected file to open.\n\nI use a tiny utility program called 'shelexec' which is easy to use and works a treat with every windows PC I've tried it on so far.  If you want to, e-mail me and I'll send you a copy and instructions for how to use it with your choice of files - it is [b:3u95050w]very[/b:3u95050w] simple.\n\nAl (MaDbRiT)",
