The exits all seem accurate, and the error actually does not just send the yellow dot into the wrong room, but further travels into a dozen or so other rooms without my touching the arrow or doing anything else, creating a long tangled line of new direction exits. The game start script moves the character from one room to another about 16 rooms, but shouldn't wake up again after running in the level 1 game start, so it can't be that. I also have three entering rooms scripts, one for player, one for player object 2, and one for player object 3. They all create a random integer that changes the colour of each room on that level, but it looks clean to me. The exits, I have checked them and checked them, they look right.\r\nI haven't already mass-generated rooms, but I can't see how that wouldn't be less complicated than doing them by hand. However, how was making them by hand, and adding basic scripts, complicated? That, I don't quite know. It isn't like I have a deadline. I'll figure it out eventually, I think.",
