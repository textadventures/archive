Daisy, for example, has misconstrued my decryption of a post of hers which referenced an association between the term &quot;sycophant&quot; and how it sounds like an STD, and how she liked that (maybe a mistype).  I posted, simply as a scientific rendering, that she finds STDs likeable because her name is DAISY/AIDSy.  This was not an insult, but rather an emotionally disconnected observation; I was not equating Daisy as a person with the worth of STDs.  I meant it as... DAISY DIS? AY!
