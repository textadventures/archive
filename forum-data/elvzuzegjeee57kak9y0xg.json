I have tried ticking the prefix box, unticking it, changing the name of the room... When you enter the room or 'l', I get this:  You are in a village outskirts or you are in the village outskirts (if I change the prefix to the).\r\n\r\nHow can I get rid of 'in' and replace it with 'at' for this one room?  I want it to read 'You are at the village outskirts.'\r\n\r\nThanks.",
