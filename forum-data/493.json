Funny thing is I hadn't been doing any coding, testing or any other running of Quest/QDK/Questnet within atleast 12 hours, but still I hadn't restarted lately.\n\nQuestnet has been keeping itself in my system processes on more than one occassion. It will begin using up tons of cpu sometimes, but others I don't even notice it. Sometimes multiple instances of it can be found running in my system processes. Don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but I've had it happen 2-5 different times through both 3.5 and 3.52 builds.\n\nI'll try and replicate it a little later and show you some screenshots to better explain. You might want to look into this though Alex.",
