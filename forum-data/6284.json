      "EditableText": "Doesn't matter, it will still be fine (assuming I am right about how Quest works, anyway).\n\nThe way I think it works is that Quest keeps a database where each object/room is a record. The order of those records is the order they appear in your game file. When the player picks things up, that is just changing a field for that record (i.e., the &quot;parent&quot; attribute), it does not change where that record is stored in the database. So when Quest does the inventory it goes through each record, picking out those for which the parent attribute is player, and adding them to the list. If your backpack is the last record (whereever it is in the game world), it will get added to the inventory list last, so will appear at the bottom.\n\nSo your backpack will only be in the special storage room right at the very start to ensure it is the last record in the database, then moved into the game by the start script. After that, you just handle it as normal; if dropped it goes into the current room, because that will only change the parent attribute, not its place in the database.\n\nAs I type this, I realise there is a flaw, however. Any items created during the game, for example anything cloned, will get added to the database, so will presumably appear after the backpack. It might be better to put the storage room at the top so the backpack is always top of the list.\n\nBy the way, on the Object tab there is an option to give things a special name for something in the lists on the right, so you could flag storage items with an asterisk or something.",
