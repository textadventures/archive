I'd be back in a heartbeat if they launched a classic server but the current one just holds no appeal for me.\n\nOther than that, I've played quite a few MMOs over the years - Lord of the Rings and Rift being my favourite - and I'm currently having a blast in Diablo 3. I've also played the GTA games, though I haven't got into GTA 5 yet.",
