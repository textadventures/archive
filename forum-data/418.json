In fact, now that I look back, it was not even good by novice standards. In fact, I downloaded and replayed it and only half of it worked. It was short and uninspired. Now I have decided to come back and try again...some four years later. :) Anyway, I will start jabbing off now. Here is my question. I have started work on a sort of character creation system that I want to use for a quest game, or maybe more than one. Right now all you can do is choose is answer a few questions that will determine what your character looks like; such as name, age, race, sex, hair color/style, eye color/style, face expression, title, etc. I would like to know if there is a better way I can make this system work than how I have it now.
