Because I am completely worthless at coding I believed and correctly that this program would be more simple and what I wanted than all the other programs. I am writing a game *cough cough* and would like your advice on certain concepts I do not think I can grasp easily.\n\n1. I have replaced the regular health stat with a modified value called Stamina, and have an additional value called Mana for magic. Now in the course of the game, the values will drop up and down. However I wish to set a maximum value for these two statuses because I don't wish to cheapen the value of healing in the game.  Here is the example of the code I used to set these values in the first place [code:1r77rost]&lt;Stamina type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/Stamina&gt;\n      &lt;Mana type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/Mana&gt;\n player&#46;Stamina = player&#46;Warrior+6\n          player&#46;Mana = player&#46;Mage * 2[/code:1r77rost] So how would I set a maximum value for these two, and if there are events in the game that can change these values how I do I code for this circumstance?\n\n2.Next I have set a menu based system for selecting the player character's race and class.

There are lots of ways you can tackle this. You could simply have one potion that gets reused throughout the game, and could simulate multiple potions by giving it a &quot;uses&quot; attribute that increments by 1 every time you &quot;pick up&quot; a health potion, and subtracts 1 every time it's used and then move out of the player's inventory when it's all used up. \n\nOr you could create a &quot;master&quot; healing potion item and clone it wherever you want to have the player be able to pick it up, and remove them from the player's inventory when they've been used up. \n\nThose are just a couple of examples. I'm sure there are other ways this could be addressed as well. Hope that helps!",

Do objects that are of a nature to be used vanish from the inventory automatically or do I need to code for this event?</blockquote><br/><br/>Put the object wherever you'd like the player to get it. There are lots of ways you can tackle this. You could simply have one potion that gets reused throughout the game, and could simulate multiple potions by giving it a &quot;uses&quot; attribute that increments by 1 every time you &quot;pick up&quot; a health potion, and subtracts 1 every time it's used and then move out of the player's inventory when it's all used up. <br/><br/>Or you could create a &quot;master&quot; healing potion item and clone it wherever you want to have the player be able to pick it up, and remove them from the player's inventory when they've been used up. <br/><br/>Those are just a couple of examples. I'm sure there are other ways this could be addressed as well. Hope that helps!",
