      "EditableText": "> Or you could just download the game, paste it in and see what happens.\r\n\r\nI don't have a Windows PC, so I can only use the web version of Quest. So, can't open someone else's game for editing.\r\n\r\n> See here.\r\n\r\nThat screenshot shows the lines:\r\n<pre><code>Tackle.critdesc = \"#Attacker# tackles the \" + <b style=\"color: red\">=</b>player.equipped.name\r\n+ \" and hits hard (#hits# hits)!\"</code></pre>\r\n\r\nTwo errors there:\r\n* The `{=` construct allows you to put an expression inside a string. You use it instead of `\" +`. This is already an expression, so the `\" + =` just confuses it.\r\n* You've got a line break in the middle of the expression\r\n\r\nThose lines should be:\r\n<pre><code style=\"color: green\">Tackle.critdesc = \"#Attacker# tackles the {=player.equipped.name} and hits hard (#hits# hits)!\"</code></pre>\r\nor\r\n<pre><code style=\"color: green\">Tackle.critdesc = \"#Attacker# tackles the {=GetDisplayAlias(player.equipped)} and hits hard (#hits# hits)!\"</code></pre>\r\n\r\nLater in the same code you have:\r\n`Tackle.missdesc = \"#Attacker# tackles \" + GetDisplayAlias(player.equipped.name) + \" but entirely misses.\"`\r\n\r\nTwo problems here as well:\r\n\r\n* There are two ways to turn an object into a name. You could use <code style=\"color: green\">GetDisplayAlias (player.equipped)</code> (which is good), or you could use <code style=\"color: orange\">player.equipped.name</code> (which is less good). You appear to be using both, so you're asking Quest to get the name of the name of the object.\r\n* It looks up what object is in `player.equipped` once, when the start script runs, and sets missdesc to use that name permanently.
