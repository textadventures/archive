Is there a set order to how a library is laid out: i.e. functions, commands, interface, etc.\r\n2. The use of templates:\r\nIf an interface tab has been created for the library and checkboxes are in use, should the caption be written on the tab or a template used instead.\r\nShould a template be also used in commands or verbs of the library, as opposed to having a message written in the command or verb itself.\r\n(I hope that makes sense)\r\n\r\nI know the above is probably up to the creator themselves, but just wondering what best practice might be.\r\n",
