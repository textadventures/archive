Make sure no errors get thrown up , test all possible routes and actions, check for typos and bad grammar, and while you go along, if you think you can make a description sound better, do so.\r\n\r\nAlso seek out the really good TA (they're very few and far between) and study their construction.\r\n\r\nHere's one for a starter. You need to download it, but it's worth it. Forget the interface and just study the game itself, the descriptions, the responses, etc etc.\r\n\r\nThe only (slight) irritation with this game is waiting for the text to display, as it uses a 'typewriter' effect which is rather slow. I think if you set the graphics to low at the start, it may run faster, but I went for max and haven't tried it on low yet.\r\n\r\nhttps://jonnocode.itch.io/the-house-abandon\r\n\r\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/PYx-sSdCSz8",
