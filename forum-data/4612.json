And that should be with every room. Now if the player for example reads a Nietzsche quote or something, the likelihood of becoming the weird room when the player enters the next room should then be 2%. And then when the player reads another quote or something the chance should rise again, to 3% and so on. \nIs that possible with quest? And how?\nAny ideas?",
