      "EditableText": "I think it would be fair to say that a good portion of IFs designed by non-professionals (if such a profession exists) are very often difficult to complete, not because of good deign, but because of poor design.\n\nI certainly do not exclude myself from this group, and am constantly coming across areas of my WIP that need 'fixing', not because the mechanics don't work, but because they're simply illogical or set unclear objectives.\n\nThe toughest part, of course, is trying to look at your game world as though you've never seen it before - as a prospective player would - when in fact you've seen every location and object a thousand times over. You the designer, [i:b47g4lt8]know[/i:b47g4lt8] that you must visit the wizard in order to get the portion to kill the witch, but will your player? The trick therefore, is finding the balance between 'tricky' and just plain confusing... easier said that done.\n\nTo make the game difficult, you must force your player to think logically, in order to overcome the stumbling blocks, and then reward them when they do. Having them run around like a headless chicken because all their logical inputs fail to produce the desire result (because the actual solution is [i:b47g4lt8]illogical[/i:b47g4lt8]) is the quickest way to lose a player.\n\nBut no one sets out to make a solution illogical (unless they're silly), and it could just be that their thought process was on a completely different path when creating the puzzle. What may have seemed perfectly logical to them when creating the game, may well be the last thing a player may consider to be the answer. A perfect example of this was when I uploaded a section from my own game for beta testing. The 'solution' was to 'shoot the goon', but this never occurred to one of the testers, and on reflection he was perfectly right. Whether it was a lack of info in the narrative, or a failing to make the player's objectives clear, I failed to spot it.\n\nAnd yes, you can say this is what beta testers are for, but these illogical games still get through and I think it would be useful for others to offer their opinions on the topic.",

      "EditableText": "I think you guys are over-thinking this. IF games can give the illusion of a huge world with endless possibilities, but in reality the player has a limited number of rooms and objects and NPCs to interact with. Unless the player has the attention span of a gnat, or the game is so poorly written and buggy it's not worth spending time on, they're going to examine and try the obvious interactions with everything. In the OP example 'visit the wizard to get the potion to kill the witch', that wizard will eventually get visited just in the natural course of exploring, and if the witch is a major obstacle of the game the player will likely ask the wizard about her. Or about his potions, if the author has bothered to get across the fact that he makes them.  \n\nThough I'd say it would make me more confidant that the author knew what they were doing as far as game design if it were clued in [i:2s8vh13c]some[/i:2s8vh13c] way that the player should visit the wizard--not one delivered with a sledgehammer since those are just obnoxious, but something more subtle in a way that doesn't clash with the rest of the writing. Maybe it's well known that the wizard is the only other magic using potion-maker in the area and that he and the witch don't get along. If the character doesn't start off knowing this themselves, there's a thousand different ways to deliver that information that aren't literally just print message 'HMM I WONDER IF I SHOULD GET A POTION FROM THE WIZARD IN THE FOREST'.    \n\nThough of course if you're expecting the player to do something pretty far outside of the usual things they expect to encounter in an IF game, a little more obvious hints as to the actual verbs needed might be necessary. \n\nAnd Silver's example was a good one. Normally I might not pay attention to a wall my first time through a room, but the ivy draws attention to it. I wouldn't necessarily think to [i:2s8vh13c]climb[/i:2s8vh13c] the wall right away, but I'd definitely examine either it or the ivy, and both descriptions could easily talk about how uneven the wall is, with cobblestones jutting out here and there, or about how the thick ivy looks strong enough to hold your weight.",
