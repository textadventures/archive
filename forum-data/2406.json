I want the player to be able to shoot the person they're playing as with a gun. It's sort of like a mean easter egg in my game. I didn't know how to do that but I thought I'd make a object called self, and if you shot self with the object gun you'd lose. My problem is that self has to either be in the inventory or the same room for this to work and I think it'd be tacky to make the player have to pick up self. Is there some way to make self by default  in the inventory? Or is there some other way to kill the player like such. <!-- s:?: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_question.gif\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\" /><!-- s:?: -->  <!-- s:?: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_question.gif\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\" /><!-- s:?: -->  <!-- s:?: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_question.gif\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\" /><!-- s:?: --> \n\nThanks for you time\n\nMatt.\n <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
