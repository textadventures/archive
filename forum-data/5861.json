However I've had reports that it soon slows down unacceptably in online play. Even in local play it slows down. However this appears to be largely because of the mapping: it seems that when the map shown is very large and complex things start slowing down a lot (plus some map artefacts appear). But it is still perfectly playable on my machine, though others have had difficulties and had to clear the map.",
