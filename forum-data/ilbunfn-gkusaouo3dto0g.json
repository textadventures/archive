After writing three pages concerning the past five years, and thinking about all the people I know who ate it all up like candy, I got discouraged. This is because I realized anything I wrote wouldn't help because (A) most of the people I know who believe the obvious lies either don't or can't read, and (B) I realized it's all about supply and demand.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did realize that might help everyone out a little is that we all pay the cable news people's salaries. All those news channels are included in the basic subscription package. So, everyone with cable, satellite, or what-have-you is supporting this crap.\r\n\r\nI am no longer a customer. If they take the news channels out of the basic programming packages, making it so anyone who wants those news channels have to pay extra to add them to their own plan, I will subscribe to their programming again. Until then, the cable and satellite programming providers are just as bad as whatever cable news network you hate, as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\n(They can call that \"cancel culture\", or they can call it an example of \"free market capitalism\"; I don't really give a shit.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n> Hope to see you back on this unpolitical website\r\n\r\nOf the few times politics have been discussed on this site, I think I am responsible for 90% of them.

This is funny, because I do my best to avoid making declarative statements with no evidence to back them up, and I don't like anyone who has ever been in office, nor do I like anyone who is (or was) running for office.\r\n\r\nI tried to be polite and respectful while attempting to apply the Golden Rule, as I would want someone to let me know if I believed things which were obviously untrue, but I really just don't care anymore. If someone brings up anything political, I will politely attempt to change the subject. If that fails, I will humbly request that we avoid discussing such things. If that fails, I shall avoid that person henceforth.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWithin a week, I will no longer know which politician is the Babyface and which politician is the Heel.\r\n\r\nI know, I know. . .
