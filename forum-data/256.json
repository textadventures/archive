While I love it for some tasks like defining rooms, objects and entering descriptions I find that I am still more comfortable using a text editor to enter/edit script commands, ect.\n\nBeing cautious I have been using one program (i.e. QDK), saving my file, closing that pogram, then opening the other progam (say textpad) loading the ASL, editing, saving, closing, and so on.\n\nDoes anyone know if both QDK and your text editor can both be running the same ASL file at the same time [u:3py2qo9c]without causing problems[/u:3py2qo9c]. I did try it and to my suprise I had the same file open, made changes in both, saved both and  then checked and both changes were there.\n\nI can't help thinking though that this could cause some sort of problem but opening and closing back and fourth gets really old.\n\nThanks",

What happens is, if you have the file open in textpad, save changes to the game in QDK, then click on Textpad screen to make it active, it says something like \"this file has changed, load updated version?\" or something like that, then when you click ok, it loads up the updated stuff which you previously saved from QDK.  clever huh?\n\nOnly problem is, any changes made in the textpad file, then saved, wont be automatically saved in QDK, so you will need to reload the game in QDK again.",
