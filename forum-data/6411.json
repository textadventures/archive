      "EditableText": "Sounds like good advice and that may work for sinmantky, but I can feel his/her pain.  Even many times now (after 1000's of hours using Quest) if I try to paste snippets of code into code view, I don't understand a lot of times why it didn't work correctly.  More often than not its a spacing issue or a semi-colon/comma/period/bracketing issue AND most times I have a heck of a time figuring it out.  I never learned code and jumping right in is quite difficult - and let's face it, Quest is WAY easier if you understand code, even with a pretty user-friendly GUI.  \n\nThankfully, people like The Pixie and Jay and Pertex and others have been thankfully tolerant and wonderfully persistent when helping me when I don't understand a problem even after a presented solution that should be easy to understand given any background coding experience at all.  So thank you to all those that help!\n\n@sinmantky, My advice... Keep using Quest and frequent this forum to ask questions when you run into obstacles.  No question is too dumb.  I've asked many myself and seen many more.  I went through about 1/3 of the tutorial before I just started trying things on my own.  I have a dozen or so crap &quot;games&quot; that I started and butchered and fixed and butchered again... Finally I learned enough through trial and error (and seeking help on the forum) to create a pretty large game that I'm proud of and think is good.  Also, I tried to create a 'game' that was a GUI tutorial.  I stayed away from all code and tried to explain it it GUI terms only.  I know the interface is not super-intuitive but if you can get beyond that, I think it is pretty helpful.  Search either XanMag or Quest - Turorials and Templates to find this game.  Download it.  Play it.  See if this is a helpful tool.  Please make suggestions also for things that you'd like to see or things that you would like changed.  I want it to be useful.  If you can't find it, you can ask on the forum or PM me. \n\nGood luck and keep gaming!\n\nXanMag",
