If not, excuse me.\nAlso, I tried to find related post or infos but found nothing.\n\nHere is my problem:\nEverytime I try to run the &quot;play&quot; mode after creating something, it fails : the windows open, but won't go farer than showing inventory, directions,etc...and everything else stay blank. It doesn't write the usual sentences as &quot;you are there&quot; for exemple. Then I can't do anything except quit. After that, the creation part is now slowed, and it becomes a pain to use.\n\nHelp! Did I missed to read something, is there minimum specifications required to run it?\n\nThanks",
