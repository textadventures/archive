That's the first thing, which doesn't work on the fly, because of the missing DevApp in iOS Store.\r\n\r\nCreating the App on my own needs an paid phonegap account...\r\n\r\nSo if I tried to create an android app, there has to be build an config.xml first. I did that too, but there are errors in the created app.\r\n\r\nHas onyone a workaround for phonegap?\r\n\r\nOr otherwise does someone know a html to native app converter? I don't like an web-app, because my squiffy game includes many .svg images. While using a webApp there will be downloadtraffic all the time, which I tried to avoid by building a native app.\r\n\r\n",
