So like, right now when you click on an object in the panel it shows buttons like &quot;Look&quot; &quot;Take&quot; &quot;Use&quot;  but instead of that I want it to just automatically look at the object instead.  So I could name the object &quot;Look at such and such&quot; and change the panel to be &quot;Actions&quot; rather than Objects.... am I making any sense?",

I like Quest because of generally how easy it is to use, but my girlfriend is currently playing an adult game on a Russian thing (Quest Soft Player) which has an &quot;Action&quot; pane where it just lists the actions and you click which one you want.  She wants me to make her something similar that actually has proper English and not the crappy translated stuff in her game. I just feel that if I were to make it similar I could change the Object pane to &quot;Actions&quot; but it might be just one too many clicks to have to have a drop down menu with each action with the verb &quot;Take Action&quot; or something to that effect.  I mean it would be simpler I was just hoping to reduce the clicking amount, and she doesn't want to use the command bar.",

I'm only a noob, so wait for the more knowledgeable people, like Jay or Pixie, as they might be able to help you in doing this in an easy way (or if difficult they can help you through it).\n\nas far as I understand, since the 'objects and places' (or whatever it is called, lol) pane on the right, uses Objects, the problem is in the Objects themselves. As the Object, is an Object (that you can click on as a button), and then the 'Verbs', are actually Script Attributes of a (that) specific Object, and thus are a 2nd clickable, as a (sub) button. So, to have you to be able to click on an Object and it does a Verb, means first and foremost, you'd have to have only one Verb or providing a selection of which Verb to execute anyways, and 2nd of all, you have to re-code the underlying code for it to bypass the Object as a clickable button, going straight to its Verb activation (and bypassing the Verb/s as clickable sub buttons of that Object).\n\nthus, quest has other means of achieving this effect, via using Commands and/or the hyperlinks in/as the text in the big text box left pane.",
