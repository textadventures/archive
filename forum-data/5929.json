      "EditableText": "FYI... I thought it was worth playing for sure.  I'm not sure if knowing 'Diggy's Adventure' would make a difference in my opinion.  I do know that I only got through most of the quiz maze because I had Google opened in another tab.  For the maze part, it would be cool if there were things somewhere in the maze that gave hints to answers.  Some I deduced from the pictures.  Maybe there was and I missed it?  Also, the egg part was a neat touch but I was annoyed that I ran into eggs that I couldn't pick up because you could only hold one at a time.  Right?  So I'd have to drop an egg to pick up another just to find the correct dragon again.  Again, not bad especially as a game book (which has limitations that text adventures do not).  The battleship thing was neat but I think I got very lucky on my first play by guessing it correctly the first time through.  Not sure if I'd like it or not if I had to randomly hunt the grid for the little boat.  Does the ship move with each attempt?\n\nOverall, good game.  I challenge you to turn something like this into a text adventure.  It seems like you've figured your way around a GB well enough.  With a TA, your options and pretty much endless.  This game is good but seems better suited to be created using a TA.  Go for it!!  Double dog dare!",
