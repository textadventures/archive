Initially set the prelever obect to visible and the postlever to hidden. This will allow you to switch the visibility of the two objects when the lever is pulled and create the right impression <!-- s:-) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:-) --> Obviously each object being independent means they can have entirely different properties.\n\n2: If the lever is only going to add additional properties or change those that already exist, you can define a type with the additional properties and simply inherit this additional type in your original object when the lever is pulled - see the ASL code manual for the type &lt;obj name;type&gt; tag.\n\nIf this makes no sense at all, drop me an e-mail / reply here and I'll post a little demo of both methods for you.\n\nActually, it'll be my first demo since the new forums began - whooo!\n\nGood luck with Quest\n\nAl",
