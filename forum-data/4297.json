Until now... I am trying to create a puzzle where the player enters a room with four pillars. They need to place four blocks on the correct pillars to receive a key which unlocks a box. Two problems...\n\n1. At various times, placing the block in the correct place elicits no response and does not remove the object from inventory, although it does seem to set the object flag as I want it to, suggesting I messed something up in the &quot;else&quot; programming. I'm trying to make it so this only works if all four pillars are set correctly.\n\n2. The key, once received, unlocks the box, but will not open it. I noticed that under container I can't check the box &quot;can be opened&quot; (perhaps because it's set to lockable item). I *do* have the &quot;open automatically if player has key&quot; box checked, but that doesn't seem to be happening.\n\nI'm attaching two versions of the game, because I tried it two different ways -- one using &quot;else&quot; one using &quot;else if&quot; (not clear on the difference between the two commands). Both have a walkthrough that takes you to the room with the problem.
