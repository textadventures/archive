In another thread was a code along the lines of request (Hide, &quot;Command&quot;) which didn't seem to work either, although that could be because I'm implementing it incorrectly.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated, cheers.",

Select &quot;hide&quot; in the dropdown list and leave the rest blank.\n5) When you want to restore the command bar, copy/paste the same script, but select &quot;show&quot; in the dropdown list.\n\nHope it will be helpful  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->",
