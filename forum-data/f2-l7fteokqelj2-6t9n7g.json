So, right now I am having this problem:\r\n\r\nThe player is in room A and he wants to go to room B. Naturally he clicks on the exit that goes from A to B.\r\n\r\nAt this moment (I deal with what follows in the \"On Enter\" script for room B) a NPC shouts \"Hey, don't go there!\". The player prefers to desist, and so I put him back in room A. (End of script)\r\nAnd then room A's description is displayed _twice_. How can I avoid that? Actually I would prefer the description not to be displayed at all. _Once_ would be OK (I have a workaround) but certainly not _twice_. Twice spoils everything.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nThierry",
