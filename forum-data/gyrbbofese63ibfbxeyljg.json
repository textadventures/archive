You guys were very helpful. Mr. Angel in particular took time to explain things and showed me code to do what I wanted. Not sure I ever properly thanked him. \r\n\r\nWell, I got busy with other things. Recently I again got interested in IF. Tried to write a game in Excel VBA. It would work, I think, but not easily. So I'm trying Quest again. Going through the tutorial. I remember a lot; Forgotten a lot too.\r\n\r\nNow what I'm specifically trying to do, in the tutorial game, is empty the garbage bin. That's easy enough. But I want to make it more complicated. Want to give User a choice.\r\n\r\n\"Empty garbage bin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you want to empty it?\r\n1. Kitchen floor.\r\n2. Out the window.\r\n3. In the dumpster.\"\r\n\r\nAny ideas??",

If you are setting up a verb to empty the garbage bin, it would work like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\noptions = NewStringList()\r\nlist add (options , \"Kitchen floor.\")\r\nlist add (options , \"Out the window.\")\r\nlist add (options , \"In the dumpster.\")\r\nShowMenu (\"Where do you want to empty it?\", options, false) {\r\n  msg (\"You empty the garbage bin \" + result)\r\n  switch (result) {\r\n    case (\"Kitchen floor.\") {\r\n      // Handle kitchen floor choice\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"Out the window.\") {\r\n      // Handle window choice\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"In the dumpster.\") {\r\n      // Handle dumpster choice\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also create the list using the split function if you like it more compact. the first message below ShowMenu is in order to show the result chosen and optional. You may tweak it a little bit to get proper grammar in both the menu options and the message.. or you just deal with this within the cases.",
