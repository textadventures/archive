Can i do experience levels in the game?\n\nI want a game where i want experience levels, obviously\n\n2. Can i do multiple different skill levels and new skills that i can use?\n\nI want a game with crafting and magic and the like. \n\n3. Can i make a game where i can shapeshift into any type of creature in the game and have a different experience level for each creature that i turn into\n\n4. Can i also be shifted into one of those creatures and add experience to my main character's 'shifter leve'\n\nObviously getting too ambitious here and probably going outside the intended functionality of the game engine, but is it possible?\n\n5. This should be easy if i can find a way to shapeshift, but can i make it possible to make small spaces or high spaces that i could only go into if i shifted into something small like a mouse or something that can fly like a bird?\n\nI'd like this game to involve a lot of strategy alongside the normal go kill things theme of games with experience levels and shifting into smaller things, things that can fly, etc. would be a fun way to approach this\n\n6. Can i make a 'perception level' where if i examine my environment it will do a check on my perception skill to check if i see the exit or object or whatever? \n\nThat way a newbie wont automatically see every possibl hidden object and exit in an area, it'll make the game more fun and a bit surprising when you go back to a newbie area and find an exit to some awesome remote location\n\n\nAnd lastly, how much time would it probably take to do all this? my limited experience in programming is telling me this will take hundreds of hours, but the setup on this program seems much more user friendly",

There's no way of telling that, as it depends on many factors including your familiarity with Quest's scripting language and your ability to figure out how to implement things using it. From the sounds of it though, this game is likely a little large in scope for a first game. You'd probably be better off starting smaller, and as you become more familiar with Quest moving up to bigger projects.",
