(example: Location = Your House)\n\nI am working to customize the descriptions of the room using the example room customization script I found in the documentation.\nI want to change the blue bar at the top of the text box to reflect the location. (example:  [Your House] - Master Bedroom).\nIs there any way to change this text to be able to use properties or do I need to type [Your House] - Master Bedroom etc into the Alias.\n\nI was wondering the best way to handle this.  I want to format the output so the location is shown for each area in my game.\n\nThanks for your time",
