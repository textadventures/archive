However in some when i change to GUI view i can only see the left side of the screen. The side with the GUI text not the right side GUI panel. Is it a version thing or a security thing or am i missing something. As mentioned i can see some games GUI panel and some not. I have tried different version of guest vs different version of guest games and it doesn't seem to matter.\r\n\r\nAnyone else with this issue? How to solve will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks guys.\r\n\r\nExample: The horror within and Into the unknown works but The Lunastone or A story of Salvation and many others don't. Is it maybe a publishing vs testing thing?\r\n",

Quest displays them differently to the .aslx presumably on the basis .quest cannot be edited. You can view the source code if you unzip it first, but as all the library files are included it can be pretty difficult to work out what is going on, so it may not be that helpful.",
