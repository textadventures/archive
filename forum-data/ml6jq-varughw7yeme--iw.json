Just assign any object to the wt_obj type, enter the fire attributes, done.  \r\n\r\nIt also handles day/night and a few other things. I've started documentation but it's incomplete. I can post the template with what documentation I have. I'd be nice if the game platform itself handled fire the way I've set it up, and day/night cycles, and ambiance. Not sure which forum to post it in that has attachments.",
