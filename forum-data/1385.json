Reason I ask is I am considering buying Quest but I dont want to pay 30.00 dollars now only to find out v4 will be out next month or something and have to pay some more money for an upgrade or whatever.  I would rather wait? Or is there a cut off for example any user that buys 3.x from this date until 4.0 release will get a free upgrade?\n\n\nThanks",
