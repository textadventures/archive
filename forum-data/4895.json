The choices themselves lead to a sort of pseudo POV change where for example, this playthrough I was the outlaw who robbed the train, next playthrough I was the outlaw who had a change of heart and shot my accomplices before they robbed everyone blind.<br/><br/>In the end you get this:<br/><br/>Roots: Man who needs money<br/>Trunk: Mixed up with outlaws<br/>Branches: A, Rob train. B, Save train.<br/>Twigs: Shot three other men on a train, how do I prove I was saving them without making myself out to be guilty too?<br/>Stem: Convince everyone they were outlaws and you remembered seeing their face on a wanted poster.<br/>Bud: Cash reward for saving train.<br/><br/>The beginning and end line up in the same general way. The big difference is how you get there. Not to say all of my paths lead to the same ending scene or even the same type of ending. Or are about cowboys. Or trains. Or trees.",

(it's infinitely long, as you can always make smaller and smaller measurements, think of having to measure it with a meter~yard stick, vs a half-meter~yard stick, vs a 1/3 meter~yard stick, etc etc etc, the smaller, more precise the measuring tool, the more distance you discover, due to the infinity of its fractualization)<br/><br/>if you have to walk 10 feet, and each step you take cuts remaining distance in half, you'll never reach 10 feet, as this is infinity too.<br/><br/>the measurement of NATURE is infinity, and Fractuals is the math to measure infinity:<br/><br/>Fractals: Hunting for the Hidden Dimension ( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s65DSz78jW4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s65DSz78jW4</a><!-- m --> )<br/><br/>uber cool video, and fascinating math~physics~science subject.<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>there's no such thing as mathematical truths (math and science are religions~beliefs, and just as aloof as the rest of the religions~beliefs, there are no truths, only faith, we have faith that our math and physics 'laws' are correct... but later we learn that they're not, just like with early religions~beliefs such as what are now known as mythologies ~ philosophies ~ Religions, though with genetic engineering we may soon have centaurs and minotaurs and etc hybrids, and etc mythos or even godly stuff, lol), as, as we discover more and more, we learn that what we thought was mathematical truth, was completely incorrect. some examples: understanding of time (we still have no idea, it's uber complicated: not just as space-time, but even just with film~animation physics and movement physics itself as just being static~still 'snapshots~pictures', yet we have movement, seemingly anyways, lol), newtonian physics vs quantum physics, and etc etc etc<br/><br/>and then... we always USE math... which means, we twist it, using it for our AGENDA... we can pick and choose what numbers to use or how to ask the questions (for example in a statistics survery~poll or a 'scientific study', haha... right...)<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>ya, I wasn't writing those things in terms of a logical construct... laughs... (though I do love circular logic, it's fun, and it's actually debatable in whether it is a falicy or not, as the real world has lots of circular stuff... it has validity, so it's thus not neccessarily a falicy)...<br/><br/>I love this logic challenge:<br/><br/>The below sentence is true.<br/>The above setence is false.<br/><br/>And I don't understand the difficulty in the &quot;chicken vs~or the egg&quot;, of course the chicken comes first, as the egg is CREATED BY the (female) chicken. What's so unknown... ??? HK scratches his head... it's a very simple biology 101 question+answer... sighs. Gamates (sex chromosomes: X and Y: egg:XX and sperm:XY) are the products of a mature organism, they have no other origin, they're MADE by the mature organism. You can't have a product, without having its producer first.<br/><br/>anyways... (I'm wandering... lol)....<br/><br/>I explain though what I meant by them (I might have edited this in after you read my post, if you didn't see them there):<br/><br/>&quot;For one to be good at offense, one must know defense (so you know how to beat it), for one to be good at defense, one must know offense (how will they try to beat my defense, allowing me to beat their offense). how can you know defense if you don't know how defense is attacked? how can you know offense, if you don't know how offense is defended against? Know thy enemy and thy self, Know thy enemy's and thy self's, strategy+tactics (HK).&quot;",

Or do we? <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> And the biggest bastion of mistrust is this here Internet. The signal to noise ratio is so low. People question how some can doubt we went to the Moon or doubt the value of vaccinations or believe that the Illuminati are plotting a New World Order, but it all boils down to a crisis of trust, whether it be in the government or the medical institution or whatever, most of which have become tainted by power or monetary concerns - generally, other agendas from what they should have, which makes them suspect. People have lost trust and rebel against the loss of certainty about things we can't verify ourselves or find reliable, trusted sources for.)<br/><br/>But... you can strive to prove your beliefs as opposed to blindly and dogmatically argue them, and that's what science tries to do, with a methodical scientific approach. It might not be perfect, but in theory, it's the best system we have to discover how this Universe we live in actually works.<br/><br/>And now back to my game. Or the dishes. Or something. If you can believe that...",

Of course reality tends not to imitate art in that sense and politics provided better answers for the way the world is which I found way more boring if slightly more enlightening. To those ends, I'd compare the vast majority of conspiracy theories with religion. Easy answers provided in an exciting package. And far more interesting (and understandable! ) than bending your mind around Das Kapital or anything by Friedrich Hayek.",

I use 'ether' as it's a good word (as it's an old word, which means exactly what it's needed for, which is) to describe that which is outside of science. Yes, our universe is the inside of a black hole, the barrier edge of our universe, is an event horizon, to us inside the black hole (our universe), nothing exists beyond our universe's barrier edge, just as nothing exists beyond the barrier edge of a black hole, for the stuff inside of a black hole.\n\nthis is what I mean by beliefs, of science and religion and mythology being the same.\n\n---------\n\nthe science on science:\n\nscience is scientifically proven 100% incorrect\n\nscience at it's heart is observation (as what is observable is testable), but that observation is based upon our senses (touch, feel, smell, sound, taste, and thought), but our observations are distorted, they're fake, 'photo-shopped' (manifested) by our brain, which twists the real world into a world that we as organisms can function in. For an example, there's no such thing as sight, your 'eyes' are just HOLES to the back of your brain, the world that you see is actually a picture projection by your brain, everything that you see isn't real, it's a manifestation of your brain. Also, once you observe something, you change it from what you wanted to observe. Whether it's a person's behavior driving when not having a cop car nearby (they speed) or having a cop car nearby (they stay at the speed limit), how a person behaves when they're not being watched~filmed, vs when they are being watched~filmed, as it is with trying to observe an electron, and lastly, all of our science is no different than religion and mythology, we craft our 'science~world' in a way that will make sense to us, as we can't understand what we can't understand, and so our scientific world is merely a world that makes sense to us (exactly as it is~was with the religious world or the mythological world), and not what the world actually is, since we wouldn't be able to function in such a world that we can't even fathom.\n\nSo, as much as we try to rationalize science as being more concrete than religion and mythology, it really is not, it's no more firmly established than a religion or a mythology.
