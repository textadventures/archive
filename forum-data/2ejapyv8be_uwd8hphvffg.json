      "EditableText": "Some things I have found:\r\n1. You are placing Exit: School inside an object you created called Command, perhaps you are trying to create your own command, but this is now how command works, but anyway, lets choose the easier route, drag your Exit:School up one level or inside front of the school, now your exit is working, yes, there is no need to do commands, your whole game can be just click to play.\r\n2. I have found another long code at Lockers, it seems to be lock and unlock verb, I am not sure what is your intention but I will write a simple lock and unlock verb for you.\r\n3. Lock verb\r\n```\r\nMakeObjectInvisible (gold nuggets)\r\n```\r\nUnlock verb\r\n```\r\nMakeObjectInvisible (gold nuggets)\r\n```\r\n4. As you can see here, I am not really unlocking and locking it because I do not know how, why bother to learn how when you have something faster?\r\nCreate a object called \"golden box\" and \"gold nuggets\".\r\nPut lock and unlock verbs at golden box.\r\nUnclick gold nuggets's visible checkbox to make it invisible.\r\nViola, your fake lock and unlock verb is done.\r\n\r\n5. Okay, now we have Picture of Kristen inside Your locker which is a different object from Lockers which have that lock and unlock verb. This seems wrong, you seems to want to control three 3 items by coding from 1 item. Your code is recommended to be placed inside the object that you want to control. If you are trying to open and close a locker, it might be best to just have one locker and write your lock and unlock verb inside it.\r\n\r\n6. Inside picture of Kristen, there is a code: After taking the object, unlock exit 3, this is a clever puzzle except that there is no exit 3, therefore this script will not run. To fix it, click expression tab and choose exit tab instead, and choose the prewritten exit that you want.\r\n\r\n7. At brian, this is a little bit funny, you have a speak to verb, which calls in three functions, P, P and converse but you have not written a function yet. To write a function you have to right click object tree and click add function or alt +f. But seriously, there is no need to learn function as well. Perhaps you could do this code instead.\r\n\r\n8. This code will automatically makes your chit chat more interesting by checking if your player is holding gold nuggets or whatever object or not.\r\n```\r\nif (Got(gold nuggets)) {\r\n  msg (\"Wow, what is that?\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"Man, I am starving.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n9. Now you have Where is Kristen and What do I do objects inside Brian, I suppose you are trying to create a conversation, which is once again, not how it works, you cannot control multiple items together. What I would recommend is my bad but working way:\r\nAdd in the two verbs at Brian object: \r\nVerb 1 : Where is Kristen?\r\nVerb 2 : What do I do?\r\n\r\nInside the custom verbs are simply:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"I heard she went to get something back from the crows- you know how they love to steal shiny objects, no one's seen her since. I wonder if the crows have her locked in one of the classrooms?\")\r\n```\r\n10. At classroom object, there is another clever puzzle, enter the room for first time, lock exit door. So this is a good example of a working script.\r\n11. So once again, you are trying to do a non-working code by placing Box, Shiny, under and heart inside of Alter. I would recommend to just make it simple and just place them inside Classroom with the rest of the objects.\r\n12. You have Door and door, because the app does not allows you to have two objects of the same name, but below the name, there is alias, alias means nickname, you can simply write Door and Door inside alias, the app does not care about nicknames.\r\n13. Your game only have 4 rooms, it is recommended to redo and avoid those strange container codes, your made up code by putting objects inside of each other as if they can command each other to do stuffs.\r\n14. Simplify your game and spam more of Look at and run msg script at enter room instead.\r\n15. Learn from the best, these few games uses less coding, focuses more on Look at while their game is still entertaining.\r\n16. Games list: (From shortest game length to longest game length.)\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/yperrhjdm0qynwrbee8j_g/the-chimney-sweeper\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/2yhvvr5gye_wmngukrj4dq/a-toshers-legacy\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/nxbydiel0usqwa6q0tpmsw/where-is-everyone\r\n17.

If you change the order of rooms in the sidebar, for example, it might become `exit12` or something. That's a common way for older parts of a game to suddenly stop working later in development; and if it happens when the game has grown bigger, it'll be harder to find.\r\n\r\n> the scripts don't seem to be able to unlock objects, only exits.\r\n\r\nNot actually true. The `UnlockExit` function works just fine on objects; it's just the name that's misleading (and I think the GUI will only give you a list of exits to choose from… but if you edit it in code view and put in the name of an object it will work fine)\r\n\r\nIt can be a little confusing, because locked exits and lockable containers are two different mechanics, and work in different ways. But they both have a `locked` attribute which must be `true` or `false`.\r\n\r\nThe following three statements do exactly the same thing:\r\n* `SetObjectFlagOff (object, \"locked\")`\r\n* `UnlockExit (object)`\r\n* `object.locked = false` - this one is more efficient\r\n\r\n> the player uses the 'heart' object as a key to unlock the box, but there doesn't seem to be a simple way to do that\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a somewhat bizarre known issue with the editor.\r\nMake the box \"lockable\" in the editor, and type \"1\" in the \"number of keys\" box.

I can see that you tried to do that, but in the code posted above you have:\r\n```\r\n        <useon type=\"scriptdictionary\">\r\n          <item key=\"heart\">\r\n            SetObjectFlagOff (Box, \"Locked\")\r\n          </item>\r\n        </useon>\r\n```\r\nThat will set the attribute `Locked` to `false` … which won't do anything, because the open/close commands use the attribute `locked` (no capital letter - as far as Quest is concerned, that's a completely different attribute)\r\n\r\nI'm typing on my phone here, and don't have Quest handy, so sorry if I've made some errors. But I think I've got most of this right.",
