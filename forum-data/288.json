      "EditableText": "Just bought it yesterday.  45 minutes after I downloaded the trial version I decided I liked it and got it.  I've been looking for an easier to use Text Adventure Engine forever, and this one is finally it.  Not that I'm lazy or anything, but I think it's easier to write better games with easier software because you focus less on programming and more on the storyline and gameplay.  I'm already part of the way through making a game using QuestNet in which the players can either work together, try to solve the game for themselves, or battle each other to the finish.  I'm making sure that there are multiple paths and endings, and it will be non-linear.  Great program, Thanks!!!    <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",

Partly because it's too expensive.  I dont really use it anymore either, but i have some game source code saved because i did alot of work on it, and maybe ill write some more on it soon.",
