I tried the game again:\n\nI try going up and down the stairs a few times:\n&quot;u&quot; - I go up.\n\nBut...\n&quot;climb up stairs&quot; ... it doesn't work.\n\nBut then...\n&quot;go climb up stairs&quot; ... and that works!\n\n\n\nHow can I set it so that I don't _need_ to use the word &quot;go&quot; before the ALT name of my exit?
