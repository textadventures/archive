It returns an error 500 with the following message:\r\n**Server Error in '/' Application.**\r\n\r\nThis is very unfortunate as the web riddle Do Not Believe Her Lies (https://donotbelieveherlies.com/) has a text adventure on play2.textadventures.co.uk, at the final stages of the riddle. A couple of solvers reached that level, and aren't able to progress anymore.\r\n\r\nI hope this error will be resolved soon.
