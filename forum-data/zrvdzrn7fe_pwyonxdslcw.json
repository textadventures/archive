      "EditableText": "I would point out that if you do it this way, you will have to take account of every circumstance in which an item can be added to or removed from the player's inventory. A box you can pick up will have to have code to change your weight for all its contents as well as itself. Potions will have to subtract their own weight when used. If you have a weapon with expendable ammo, do arrows have a weight? A thief stealing an item will have to change the player's weight as well.\r\n\r\nYou end up with the same code in dozens of places; maybe even hundreds. It would be much simpler to have your `encumbered` function add up the weight of everything the player is carrying each time it is called.\r\n\r\nOr… use the `changedparent` script attribute. This is called whenever an object is moved from one place to another, regardless of whether it was moved by a command or another script. You could make it something like:\r\n```\r\n// first find the weight of this object and anything inside it\r\ntotalweight = this.weight\r\nforeach (contents, GetAllChildObjects(this)) {\r\n  if (HasAttribute (contents, \"weight\")) {\r\n    totalweight = totalweight + contents.weight\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nif (not oldvalue = null) {\r\n  if (oldvalue = player or Contains (player, oldvalue)) {\r\n    player.weight = player.weight - totalweight\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nif (Contains (player, this)) {\r\n  player.weight = player.weight + totalweight\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  this.equipped = false\r\n}\r\nencumbered\r\n```\r\nThat would work if you take or drop the object, if you put it inside something else, if a thief steals it, or if it's eaten. Using the changed scripts means that you only have to write that code once, and you don't have to worry about remembering to include it every time you script an encounter that could change the ownership of an item. It's a very useful technique to learn.",

      "HTML": "<p>I would point out that if you do it this way, you will have to take account of every circumstance in which an item can be added to or removed from the player's inventory. A box you can pick up will have to have code to change your weight for all its contents as well as itself. Potions will have to subtract their own weight when used. If you have a weapon with expendable ammo, do arrows have a weight? A thief stealing an item will have to change the player's weight as well.</p>\n<p>You end up with the same code in dozens of places; maybe even hundreds. It would be much simpler to have your <code>encumbered</code> function add up the weight of everything the player is carrying each time it is called.</p>\n<p>Or… use the <code>changedparent</code> script attribute. This is called whenever an object is moved from one place to another, regardless of whether it was moved by a command or another script. You could make it something like:</p>\n<pre><code>// first find the weight of this object and anything inside it\ntotalweight = this.weight\nforeach (contents, GetAllChildObjects(this)) {\n  if (HasAttribute (contents, \"weight\")) {\n    totalweight = totalweight + contents.weight\n  }\n}\nif (not oldvalue = null) {\n  if (oldvalue = player or Contains (player, oldvalue)) {\n    player.weight = player.weight - totalweight\n  }\n}\nif (Contains (player, this)) {\n  player.weight = player.weight + totalweight\n}\nelse {\n  this.equipped = false\n}\nencumbered\n</code></pre>\n<p>That would work if you take or drop the object, if you put it inside something else, if a thief steals it, or if it's eaten. Using the changed scripts means that you only have to write that code once, and you don't have to worry about remembering to include it every time you script an encounter that could change the ownership of an item. It's a very useful technique to learn.</p>\n\n",
