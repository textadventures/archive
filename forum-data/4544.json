I suspect it might have been caused by having two versions of Quest! installed (I thought one had upgraded to later version but apparently it just installs a separate version) although that's a guess really. Another possible cock up on my part might have been to save the game whilst testing it or something. I don't mind posting the file if it helps shed some light on what I may have done wrong or if it's a fixable bug.",
