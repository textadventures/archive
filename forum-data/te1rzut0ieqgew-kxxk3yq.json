      "EditableText": "Hello! I just started working in Quest. I have checked the box for 'Disable automatically generated display verb list for this object' as well as deleted all of the 'Display verbs' for all my objects. I did this because I want it to have a simpler look without hyperlinks and verb suggestions for objects to encourage experimentation and exploration in my game.\r\n\r\nMy question is, how do I remove the script/function that causes any item I pick up to appear in the room with a blue hyperlink? Granted, this only happens for one turn, but I'd like to remove it anyway.\r\n\r\nFor example, my room has a newspaper. It blends in nicely with the room description as an object (no bright hyperlink to it!) and has an interesting description when examined ('yellowed and crinkled') and read ('so boring you nearly fall asleep reading it'). But when I pick it up and its in my inventory, it suddenly appears in the room description as a blue hyperlink (for one turn). I don't want that.\r\n\r\nHow do I disable this hyperlink feature so that when I pick up the newspaper, it simply disappears from the room description and appears in my inventory? Thanks!",
