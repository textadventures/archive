      "EditableText": "When using expressions there needs to be an even amount of quotation marks used. The error you are getting is telling you that there is an odd number of quotation marks.\n\nWhen you are using the &quot;print a message&quot; script there are two options in the drop down box. One is message which prints everything exactly as you write it. The other, which the tutorial is getting you to use in this case, is an expression. With expressions it won't just print exactly what you type, it will print strings that are stored somewhere else. In the case of the tutorial example:\n\n&quot;You say \\&quot;&quot; + text + &quot;\\&quot;, but nobody replies.&quot;\n\nthe + text + bit is you telling Quest to print out whatever text the player typed in. When using the expression mode however, using the quotation marks tells quest to print this bit directly as you have written it. If there are an odd number of quotation marks, it sees the first one and thinks &quot;right, I have to start printing the following letters here&quot; but never reaches the next one telling it to stop.\n\nFinally, the backslash is used to tell Quest that this ISN'T a quotation mark it should take any notice of, but one that should be printed like any other character between the two quotation marks.\n\nSo looking at your error, it looks like you've either got a backslash in front of a quotation mark, meaning quest doesn't realise that it's there to mark the start or end of what you want to print, or you have missed out a quotation mark somewhere else, likely before the word &quot;but.&quot;\n\nYou need to have the quotation marks stop and start before and after the + signs as well, because they're there to tell Quest that you want it to print these 3 things next to each other in a line. Your saying, first print this text between these quotation marks (You say &quot;) AND THEN print whatever the player has entered in place of the word text AND THEN print this last thing written between these quotation marks (&quot; but nobody replies.)\n\nHope this helps.",
