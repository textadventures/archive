      "EditableText": "If you're asking whether it's possible to import your TADS code into Quest and keep working on the game, the answer is no. You'd need to start the game from scratch in Quest, but considering Quest is a lot easier to use than TADS it should be fairly quick work to get the game implemented.\n\nAs an example, I recreated the game Thy Dungeonman from the homestarrunner.com website in Quest in about an hour, hour and a half. And that was just by playing the game to get the layouts, room descriptions, objects, etc. Once I saw how it was all put together I just built it in Quest.",

Programming languages aren't cross-compatible like that, much like you wouldn't be able to take some code written in QBasic and be able to compile it in C#.\n\nJust for the record however, there are a couple of &quot;meta&quot; languages that can apparently compile into other languages.
