What we can do instead is nest two if statements to test for a range.\r\n\r\nTry this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Strength:** {strength}{if strength<2: (very weak)}{if strength>=2:{if strength<=3: (weak)}}\r\n```\r\nChanging the 2 and 3 can make any inclusive range, so this works: \r\n```\r\n{if value>=10:{if value<=25:{value} is in between 10 and 25 inclusive}}\r\n```",
