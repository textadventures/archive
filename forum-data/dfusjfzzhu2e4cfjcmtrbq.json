Even after you open the curtains and look through the window for example, it never prints the message \"You close the curtains\" but instead it reads 'It's already closed.' when you click on 'close the curtains'.\r\n\r\nI'm using Quest 5.8 and I am NOT using commands in my game (even disabled the command bar).\r\n\r\nCreated an object 'Curtains' -> Container Tab (openable/closeable) ticked 'can be opened' 'can be closed' ,but NOT Is open.\r\n```\r\n <object name=\"Curtains\">\r\n      <inherit name=\"editor_object\" />\r\n      <inherit name=\"openable\" />\r\n      <feature_container />\r\n      <useindividualverblist type=\"boolean\">false</useindividualverblist>\r\n      <usestandardverblist />\r\n      <displayverbs type=\"stringlist\">\r\n        <value>Look at</value>\r\n        <value>Open</value>\r\n        <value>Close</value>\r\n      </displayverbs>\r\n      <openscript type=\"script\">\r\n        MakeObjectVisible (Window1)\r\n        msg (\"You open the Curtains and can see a {object:Window1:Window}.\")\r\n      </openscript>\r\n      <closescript type=\"script\">\r\n        msg (\"You close the Curtains.\")\r\n      </closescript>\r\n    </object>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\n",
