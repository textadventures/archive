      "EditableText": "Right, I want to have an object, with \"alt\" names that you can use to refer easily to such an object.\nBUT, I am cloning this object - and cloning it more than once (up to about 5 times).\n\nFor example:\n[code:3f08ezrk]                    /------cloned_obj&#40;1&#41;\noriginal_object----+-------cloned_obj&#40;2&#41;\n                    \\------cloned_obj&#40;3&#41;[/code:3f08ezrk]\n\nAnd so is the original object is (say) \"banana\", then the cloned object's will have alias's of \"banana(1)\" etc....\n\nRight, now to refer to each object I shall use the command \"hit #object#\"...\n\nNow each object will have the same alt's... So if the object is \"banana(1)\" then typing \"hit ban(1)\" won't be recognised and \"hit ban\" will come up with a select choices or something (I hope).\n\nI think I may use the _ to seperate the alt from the number, and then go through each object and check their alt's and number - but I don't even know if this is possible... So I'd have to check the length (ban_1, gives 3 letters before the _), use that to get the length of letters from the object's name (get 3 letters from \"banana(1)\" = ban) and then check that, then get the last 3 ( the \"(1)\" ) then check that against the _1 ...\n\nBut what if I have an object like \"red banana\" and want \"r ban\" as a shortened term for it?\n\nI don't want endless properties added/checked... I suppose I could, and probably will choose properties some way if I can't get a better answer.\n\nSo can anyone help at all? Anything will be great!",
