      "EditableText": "Well do you have a status variable for the player's health? If not you should make one, afterwhich you should make a function that run in every instance that reduces the player's health. This is where procedures come in handy. \n\nGo into your script editing section for when your player's health is reduced, then add a conditional using \"Compare two strings or values\" and under string 1 put the variable for your player's health, choose under the box less than or equal to, and under string 2 put 0 or whatever it is you want your player's to die at. For actions its pretty simple, just put an end game function with losing messages.\n\nIt should look something like this:\n[code:1klmd4vz]define procedure &lt;LoseHealth&gt;\n\tif &#40; %PlayerHealth% &lt;= -10 &#41; then playerlose\nend define\n[/code:1klmd4vz]\n\nShouldn't be too dificult, just add in whatever else you need.  8)\n\nJust reply asking for more if that was too complicated and I'll spend a little more time breaking it down for ya.",
