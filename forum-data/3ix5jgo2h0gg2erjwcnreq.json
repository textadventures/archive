      "EditableText": "Hi, for the last couple monts, I've been trying to make gamebookish thing called Starpunk on Facebook. It's not a game as a programmed thing, but rather a collectively decided storyline where people choose how the story continues - the idea is that readers choose the outcome and then I \"novelize\" it as a prose (see here goo.gl/47WtX5) in order to use the Facebook page as a vehicle for writing a good oldfashioned book.\r\n\r\nAt least in theory, because less and less people vote on the story, and I'm darn unsure why is that.\r\n\r\nI've tried several approaches, notably a gallery where people voted to advance the story (see here goo.gl/VGf7xN), but it didn't get enough attention. So I switched to more \"rudimentary\" graphics (read: reused from elsewhere) and did a followup in a video form (see here goo.gl/23dMLN). Guess what - EVEN LESS people react on it.\r\n\r\nSo, as the title says, I'm at the end of my wits. I have other, quite succesfull Facebook page about science, so it's not like I haven't done this before. Yet, I'm unsure how to present the thing better, given the zero budget. Maybe the video is too long? Maybe I should have stayed with gallery? Maybe the story just plain sucks! Too many possibilities here...\r\n\r\nSo I came here hoping that people around here might give me couple advices about what THEY would prefer, so I'd unfuck my little project. Or maybe bury it.\r\n\r\nPS: I've posted this text also on reddit, so, full disclosure for those that might think I'm spamming the world or something. \r\nPPS: Advices like \"you should have done it in a normal game engine\" might be right, but then again, the purpose of the project is to make an ordinary book, and I would be unable to collect data about choices and translate them into novelization.
