You bring nothing to a conversation but your craving for a high posts number.\n\nOtherwise, QDK often generates errors similar to the one you received for a lot of things and in general isn't TOO stable. It will often give errors out if you have too many of layers to your code or if some syntax is entered wrong. Also QDK sometimes writes code in a different, but still acceptable, way than most people would write their ASL. Generally the best solution is to look over anything you recently added to the code, try deleting that and then see if what you are doing works. ASL can be quite picky, the QDK can be even worse. It is recommended you read the help file extensively and learn ASL as it is quite easy. QDK realistically is best used for bug checking your work or figuring out a piece of syntax.",
