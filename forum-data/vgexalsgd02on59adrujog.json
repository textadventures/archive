I've tried editing it in HTML tools but once I've put text-align to center it just doesn't save. I've seen another post with the same problem but can't figure out where I'm supposed to type the solution they got. i don't know if it's supposed to be in the scripts tab and in code view or if I'm just not finding the save button in HTML tools. Does anyone know how to?",

But you could centre the menu section after it's been displayed. I'm on my phone now, so can't look up the attribute name you would need to look up. I'll try to remember it later in the day if nobody else comes up with the answer first. It should be a single JS line inserted immediately after the ShowMenu call.",
