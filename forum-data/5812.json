I don't want a space, I want a comma, and I don't want a period at the end, I was an exclamation point.\n\nThis is my first time working with Quest and working on a text adventure, so I'm not super familiar with code structure or layout yet. My initial thought is that I'm going to have to start tinkering with the libraries, but I'm not sure where to begin.\n\nAlso, if someone could point me to a resource on changing the room description after the first entrance. My initial descriptions are rather long and flavorful, and I want to pair them down to just the basics for subsequent viewings.\n\nThanks.",
