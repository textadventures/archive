      "EditableText": "  Hey, sorry for the apparent urgency in the title, I'm currently under a strict deadline. I'm making a text game from my schools coding art show, and I've come across a real stick in the mud. The game is one about magic, and wanted to create a system in which you could choose a school of magic to cast from. I used a menu to select it and then set that attribute equal to the player.class. Afterwards, I wanted to create a personalized message on the class they chose, yet I am having troubles. Here is an example of the code: \r\n```  msg (\"The man shuffles some pages around on his desk, before finally meeting your gaze again. \\\" Now for the exciting part, your school. Tell me, what sounds best to you? \\\" A page materializes before you with a pen to match. Inscribed on the parchment is the following list: \")\r\n  ShowMenu (\"Schools: \", Split (\" Fire; Frost; Time; Blood; Earth\",\";\"), false) {\r\n    player.class = result\r\n    if (player.class = \"Fire\" ) {\r\n      PrintCentered (\" The Clerk smiles, extending a abnormally warm hand to you. \\\" A fellow fire student?  I was like you once..\\\" The man is obviously reminiscing, yet about what is unclear. After a few long moments he rises to his feet and with a snap of his fingers, the room around you unfurls like origami to  reveal you are somewhere else entirely. \")\r\n    }   ``` \r\n\r\n\r\nI know that's a bit of a cluster, but I hope it can be deciphered. Essentially I'm using a menu to select it with the showmenu and then setting the player class like I said above, I then tried to use the player's class to define the message but quest is telling me that since they aren't existing variables, I can't do it. Thankyou for any and all responses. ",
