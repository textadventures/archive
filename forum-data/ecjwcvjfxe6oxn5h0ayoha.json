      "EditableText": "What verbs are displayed in an object's menu is determined by a couple of attributes. They are all lists:\r\n* `inventoryverbs` - if the object is held\r\n* `displayverbs` - if the object is not held\r\n* `generatedverbslist` - a list of verbs (from the object's \"Verbs\" tab), created automatically the first time the player sees it\r\n\r\nOn the object's \"Object\" tab, you can tick the box \"Disable automatically generated display verb list for this object\" to hide the generatedverbslist verbs; or \"Only display verbs from this object's Verbs tab\" to disable displayverbs/inventoryverbs.\r\n\r\nSo you can disable the automatically generated verbs list, and then manually add/remove verbs from the displayverbs attribute when you want to show or hide them. Or you could hide a verb by removing it from the automatic list, as long as you wait until the list has been generated first.\r\n\r\nThis only affects what is displayed in the menu/buttons. You probably want your verb to check if it's valid in case the player types it anyway.\r\n\r\nIf you want to actually remove a verb from an object, each verb has a script attribute which normally has the same name as the verb. Removing this removes the verb; but won't change the verbs menu if `generatedverbslist` has already been generated.",
