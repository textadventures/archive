I tried several experiments to learn to add a value to an attribute but so far I am not successful.\r\nFor example,\r\nPage1: Player chooses to learn Dance Skill [Dance +1]\r\nAnd in future pages, let's say Page12, the player gets a chance to improve his/her dance skill.\r\nPlayer clicks Yes and goes to Page13 where the trigger to a +1 awaits him/her.\r\nSo it'll be [Dance +2] now.\r\n\r\nOh and I set\r\n>dance = 0\r\n>\r\nin the game > script part. That's in code view.\r\nAnd then I used\r\n>set (player, \"dance\", \"1\")\r\n>\r\nWhen I added 1 value to the dance attribute.\r\n(I hope this helps you understand my case.)\r\n\r\nIn future pages, let's say Page20, there will be a condition to find a job. If the player's dance skill is +2 above, the player can apply but if not, the player cannot apply.\r\n\r\nHow do I do that? I am a beginner and I learn fast in screenshot/code view. It helps me study and compare the difference of this and that and how it works. Thank you in advance for your help!",
