      "EditableText": "I was given that title a long while ago.  Prior to the current admin even.  Been a while since I’ve been active and even longer since I have placed games.  The problems are:\r\n1.  It takes a while to sit and categorize and it’s a hobby (not a paid job).\r\n2.  Wading through the awful (and by awful I mean... make me want to jump out of a window awful)... games that are  published on this site may be the biggest gaming turnoff in the gaming world.\r\n3.  The overwhelming games (be them awful or not) largely come from two genres - animal simulation stuff or adult games.  Neither are anything close to my taste (no offense), so that kind of doubles the deterrent.\r\n\r\nFor those people who are SERIOUS about making a decent game I would suggest one of two (or both) of these options:\r\n1.  In the game announcement forum, state the genre/game description, ask for testers, make adjustments based on feedback, and THEN submit for publication.\r\n2.  Contact me (or any other mod directly through pm) and ask for it to be categorized.  \r\n\r\nBe warned... I am a grumpy old soul and am quite critical.  Ask me by all means to review and comment, but my genre is relatively narrow and I really, really dislike poor grammar and game design.  But, if it seems quality and complete, despite the genre, I will place it accordingly.  Ask if you have questions.  Happy gaming!",
