Type \"Q\" to quit or \"Hint\" for a tip etc. I would like the player to type in certain things but not be able to carry on with game which he can do. I can use code\" finish game\" but then he can't type in anything.\r\n\r\nHow do i disable the game play but still be able to type in certain keywords like \"q\", \"hint\", \"restart\" but not carry on with game play like \"go north\" or \"take object\".\r\n\r\nHelp appreciated. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n",
