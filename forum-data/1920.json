I believe that my personal experiences not only help me but also that the experiences of others are important to me. As result of this belief, I have been spending hours reading through the QDK forums and recording samples of code that I believe will help me to learn the basics of writing with QDK Pro. However, I'm still having lots of problems with pieces of code logic that I feel should be quite simple. So, please be patient with me if  I appear to be asking some truly basic questions in this forum. I've spent thousands of hours coding in Basic, Windows Visual Basic, Unix and in other computer languages. In fact, I've been working with computer hardware and software since 1966. Yes, Sonny! they were as big as a room way back then.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  \n\nIn reading through these forum topics,  I've seen that some people suggest coding some things directly into a QDK game/file. Are there ASL tutorials and such that might be available to me to help me recover my programming skills? What are some of the best QDK/ASL games to download to help me learn the basics?
