      "EditableText": "If gamers play games to kill time, the what would happen if gamers play a game where the objective IS to kill time?  In this game you take the place as some derp-of-a-stallion on a prototype lunar habitat with four other mares and are provided with various forms of entertainment such as a Star Trek-styled Holodeck, a kitchen, a library of books, a gym, and seperate bedrooms.\n\nAs a unicorn you can cast spells with a relatively simple UI, and learn more spells like Invisibility, Charm, Midas, and the infamous Terrorvision spell.  Integrated into the game is a map, and a military-style time system with day and night functions.  The bedrooms of the four mares mentioned earlier are secured with 4-digit passwords randomly generated by the game so no one can post that &quot;Rainbow Dash's code is 1234&quot;.  And to top it all off, the game can be played in two different ways:  ADVENTURE and TIME ATTACK modes.  Though there may not be ten truck-loads of content, I plan on frequently updating the game, adding a little something each time... after all, writing this game is my way of killing time.",
