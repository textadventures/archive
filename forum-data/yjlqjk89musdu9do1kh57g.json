Idealy I'd like to make it so a player can do 'x' command and it will delay the timer by 20 seconds (giving them more time to figure out the puzzle), but if they try to do 'y' action it will decrease by 20 seconds. I tried that with 'Set timer to expression -20, but that didn't seem to work. Anyone got an idea how to do this?",
