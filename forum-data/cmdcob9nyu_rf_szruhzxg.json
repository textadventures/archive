Should I be using the Clock library instead? On the surface it looks like it has more of the functionality that I want **IsNight** but I think it's older and it looks like Tracking Time was based on it. Does it still work? Since it looks like Tracking Time has a lot of the functionality of the Clock Library I'm assuming it's possible to achieve similar time of day based if statements but I don't know how to do that.",
