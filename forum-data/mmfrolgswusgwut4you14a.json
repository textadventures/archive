I have been using the web-based editor and I have to say that replies that include actual lines of code to accomplish the intended goal will likely be of little use to me. \r\n\r\nI have been attempting to nest one object within another so that the former cannot be seen until the latter is looked at. I know that containers accomplish the goal, but they seem rather clunky, especially when the command winds up being \"open pile of debris\". \r\n\r\nMy current method is to run a script when the pile of debris is looked at that moves the object \"large stick\" from a hidden room that I'm using for storage purposes into the current room. However, even with the command set to run, looking at the pile of debris doesn't reveal the large stick even though the script is saying that the stick should've moved into the room. What am I doing wrong?",

Simply adding a text message won't work because the stick seems to be invisible unless the places and objects tab is on, so I would say \"you've found a stick!\", the player would say \"take stick\", and the console would say \"I don't see that\".
