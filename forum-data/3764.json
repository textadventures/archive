I knew I wanted to make it an off-rails game, (meaning that most of the locations in the game are accessible from the first turn and it's how you interact with and explore the world that progresses the narrative,) so I knew I had to have my rooms laid out to begin with before populating them.\n\nOnce I had that as well as a basic concept and narrative outline, it became a fairly organic process from there. You have an idea for a plot line, then you start making the objects needed and scripting it. Then that will give you an idea for another plot line which you might need a new room for so you make that. Along the way you've created a scenery object which gives you an idea for a puzzle so you change it's properties a bit and incorporate it. You have an idea for a cool puzzle so you craft a narrative thread around it so that the puzzle makes sense within the context of your game. Then you go back and realise some of those rooms you built earlier were completely superfluous so you demolish them, or amalgamate them with another room.

Create a TO DO list for every long and short term goal from the creation of the ending narrative to the addition of a single line of script, and regularly add to and cross off from it.

You have an idea for a plot line, then you start making the objects needed and scripting it. Then that will give you an idea for another plot line which you might need a new room for so you make that. Along the way you've created a scenery object which gives you an idea for a puzzle so you change it's properties a bit and incorporate it. You have an idea for a cool puzzle so you craft a narrative thread around it so that the puzzle makes sense within the context of your game. Then you go back and realise some of those rooms you built earlier were completely superfluous so you demolish them, or amalgamate them with another room.
