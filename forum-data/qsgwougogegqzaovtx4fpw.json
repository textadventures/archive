Then I thought, if the items have an attribute for their location, should I should start by making the locations? Or should I do more outlining first, and then go through the game in order of play, rather than doing all the objects at once?\r\n\r\nPoint is, I'm now wondering about advice on that kind of design theory. Do I really need flow charts, for example. Is there a good wiki or article about that kind of stuff around that has become sort of an accepted traditional model?\r\n\r\nI'm also open to hearing your thoughts on all this, of course.

      "EditableText": "I have been working on something as a sort of exercice. It is a Gamebook, actually, because I have some aims in mind like making it more \"storywise\" and characters driven. You know... trying to test some theories of mine.\r\n\r\nBut in general, there are things I found useful, both for gamebooks and text adventures aswell. \r\n\r\nI strongly suggest having an outline. Perhaps you will find yourself working on layers of outline, and it is ok. The most time you spend on outlining your story and your game, the better. In my specific experience, I found myself working on a general outline for general \"events\" and then spliting it into scenes and then into pages. I was worried about this process, because I initially thought not having an absolute outline with everything possible would be a problem in the long run. But actually it helped me a lot on slicing the meaning of things and having a better perception of the whole game when needed and then dive into the details when convenient.\r\n\r\nHaving a general picture also gave me a boost on something essencial: the game system. Most people pictures a system and then tries making a game on top of it. In my case, having a look on the options in the outline, I could figure what sort of game system I needed both to support that narrative and make it interesting. What sort of mechanics would improve my narrative.\r\n\r\nI faced something very interesting on the drawing of the outline which relates to vignettes. Vignettes - for those not familiar to the term - is a little piece of the game. An event. The problem about vignettes, is that they a pretty much dissociated fro the general game. They usually exists because most games are 'map based' or 'event based'. When the character goes somewhere, there is that things happening there. It is - by principle - terrible for a narrative. Entering the pirate's den should be different dependng on the previous story. For vignettes, the general setup is always the same. Vignettes works as a little side game, what makes me reject it in general. But then came my realization: I HAD events THAT HAD to be that way, doesnt matter previous actions. So, my outline gained a sequence of Vignettes.\r\n\r\nIf vignettes are small, self contained portions of the game, how could I make it interesting and - above all - relevant to the game and the story itself? I intuitively did something already in use, later confirmed by \"Choice of Games\" documentation. They call it \"Playing by the numbers\". In their case, they decide the outcome of vignettes based on attributes the character has. I twisted the concept by using the vignettes to allow the player changing its numbers by decisions inside each vignette and these numbers would influence on later scenes. So, every gameplay sees the same pages and gets the same general results, but the character changes for future scenes.\r\n\r\nAnd it takes me to another crucial concept. Choices. At many ponts of the story, I faced that situation where the character would do THIS, leading to THAT. And I always had a choice in mind. The one which brings the story to the place I wanted. But what other choices could I give the player. I noticed I was having a hard time giving choices which actually were taking the character out of the story in mind. By taking a pause, I realized that most games including choices, tends to be about what the character does. Doing this or doing that. If the story is about going into the woods, why giving the option of going into the market, or the road or the castle?\r\n\r\nAt this point I realized choices are not necessarly about what the character is doing. It may be about how to do it. Or how it feels doing it. And I did dive into it. My whole story is far less about what the character is doind, but how it does these things, what it feels and what the character tells to others and to itself for taking those actions. So, expand the concept of choices. It would be about WHAT to do, or HOW to do or WHY to do.\r\n\r\nAnother important point is documenting and tracking everything. I work with a text processor to spell check my text. But it also contains my Logline, which is the games general description for I never lose the aim; it contains my charactres, their motivations and any relevant detail; and it contains a list of every single attribute, flag and piece of code the game uses, explaining where it goes, how the game uses and its purposes.\r\n\r\nWell... these are some things I learned by doing a little excercise. I hope it helps someone, somehow. ",
