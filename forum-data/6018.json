As you can see in the picture above, the spaces tend to get a little big. My reasoning is that I want to display who is present in the scene without it intruding in the text itself - the scenes are already long enough without the artwork stretching the page! <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->\n\nIs there a reasonable way to do this?",
