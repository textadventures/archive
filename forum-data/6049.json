I spend a few hours with the program and it's fantastic and easy to use.\nHere is my problem:\nI want to write a Gamebook i want to use on my Kindle with the Gargoyle-Player via KUAL launcher:\n[url:2ghlk18r]http&#58;//www&#46;fabiszewski&#46;net/kindle-gargoyle/[/url:2ghlk18r]\nGargoyle-Player supports Quest-formats .asl and .cad. I suppose these are older formats of Quest Vers. 4.x or older.\nAm i right? Is there any chance i can download an older Version of Quest that supports the .asl format?\n\nGreat thanks for your time and for this gorgeous program!\n\nZet",
