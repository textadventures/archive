I don't know how you plan to \"find some server code\" - each bit of server software is different as each bit of software is different, so any \"server code\" you find will probably just be the generic opening port stuff. I presume you're using the VB Winsock control so that really shouldn't be difficult (you can use the freeware Catalyst Socketwrench as an alternative - it's what I use for QuestNet Server) - implementing some kind of server protocol is something you'll have to do yourself.",
