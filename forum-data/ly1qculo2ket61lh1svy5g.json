I want to implement a command that checks the active room the player is in for attribute roomname.explorable , and if its True, allows the player to 'explore' to find random items. I don't want to have to do this command for each room, I'd prefer to be able to create some script to check if the active room the player is in has the attribute, regardless of the name of the room itself. Is there a way to do that? ",

Others include `HasScript`, `HasString`, `HasBoolean`, and `HasObject`. If you're looking at an attribute that might not have been set, you need to check that it exists before you compare it to anything.
