      "EditableText": "I don't think DLC has been done for Quest. The main question will be do you package it as a new game, or as a file that you load into an existing game. If as a new game, does the old game save out a data file that the new game reads in. And how does this all work with web play. I could be wrong but i think this is all uncharted territory, but doable. \n\nFor PC standalone, you'll have to bundle it yourself since Quest doesn't produce an exe. Quest will make a game file that's playable with the PC version of Quest, but I think the player has to have that installed, or you need to create the whole download. \n\nIt seems like it should be possible to have a stripped down version of Quest, just the player and not the game editor, but I'm not sure if anyone has done that. \n\nI appreciate you posting about this Top8, because one of my goals for this year is to have a clear process for things like this. So I'd be happy to join forces to do what needs to be done so everyone can then use this process in the future. But I'm a relatively new user like yourself, so hopefully some of the more veteran Questers and/or Alex will chime in here.",

Its my second time in Uni and this time its Business school. \n\nPeople with Quest experience will have insight I think. From what I can glean ... a game gets converted via the open source converter but the JS+HTML is messy coming out. The work required is at this step, provided we can't develop a set of pre-converter best practices that helps. So, this summer we could do something like:\n\nA - Develop a set of best practices for building a game in quest that converts as well as possible\n\nB - Document the issues with cleaning up the code post-conversion for an App (pre-phone gap)\n\nC - Document a process for packaging a PC Desktop version of the JS+HTML that is output (seems logical that we clean up the code already for phonegap, so this might be the best way to get a Javascript based PC application?)\n\n@George - I like the idea of a stripped down version of unity. \n\nD - Develop a set of best practices for easily adding content somewhere along the line post conversion (I am thinking we want to work with code once to update both the desktop and mobile apps - avoid working on multuple forks separately as much as possible though inveitably the desktop and app UX will probably mean some differences and thus double work.)\n\nThis is just off the top of my head. I don't think we need to change Quest at all - just learn and document the process of what we want to do. Doing it as quickly and efficiently as possible is the goal, of course, so this front end work would produce a guide that facilitates that goal.\n\nEDIT:  If we can't pull off true DLC we can just use versioning and expand each version with new content. Personally, I want to do closed code approaches - so I also need to figure out at least adequate ways of doing secure registration. I want to earn money by selling good games at great prices. \n\nThe agile development possible with quest is really exciting me these last few days. I am also working on an RPG so working out some really good common libraries that build on the excellent work already here would be great too. Gets all of us to market faster.\n\nPart of the point of really understanding the process is to make Kaizen possible - continuous incremental improvement to meet/exceed high quality standards. So the versioning approach not only allows expansion, it allows good QC. Ideally, the process also controls costs and preserves the capability of novice coders to produce quality finished digital goods.",
