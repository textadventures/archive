      "EditableText": "I just have two brief comments.  Fists about the display thing for injured.  I absolutely agree that it is cryptic but this was just a quick example I whipped off in twenty minutes.  If it were actual a game ready to be posted what I would do is remove the display part altogether.  I find things like that useful when creating a game so that I know what is going on when I test it out, but it is not necessary.  But if you want a display for this you could just start out with a string variable instead of a numeric on (I like numeric variables for some reason but that is my problem, not yours) or you could do as Alex suggests and use a function.  I also thought that what every you ended up with might be a lot more involved than just injured or not injured, especially if you use some kind of combat system like Ste suggests.  As I said this was just an example.\n\nSecondly about the examine thing.   Examine is a built in Quest function.  You seem to be trying to override it.  You can certainly do that but I donâ€™t see why.  You could just do something like:\n\n[quote:6ygzyn8o]\nexamine {\n\t\t\tif ( %injured% = 0 ) then msg &lt;You are in good shape.&gt;\n\t\t\tif ( %injured% = 1 ) then msg &lt;You are in pretty bad shape, you need medical attention as soon as possible.&gt;\n\t\t\texec &lt;inventory&gt;\n\t\t}\n[/quote:6ygzyn8o]\nThis would eliminate your â€œexamineâ€ or â€œxâ€ problem.  But if you still wanted to override the examine function you could just set up â€œxâ€ as a synonym of â€œexamineâ€",
