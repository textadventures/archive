      "EditableText": "Thanks Pertex and mrangel for the help, I was able to change the interface of the program so that it was in Spanish, and with that I changed the CONTINUE text and the compass directions.

My question is, where can I see the full list of commands? The compass stopped working because I think the commands were translated, and you can't find them in that text anymore, so I'll have to change it manually, but for that I have to know the exact commands.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to tell you that the Verbs were added by the creator of the game himself, at first he wanted to translate them by changing the following parameters: **Pattern, Attribute and Expression.** The creator of the game told me not to translate one of those 3 things to avoid mistakes, was it Attribute? If so, I will leave it as it was, and translate only the other two.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help.",
