Like, if they're in handcuffs, it would be IsWristsRestrained = true. \r\nI'd like to have the function checking what the player is wearing to see if any worn object has the attribute, in this example, wristrestraint = true or similar (easy to make one of the default attributes for wearables a boolean like that). Or, if I must, set up a script to assign the same flag to objects on game start, though that's a little more annoying.\r\nBut I can't seem to figure out how to have the game check worn objects for that attribute/flag. The closest I can get is checking every carried object, but that makes things difficult if they're just carrying a pair of handcuffs and aren't actually restrained. Any ideas how I can set this up?",
