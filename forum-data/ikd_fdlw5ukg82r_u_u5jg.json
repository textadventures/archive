      "EditableText": "I've made a few tweaks to the game submission process. The aim of this is to make life much easier for moderators, who are doing an amazing job despite being completely swamped by submissions.\r\n\r\nWe now ask a few questions, and the answer to each one determines what happens next:\r\n\r\n>**Who can access this game?**\r\n>- Only people I give the link to\r\n>- Everybody\r\n\r\n\"Only people I give the link to\" is the default, and corresponds to \"unlisted\". If you pick this option, there are no further questions. You can fill in the Description box, but it's now optional.\r\n\r\nIf you choose \"Everybody\", you get the next question:\r\n\r\n> **Is it finished?**\r\n> - Work in progress\r\n> - Ready for release\r\n\r\n\"Work in progress\" is the default. If you pick this option, there are no further questions. Description is optional. Your game goes directly to the new **Work in Progress** category - a moderator does *not* need to look at your game and move it there for you.\r\n\r\nIf you choose \"Ready for release\", you get the next question:\r\n\r\n> **Do you want to apply to put the game into a category?**\r\n> - No\r\n> - Yes\r\n\r\n\"No\" is the default. If you pick this option, there are no further questions. Description is optional. Your game goes directly to the **Sandpit** -  a moderator does *not* need to look at your game and move it there for you.\r\n\r\nIf you choose \"Yes\", *only then do you get to pick a category*. You can still choose \"Work in Progress\" and \"Sandpit\" from here if you like. If you choose any other category, then you *must* enter a description. The process is the same as before, i.e. your game goes into **Uncategorised** until a moderator checks it.\r\n\r\nIf you update your game and want to submit it to a different category (for example, you put your game in \"Work in Progress\", and now you've finished it, or your game was put in \"Sandpit\" by a moderator and you've finished/fixed/improved it), you can now do so - just edit the listing and answer the questions again. All the same rules as above apply.\r\n\r\nHopefully, by steering people to submit games to \"Sandpit\" or \"Work in Progress\" (where a moderator doesn't need to check them) unless the game is *really* ready, this will cut down on the amount of work moderators need to do. And by (finally!) allowing you to re-submit to a different category, games that do get finished eventually can be properly categorised instead of languishing unfairly in the Sandpit.\r\n\r\nAny feedback and questions are appreciated as always!\r\n\r\n**P.S.** \"Latest Games\" now sorts by *approval date* if one exists. This is the date that a game gets first approved into a non-Sandpit/non-WIP category. This means that if you've had a game unlisted or in Sandpit/WIP while you've been privately testing it, it will get a fresh date once it's approved to a category, so it won't disappear among old games.",
