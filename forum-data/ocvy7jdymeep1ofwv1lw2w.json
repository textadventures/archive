      "EditableText": "Welcome to Quest and making text adventure games! Here's some of my advice:\r\n1. Start a throwaway game. Just mess around, go nuts! While making this throwaway game, slink around the forums and tutorials to get yourself started. \r\n2. The forums are your best friend, just dive into them! If you have questions, feel free to ask! If you don't feel up to making a post, look around and there's a good chance that someone else has had the same problem and their question has been answered.\r\n3. Decide what you want to do with your game. You have several editors here, both online versions and downloads. Do you want to make something really long and complicated, at the cost of being unable to paste your game without requiring the Quest engine? Or would you rather go with Squiffy, where it's less complex but it is all in HTML and is easy to move? \r\n4. Take notes. Create a document or something where you can keep track of everything you're doing. Personally, I am using Ftsmind to create a flowchart and keep track of how I want my game to progress. Other programs are out there, if you'd like.\r\n4. Have fun! There is a learning curve, but once you've got the basics, you'll be flying through! \r\n\r\nI hope this is a helpful list, and I wish you luck on creating a game! \r\n\r\n-Ninjagorulz",
