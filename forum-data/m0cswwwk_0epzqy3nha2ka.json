      "EditableText": "> How would I be able to set the rank attribute using an integer?\r\n\r\nFor something like that, you'd normally have one attribute containing the integer, and one containing the string. So if you have an int called `rank_number`, you could create a script attribute called `changedrank_number` (which will be run every time the int changes), and make its code something like:\r\n```\r\nranks = Split(\"Trainee;Cadet;Officer;Corporal;Sergeant;Lieutenant;Captain;Major;Colonel;Brigadier;Admiral\")\r\nif (this.rank_number < 0) {\r\n  this.rank_number = 0\r\n}\r\nelse if (this.rank_number >= ListCount (ranks)) {\r\n  this.rank_number = ListCount (ranks) - 1\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  this.rank = ListItem(ranks, this.rank_number)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this case, it checks that the `rank_number` isn't negative or too high before changing the `rank` attribute to the appropriate rank name. (Note that when you make a list like this, the first rank on the list will correspond to rank_number 0)\r\n\r\nHope that helps.",
