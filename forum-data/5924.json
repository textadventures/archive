Most of what is written here on this subject is beyond my comprehension. I have managed to master a certain amount of script with help from this forum but am reluctant to proceed further if developments leave me unable to coipe. I have already asked elsewhere on the forum if there is any way of running quest games on the ipad but have had no reply. Help and or comments would be greatly appreciated before I continue.",
