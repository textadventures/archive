      "EditableText": "For a game I am working on I am interested in simulating time passing, but I don't want to use timers if at all possible. I was thinking of doing it by having each command take a certain amount of time (Which may vary).\nI need this mostly to progress parallel story lines the player may encounter in my world, and maybe change a few descriptions where it fits best.\n\nSo my question is this: What's the best way of doing this? Do I have to change each command to increase a variable or is there a way to process the input and depending on the type of command change the time variable in one place?\n\nThanks for your help.",
