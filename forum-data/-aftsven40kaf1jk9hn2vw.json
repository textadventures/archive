      "EditableText": "Hello all, quick general question. How do you feel about timers in a text adventure? \r\nOk so I have been working on a survival sim for some time and am now to the point where I really need input on the direction. Currently I have 5 timers, day&night cycle([W] Time/Weather/Seasons/Months, Temp Timer, shelter timer and cooking timers for burning wood stuff in forge and campfire, I also turned these into turn scrips. So I guess question is do you prefer turn scripts or timers?",

It's \"Simple Weather yada yada\" in the \"Library and Code Samples Forum\"\r\n\r\nI don't like timers except in very rare circumstances, the reason being is that the player should never ever be rushed to read quickly through an event either because you set the timer too short for them to read, or because the timer is too long and they have to sit there and wait. So the best way to substitute it in my opinion is a turn-script. \r\n\r\nSecond, as far as weather/TOD cycles, sometimes player's aren't going to be able to sit through however many hours of gameplay without having to stand or maybe do some quick chores, cook a meal, whatever. And if I was playing a game and one of the above occurred and I had to leave for a few minutes, I would be pissed if like...5 days went by, or it was clear and sunny and then turned stormy and deathly and my character was about to die because of it. \r\n\r\nTimers need to be used very, very carefully in a text adventure, and probably saved for like scenery like a grasshopper or bird cooing every 5-10 minutes.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Turn-scripts > timers. \r\n\r\nAnonynn.
