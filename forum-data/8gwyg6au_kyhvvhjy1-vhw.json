      "EditableText": "Hi, folks,\r\n\r\nI am using the webinterface of Quest because I am working on a macbook. For my game I needed to check if the player inventory is empty: I recreated the scene from Scott Adam's \"Adventureland\" where you can escape from the quicksand bog by swimming, but only if you are carrying nothing.\r\n\r\nSince the clickable script-interface did not help me I did some research and found a solution with the expression \r\n    \r\n    ListCount(GetAllChildObjects (player)) = 0\r\n\r\nwhich is True when the inventory is empty. The solution works fine as expected.\r\n\r\nMy question: is this there also a \"clickable\" solution or is my way the only way? I am a bit puzzled because I'd have thought that checking for an empty inventory is a regular thing in text adventures and that webinterface of Quest would provide a prepared attribute for that.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nNele\r\n",

It seems a logical thing to test for, but I can't think of any other game that uses that check. I can think of a couple where you have to have greater than or less than a certain number of items in your inventory; and slightly more where the weight of objects you're carrying is relevant. But then you've got other variations. Do you count the clothes you're wearing, if the game has clothes? If you're requiring the player to be carrying less than three objects, does a bell inside a box count as one object or two?

I think that the more options there are, the easier it gets for someone to overlook the one they need.\r\n\r\nProbably a personal preference thing; but I think Quest today has a reasonably good balance when it comes to the learning curve.\r\n\r\n(It would be nice if there was something like Excel's formula builder, if it still has that.
