      "EditableText": "Hey! I have started using quest again and have hit the same problem that caused my quitting last time: there are some things not able to be done or are too difficult to be done by people who use quest to get by the need of scripting language. My main question here is, how to edit custom attributes without telling the game to set the attribute. I tried to do a switch script and had fewer options than I liked so I switched over to using an &quot;If then&quot; and &quot;Else If&quot; system. The problem was, I kept getting an error. I don't remember what it was but it isn't important to me. What is is that there is some way to create a currency using custom attributes. I love quest and would love to see a way to have a money system separate from the score system. Also, if there is no fix to that, is there a way to rename score? I tried looking at the code view option but didn't find it in there either. Once again, I love quest and it would be nice if there is a solution to this problem.",
