      "EditableText": "Hi Awkwardudette ,\r\nSorry, I was a bit rushed this morning and didn't have time to do a step-by-step run through of the program and what you need to do your end to achieve the same result. So here goes and if you have any further questions, let me know:\r\n```\r\n1\tClick on the ‘player’ object in the game-tree on the left-hand side. \r\nClick on the ‘Attributes’ tab, click add on the ‘Attributes’ box (the third one at the bottom) and enter ‘stand’. Make this attribute a boolean and then set it initially to false.\r\nThe other items in the room are going to check against this attribute and enable us to open the door, and the curtains.\r\n2\tCreate another room, by clicking on the ‘Add room’ icon on the top of the screen and give it a name. Let’s call it ‘room2’ for now. Also create an exit from the original room to this new location.\r\n3\tIn the game-tree on the left-hand side, underneath the original room, you’ll see \r\n‘Exit: room2’. If you tick the check-box marked ‘Locked’, it will ask you for a name to unlock the exit later on in the game. Give this a suitable name, ‘Exit1’.\r\nChange the message ‘Print message when locked’ to something like, \r\n‘You need to get out of bed, you lazy thing.’\r\n4\tNow let’s create the bed. In the original room. Create the ‘bed’ object.\r\nGive it an appropriate look-at description; \r\neg. A nice, warm, double bed. It has lovely thick pillows and a feather-down quilt.\r\n5\tOn the ‘Verbs’ tab of the bed object, click the add verb button, and enter\r\nclimb out; get out\r\nHave it run a script, and choose ‘If’ from the menu.\r\nNow we need to choose ‘Object attribute equals’\r\nChoose the player as the object, enter stand, where it asks for the attribute, then enter ‘True’ in the last box. This then checks if the player is already standing.\r\nIn the ‘Then’ box underneath, have it print a suitable message \r\n‘You are already out of bed.’\r\n6\tIn the ‘Else’ box. Print message: ‘You get out of bed’\r\nSet a variable or attribute: player.stand = True\r\nUnlock exit: Exit1\r\n\r\nif (player.stand = true) {\r\n  msg (\"You are already out of bed.\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You get out of bed.\")\r\n  player.stand = true\r\n  UnlockExit (Exit1)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n7\tDo a similar Verb now for ‘climb in; get in’\r\n\r\nif (player.stand = False) {\r\n  msg (\"You are already in bed.\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You get into bed.\")\r\n  player.stand = false\r\n  LockExit (Exit1)\r\n}\r\n\r\n8\tNow for the curtains.\r\n9\tCreate the curtains object, and on the features tab, set it to be a container.\r\nSet the container type to be ‘Openable/Closable’\r\nScript to run when opening object:\r\nSelect the ‘If’ option.\r\nObject has flag. Select the player.

So here goes and if you have any further questions, let me know:</p>\n<pre><code>1\tClick on the ‘player’ object in the game-tree on the left-hand side. \nClick on the ‘Attributes’ tab, click add on the ‘Attributes’ box (the third one at the bottom) and enter ‘stand’. Make this attribute a boolean and then set it initially to false.\nThe other items in the room are going to check against this attribute and enable us to open the door, and the curtains.\n2\tCreate another room, by clicking on the ‘Add room’ icon on the top of the screen and give it a name. Let’s call it ‘room2’ for now. Also create an exit from the original room to this new location.\n3\tIn the game-tree on the left-hand side, underneath the original room, you’ll see \n‘Exit: room2’. If you tick the check-box marked ‘Locked’, it will ask you for a name to unlock the exit later on in the game. Give this a suitable name, ‘Exit1’.\nChange the message ‘Print message when locked’ to something like, \n‘You need to get out of bed, you lazy thing.’\n4\tNow let’s create the bed. In the original room. Create the ‘bed’ object.\nGive it an appropriate look-at description; \neg. A nice, warm, double bed. It has lovely thick pillows and a feather-down quilt.\n5\tOn the ‘Verbs’ tab of the bed object, click the add verb button, and enter\nclimb out; get out\nHave it run a script, and choose ‘If’ from the menu.\nNow we need to choose ‘Object attribute equals’\nChoose the player as the object, enter stand, where it asks for the attribute, then enter ‘True’ in the last box. This then checks if the player is already standing.\nIn the ‘Then’ box underneath, have it print a suitable message \n‘You are already out of bed.’\n6\tIn the ‘Else’ box. Print message: ‘You get out of bed’\nSet a variable or attribute: player.stand = True\nUnlock exit: Exit1\n\nif (player.stand = true) {\n  msg (\"You are already out of bed.\")\n}\nelse {\n  msg (\"You get out of bed.\")\n  player.stand = true\n  UnlockExit (Exit1)\n}\n\n\n7\tDo a similar Verb now for ‘climb in; get in’\n\nif (player.stand = False) {\n  msg (\"You are already in bed.\")\n}\nelse {\n  msg (\"You get into bed.\")\n  player.stand = false\n  LockExit (Exit1)\n}\n\n8\tNow for the curtains.\n9\tCreate the curtains object, and on the features tab, set it to be a container.\nSet the container type to be ‘Openable/Closable’\nScript to run when opening object:\nSelect the ‘If’ option.\nObject has flag. Select the player. Flag name ‘stand’.\nPrint an appropriate message. ’You open the curtains.’\nOpen object: object ‘curtains’\nIn the Else box print a suitable message: ‘You cannot open the curtains from in the bed.’\n\nif (GetBoolean(player, \"stand\")) {\n  msg (\"You open the curtains.\")\n  HelperOpenObject (curtains)\n}\nelse {\n  msg (\"You cannot open the curtains from in the bed.\")\n}\n\nDo a similar thing for the Script to run when closing object\n\nif (GetBoolean(player, \"stand\")) {\n  msg (\"You close the curtains.\")\n  HelperCloseObject (curtains)\n}\nelse {\n  msg (\"You cannot close the curtains from in the bed.\")\n}\n\n10\tGo to the curtains look at description:\nPrint a suitable message.\nIt might also be a good idea to have it state if the curtains are open or closed.\n\nThe curtains are a soft pink colour.\nThe curtains are {either curtains.isopen:open|closed}.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I hope you're able to follow this, and as I've said, any questions, feel free to ask.<br>\nWas trying to edit post to insert screenshots but unable to do so.
