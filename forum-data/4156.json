I'm old enough to have lived through the glory days of Adventure games, particularly ones written for the good ole Speccy (how I miss Level 9).  I've been on the IF scene since around 2004 and fairly active over at the ADRIFT forum.  Lost my interest over the last few years but I'm now sort of back now. I've seen a lot of talk about Quest recently and thought I would come and see what it is all about. I've just installed the developer and I'm starting to have a look.\n\nCheers\n\nRotter",
