My current Theory on why this is the case lies in the fact that I have my language set to german. If anyone has any Idea on how to fix this or if there is another way for me to Access said window or do something else that Substitutes its function, please answer, because I do not see any way my Story could reach a conclusion without the Player being able to give the Magazine to Grinölf.",
