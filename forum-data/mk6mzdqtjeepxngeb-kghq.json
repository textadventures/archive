      "EditableText": "about Boolean Attributes (true/false):\r\n\r\nI don't really like them being called as 'flags', as technically every/any Attribute is a 'flag/indicator', but the use of 'flags' goes to low level programming ('status/error/etc flags', though they're actually '0s' and '1s' integers, not Booleans: true/false, as Booleans/Strings/etc are higher level programming), but anyways... I'm digressing...\r\n\r\nBooleans are quite simple... here's an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (animal.is_lion_boolean_attribute = true) { // if (TRUE)\r\n  msg (\"OH SH!T!!!!!!!!! You hope you're faster than your buddy! Hey, it's you or him, being snack for the hungry lion!\")\r\n}\r\nelse if (animal.is_lion_boolean_attribute = false) { // if (FALSE)\r\n  msg (\"You enjoy watching the harmless and cute animal\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow, in quest, there's shortened (understood by quest) syntax for '=true', and also Booleans are dualistic (true:this thing or false: not this thing), so you can just do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (animal.is_lion_boolean_attribute) { // if (TRUE)\r\n  msg (\"OH SH!T!!!!!!!!! You hope you're faster than your buddy! Hey, it's you or him, being snack for the hungry lion!\")\r\n}\r\nelse { // if (FALSE)\r\n  msg (\"You enjoy watching the harmless and cute animal\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand, you can of course do the complement (opposite: negation: not) too:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (not animal.is_lion_boolean_attribute) { // if (FALSE)\r\n  msg (\"You enjoy watching the harmless and cute animal\")\r\n}\r\nelse { // if (TRUE)\r\n  msg (\"OH SH!T!!!!!!!!!

      "HTML": "<p>about Boolean Attributes (true/false):</p>\n<p>I don't really like them being called as 'flags', as technically every/any Attribute is a 'flag/indicator', but the use of 'flags' goes to low level programming ('status/error/etc flags', though they're actually '0s' and '1s' integers, not Booleans: true/false, as Booleans/Strings/etc are higher level programming), but anyways... I'm digressing...</p>\n<p>Booleans are quite simple... here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code>if (animal.is_lion_boolean_attribute = true) { // if (TRUE)\n  msg (\"OH SH!T!!!!!!!!!

Hey, it's you or him, being snack for the hungry lion!\")\n}\nelse if (animal.is_lion_boolean_attribute = false) { // if (FALSE)\n  msg (\"You enjoy watching the harmless and cute animal\")\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>now, in quest, there's shortened (understood by quest) syntax for '=true', and also Booleans are dualistic (true:this thing or false: not this thing), so you can just do this:</p>\n<pre><code>if (animal.is_lion_boolean_attribute) { // if (TRUE)\n  msg (\"OH SH!T!!!!!!!!! You hope you're faster than your buddy! Hey, it's you or him, being snack for the hungry lion!\")\n}\nelse { // if (FALSE)\n  msg (\"You enjoy watching the harmless and cute animal\")\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and, you can of course do the complement (opposite: negation: not) too:</p>\n<pre><code>if (not animal.is_lion_boolean_attribute) { // if (FALSE)\n  msg (\"You enjoy watching the harmless and cute animal\")\n}\nelse { // if (TRUE)\n  msg (\"OH SH!T!!!!!!!!!
