I can't figure this one out. I found an old post from 2004 but I'm not sure if it's outdated. It basically says to do this;\r\n\r\n```msg <#(quest.currentroom):look#>``` \r\n\r\nor (In QDK, put #(quest.currentroom):look# in the parameter for the print command).\r\n\r\nis this code still valid? I tried it and I get an error:\r\n\r\nError running script: Error compiling expression 'quest.currentroom': Unknown object or variable 'quest'\r\n\r\nI'm using Quest 5.8.",
