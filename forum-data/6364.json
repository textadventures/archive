So the first line in those sections would be:<br/><br/><pre><code><br/>    if (squiffy&#46;get(&quot;coffee&quot;) &lt; 1) {<br/>        squiffy&#46;story&#46;go(&quot;YouLose&quot;);<br/>    }<br/></code></pre><br/><br/>If coffee is &gt; 0, then Squiffy will ignore the &quot;story.go&quot; part, and go on with the rest of what's in the section.<br/><br/>Or . . . you could create a 'Master' section, and put that if statement only in the Master. Then the value of coffee is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">automatically</span> checked every time Squiffy goes to a new section.<br/><br/><pre><code><br/>&#91;&#91;&#93;&#93;&#58;<br/>    if (squiffy&#46;get(&quot;coffee&quot;) &lt; 1) {<br/>        squiffy&#46;story&#46;go(&quot;YouLose&quot;);<br/>    }<br/></code></pre>",
