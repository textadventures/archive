Then I made my first mistake - &quot;How do I change the world of IF and make games more fun!?&quot;.\n\nToday, I am sat writing this after wasting two weeks of jumping from one IF tool to another while trying to get &quot;words to catch fire&quot; or &quot;introduce a groundbreaking user input system&quot; - and there is nothing wrong with innovation of course, but this was misguided on my part.  Last night I decided to visit the marketplace on my phone and check out all of the IF on there.  To my &quot;surprise&quot;, there were many titles that featured nothing more than a black background, white text and hyperlinks that had around 50,000 downloads and good ratings.  Then it hit me - the writing (duh).\n\nSo I learned that, if your story is good, you are 90% there.\n\nAgain, nothing new to most people here but I write this for those who are (were), like me, putting good writing anywhere but top priority.\n\n(End of philosophical rambling)",

As an aside, one thing I've noticed from reading various forums is that writers/players of interactive fiction often seem to fall into two categories - those who prefer the 'interactive' aspect, and like challenging games that are primarily driven by logic problems and puzzles, and those who prefer the 'fiction' aspect, and like immersive games that are driven by the characters and plot, with puzzles having less of an emphasis. As a player, I tend to prefer games to tell a story, rather than be what essentially amounts to a book of riddles, and in this case, the quality of the descriptions and writing in general definitely seems to be an important thing.\n\nOn the other hand, in a game that is primarily puzzle-driven, or driven by other gameplay mechanics (e.g. hunger/thirst in survival games), I'd possibly argue that the quality and complexity of these puzzles or mechanics is more important than the actual literary quality of the writing itself.",
