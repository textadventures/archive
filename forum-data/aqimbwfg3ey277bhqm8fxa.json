      "EditableText": "Hey, first day trying this thing out. I think I got to handle the map very fast, but now that I have a few rooms in, I tried to make a room locked, with a key in another room the player has to pick up, then go to the room that is locked to unlock (duh, if it unlock at something like 50m away there's a big problem lol). \r\n\r\nSo, what I wanted to know, is that, as far as I'm concerned, I prefer using the \"if\" script, I found that varying scenarios is _much_ easier to handle via a \"if\" script, should make sense, giving scenes based on basically a yes or no condition is what they do anyway. But I'm getting sidetracked. So, I have my \"door\", which is just the exit, locked (can locking it only in one way mess things up?), and my key, which has to be in my inventory to let me pass through. \r\n\r\nIn a crude way, that's what I get : if player as no key, door is locked \r\nif player has key, door is unlocked \r\n\r\nI tried some variations, some ending closer to the goal, but in general, no luck in getting through the door. \r\nSo am I not using the correct script/combination of scripts? Or am I just missing something or not knowing in what tabs to put the scripts? \r\n\r\nOh right, also the tutorials about scripts really need an update, they barely helped at all. \r\n\r\nI could really use the help, the title's no joke, I literally got a headache, no more pc for tonight after I post this. \r\n\r\nThanks for at least reading. \r\n\r\nPs : also any tip about having corners only in the map? like west and north borders gone?
