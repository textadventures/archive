You are 100% correct.\r\n\r\nAlso, I forgot to mention the first problem.  I was using ```this```, so it was printing the added \"; nothing\".\r\n\r\nAfter I changed ```this``` to ```w.Ralph```, I noticed it added a duplicate mask to his modifier.\r\n\r\n> (because in the last link I can see to the game, you have this inside the function; if you fix that, it just adds a second copy of the doohickey) \r\n\r\nPrecisely.\r\n\r\nSo, now that we've established how confused I was from the beginning (hehehe, and still am), I must say that I don't know how ```list``` gets that modifier on it in the first place if that function's existence is what causes the duplicate issue.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that isn't the case.  I'm just confused as to how the name modifier works.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n>  it only modifies a local variable which is then discarded when it ends\r\n\r\nSnap!  I would have to at least return ```list``` to change the ```list``` which exists outside of that function; wouldn't I?  I'm a goof-ball.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> I would think that function should do nothing. \r\n\r\nI misinterpreted that.  I see now, though.\r\n\r\n...but I still don't know how ```nameModifierFunction``` works.\r\n\r\nI thought ```nameModifierFunction```had to push the function to ```nameModifierFunctions``` before anything would work.\r\n\r\nYou know what?  I've probably got some other code doing this, too, or something.  It's probably nothing to do with ```nameModifierFunction```.
