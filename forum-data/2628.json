I'm not sure what the best design would be - when you save a game, you create a &quot;.quest-save&quot; file, and this would need to be saved somewhere. But you don't want people writing arbitrary files all over the file system on your web server. Maybe you'd have the player logged in to your site, and store the save file in the database somewhere, so only the player that created it could access it. But at the moment WebPlayer knows nothing about logins, so there'd be a bit of work to do there first.\n\nThere is HTML5 Local Storage as another possibility perhaps - we could transmit the .quest-save file to the browser, and the browser could transmit it back when &quot;restoring&quot; an existing game.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated... especially if anybody fancies a nice meaty coding project to get stuck into!",
