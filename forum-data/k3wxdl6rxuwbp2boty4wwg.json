This is not as easy as it sounds, though this is a small game (and one that does not take itself very seriously). \r\n\r\nI have tested this, but there is only so far that one can go in testing one's own work. I should be grateful for feedback from anyone who would like to have a go at this game. Thank you in advance!",
