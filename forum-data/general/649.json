There is a tenth type for items/magic, which is \"MISC\"... which basically means \"anything that doesn't fit into the above types\" - but I don't see any monsters that aren't any of the above.\n\nNow, these are TYPES... Then you have different LEVELS in those types - so you can have a level 1 fire-bomb and a level 10 fire bomb... (but those numbers are infact 0 and 9) So that means 100 monsters just there... AND THEN you have monster numbers - basically so you can have 10 monsters on each level - so that makes 1,000 monsters in total.\n\nThere were a few reasons why it's limited to this:\n1) Quest only supports one-dimensional arrays... This is OK, but can you really make quest search for [010101] and not [111].\n2) The way quest makes arrays, is in a loop which has no \"do events\" code, so quest appears to freeze for about 2-3 seconds if you have an array over - IIRC - roughly 1000... So I don't want people to load up my library and have to wait for a few seconds just for the monster-array to load.\n3) Quest only handles numbers up to 35,000-ish anyway, so 999,999 is out of the question.\n\nI would never limit my users to such a low number as 10 monsters, but unfortunately only 10 per level (which I think is quite fine, seeing as how there aren't much more than 30 monsters-per-type in most games anyhow ).\nI do plan to make users specify certain monsters or a range across levels - BUT I think right now, I don't want the first release to be the end-all, put-on-the-highest-pedistal, library... Just something I can reach - which is as perfect as I can make it... (and that perfection is to do with quality of code/bug-free... Not features).",
