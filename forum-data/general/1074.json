Which I thought near impossible until I began to look into the information coming out from the console while Quest crashed and experimented with a couple of .dll's and Wine settings.\n\nHere's a pic:\n[url=http&#58;//www&#46;compwhizz&#46;freeserve&#46;co&#46;uk/linuxquest&#46;png:18sc5nsx]Linquest![/url:18sc5nsx]\n\nTo do this I did the following:\n\nInstalled Mozilla Firefox (which installs a new DCOM)... Flash 8 is a bitch that only works through Wine, and won't come to Linux till 8.5 or 9. (Windows 2000-mode)\nInstalled VB6... This prolly did nothing.. (Windows 98 Mode... also I set off the installer through winefile, as otherwise it wouldn't work correctly)\nAdded these 3 settings to the libraries tab;\nole32 (builtin,native) ... (This stopped Quest crashing on loading files - had some function Quest needs to initialise certain objects)\noleaut32 (native,builtin) ... (Allows pictures in Quest - most specifically the gif functions)\nriched32 (native,builtin) ... (This is some richedit textbox error, just after getting all the pics correct, Quest then tries to load up a textbox and falls out)\n\nI copied ole32.dll from a windows install (XP).. I'm sure you can get it off the net somewhere.\nI think that's all, but if you don't have the native ones for the others than download them.\n\nI then still found it was crashing but for some unknown reason... So I did this:\nWent back and changed it into Windows 2000 mode.. Why I thought of this I don't know, but it works! Perhaps it's something to do with the builtin functions that Wine emulates..\n\nAnyway, then it works!\nNow you can run your spiffy ASL code in Linux!
