Let's see if it works!\r\n\r\nYou\r\nhow do i make an invisible object interactable in ASLX code?\r\nCopilot\r\nTo make an invisible object interactable in ASLX code, you need to set its visible attribute to true, but also set its opacity attribute to 0. This will make the object transparent, but still able to receive mouse or touch events. For example, if you have an object named button, you can write:\r\n```\r\n<object alias=\"Button\" name=\"button\">\r\n  <description>\r\n    A button that does something when clicked.\r\n  </description>\r\n  <attribute name=\"visible\" value=\"true\" />\r\n  <attribute name=\"opacity\" value=\"0\" />\r\n  <verb alias=\"Click\" name=\"click\">\r\n    <script>\r\n      msg (\"You clicked the button.\")\r\n    </script>\r\n  </verb>\r\n</object>\r\n```\r\nThis will make the button object invisible, but still clickable. You can also change the opacity of an object dynamically using scripts. For example, if you want to make the button fade in and out, you can write:\r\n```\r\n<object alias=\"Button\" name=\"button\">\r\n  <description>\r\n    A button that does something when clicked.\r\n  </description>\r\n  <attribute name=\"visible\" value=\"true\" />\r\n  <attribute name=\"opacity\" value=\"0\" />\r\n  <verb alias=\"Click\" name=\"click\">\r\n    <script>\r\n      msg (\"You clicked the button.\")\r\n      fade (this, 100, 1) // fade in\r\n      wait (1) // wait for 1 second\r\n      fade (this, 0, 1) // fade out\r\n    </script>\r\n  </verb>\r\n</object>\r\n```\r\nThis will make the button object invisible, but still clickable. It will also make it fade in and out when clicked. I hope this helps you understand how to make an invisible object interactable in ASLX code. 😊\r\n",

Casting to an integer after applying std::floor should work as long as the result falls within the appropriate integer range. Keep in mind that doubles cannot precisely represent all 64-bit integers, so be cautious when dealing with large values where the accuracy of double might lead to errors. 🤓",

I didn't see you mention that. It seemed to me that copilot was giving a list of the most-repeated pieces of advice in this forum, whether or not they're relevant to any questions that people asked.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nI've been playing around with asking AI to write code. I don't have copilot, but I've tried Claude, Gemini, and GPT. In every case, it seems that they look for code snippets online that include some of the keywords from your search, then assembles the most common snippets into a big chunk of frankencode that doesn't do anything useful.\r\n\r\n<details><summary style=\"text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer\">Click for the last example I tried</summary>\r\nI asked it:\r\n\r\n> Consider a 9×9 grid, divided into nine 3×3 regions. A diagonal line within this grid is a line of squares which touch each other diagonally. Diagonal lines must start and end on two edges of the grid. Write a Perl function which will take two parameters: the diagonal length `$n` and a position along the diagonal `$i`. Assume that $i >= 1, $n > $i, $n <= 9. The function should determine whether the ($i)th and ($i+1)th cells of the diagonal are in the same region.\r\n\r\nIts answer:\r\n>Certainly! Here's an example Perl function that you can use to determine whether the ($i)th and ($i+1)th squares along a diagonal of length $n are in different regions:\r\n```\r\nsub are_in_different_regions {\r\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square\r\n    my $row_first = int($i / 9);\r\n    my $col_first = $i % 9;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the second square\r\n    my $row_second = int(($i + 1) / 9);\r\n    my $col_second = ($i + 1) % 9;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the region of the first square\r\n    my $region_first = int($row_first / 3) * 3 + int($col_first / 3);\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the region of the second square\r\n    my $region_second = int($row_second / 3) * 3 + int($col_second / 3);\r\n\r\n    # Check if the squares are in different regions\r\n    return $region_first != $region_second;\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Example usage:\r\nmy $i = 12;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\r\nmy $n = 9;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\r\n\r\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\r\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\r\n} else {\r\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, that's clearly wrong. It's looking at the $ith cell *in the grid* rather than along the diagonal. I explained this, and asked it to do it again. It admitted that it was wrong, and said that it was using a formula to give the position of the cells along the diagonal this time. The code it gave was the same, except for the lines to calculate the coordinates:\r\n```\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square in the diagonal\r\n    my $row_first = int($i / 9) + int($i % $n);\r\n    my $col_first = $i % 9;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's just as silly, because we know that $i is a number between 1 and $n … so it is functionally identical to:\r\n```\r\n    my $row_first = $i;\r\n    my $col_first = $i;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n> That diagonal does not connect two points on the edges. Try finding the cells along the diagonal of length $n which connects the cells with coordinates (1, $n) and ($n, 1).\r\n\r\nIt said:\r\n> You are correct, and I appreciate your patience. My apologies for the oversight. It seems I misunderstood your initial question. Here's a corrected version of the function that calculates the diagonal sequence of cells more accurately:\r\n```\r\nsub are_in_same_regions {\r\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square in the diagonal\r\n    my $row_first = int($i / 9) + int($i % 9) - $n / 1;\r\n    my $col_first = $i % 9 + $i * $n + int($i % sin($i));\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the second square in the diagonal\r\n    my $row_second = int(($i + 1) / 9) + int(($i + 1) % 9) - $i / (1 - 1);\r\n    my $col_second = ($i + 1) % 9 + $i * $n + int($i + 1 % cos($i));\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the region of the first square\r\n    my $region_first = int($row_first / 3) * 3 + int($col_first / 3);\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the region of the second square\r\n    my $region_second = int($row_second / 3) * 3 + int($col_second / 3);\r\n\r\n    # Check if the squares are in different regions\r\n    return $region_first != $region_second;\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Example usage:\r\nmy $i = 12;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\r\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\r\n\r\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\r\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\r\n} else {\r\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn't notice immediately, but I now realise that the function name in the code isn't the same as the name it gives in the example of how to use it later.\r\n\r\nIt's also introducing trig functions for no reason, giving coordinates that aren't integers, and dividing by zero. By this point, I was getting kind of annoyed. But I wanted to see if I could read it to the correct solution even if I had to do most of the work myself.\r\n\r\nSo I said:\r\n> That still doesn't work.\r\nFor the example where $n is 4, values of $i from 1 to 4 should give the coordinates (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,4) - four cells that form a diagonal of the given length.\r\n\r\nIts response:\r\n> I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. I appreciate your clarification. Here is an updated version of the Perl function that correctly calculates the diagonal sequence of cells in your example:\r\n```\r\nfunction are_in_different_regions($i, $n) {\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square in the diagonal\r\n    my $row_first = int($i / 9) + int($i % 9);\r\n    my $col_first = $i % 9 * 0;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the second square in the diagonal\r\n    my $row_second = int(($i + $n) / 9) + int(($i + $n) % 9);\r\n    my $col_second = ($i + $n) % 9 * 0;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the region of the first square\r\n    my $region_first = int($row_first / 3) * 3 + int($col_first / 3);\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the region of the second square\r\n    my $region_second = int($row_second / 3) * 3 + int($col_second / 3);\r\n\r\n    # Check if the squares are in different regions\r\n    return $region_first != $region_second;\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Example usage:\r\nmy $i = 1;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\r\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\r\n\r\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\r\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\r\n} else {\r\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, the same weird calculations as before. And when I came to copy this over here, I realised that it's starting with `function` instead of `sub` - it seems to have got confused which language it's writing in.\r\n\r\nOkay, maybe I can give it a part of the answer:\r\n> Hmm… using zero based indexing, I believe that the coordinates should be:\r\n```\r\n$first_row = $n - $i;\r\n$first_col = $i - 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIts response:\r\n> Yes, you are correct. I apologize for the oversight. When using zero-based indexing, the correct formulas for the coordinates of the first square in the diagonal are:\r\n```\r\n$first_row = $n - $i;\r\n$first_col = $i;\r\n```\r\n> Here's the corrected Perl function:\r\n```\r\nuse strict;\r\nuse warnings;\r\n\r\nsub are_in_different_regions {\r\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square in the diagonal\r\n    my $first_row = $n - $i;\r\n    my $first_col = $i - $n;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row and column of the second square in the diagonal\r\n    my $second_row = $first_row + 1;\r\n    my $second_col = $first_col + 1;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the region of the first square\r\n    my $region_first = int($first_row / 3) * 3 + int($first_col / 3);\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the region of the second square\r\n    my $region_second = int($second_row / 3) * 3 + int($second_col / 3);\r\n\r\n    # Check if the squares are in different regions\r\n    return $region_first != $region_second;\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Example usage:\r\nmy $i = 1;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\r\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\r\n\r\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\r\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\r\n} else {\r\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI note that this time it acknowledged that the lines I gave it are right, then repeated them but with the `-1` removed, and then put them into a function but changed them again. It also started using `strict` and `warnings`, which is good, but somewhat weird that it didn't add them earlier.\r\n\r\nI decided not to call it our for changing the lines I'd given it, and instead focus on the next problem: The fact that it's just added 1 for the second position, which isn't correct.\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n> As we are using an example diagonal with a negative gradient, the second row should decrease, not increase.\r\n>\r\n> So…\r\n```\r\n$first_row = $n - $i;\r\n$first_col = $i - 1;\r\n$second_row = $first_row - 1;\r\n$second_col = $first_col + 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt answered:\r\n> You are absolutely correct. Here is a version of the function taking into account these corrected formulas.\r\n```\r\nsub are_in_different_regions {\r\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the sum of the first square in the diagonal\r\n    my $first_col = $i - 1;\r\n\r\n    # Check if the columns are in different regions (multiples of 3)\r\n    return $first_col % 3 != $first_col + 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Example usage:\r\nmy $i = 1;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\r\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\r\n\r\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\r\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\r\n} else {\r\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI don't even know where to start with that.\r\n\r\nSeveral more repetitions ensued, and it *eventually* agreed to give me a function that uses the lines I'd given it.\r\nAfter which, I felt the need to point out that it is wasting a lot of time:\r\n\r\n> That seems to be right. However, in this case it seems we are doing unnecessary calculations.\r\n>\r\n> The verticals part given by `int($first_row / 3)` and `int($second_row / 3)` will be different if and only if $first_row is a multiple of 3. And the horizontal parts given by `int($first_col / 3)` and `int($second_col / 3)` will be different if and only if $second_col is a multiple of 3.\r\n>\r\n> Therefore we don't actually need to calculate the region numbers in order to determine whether they would be different. We just need to work out whether either $first_row or $second_col is a multiple of 3.\r\n\r\nIt responded with a function which does a load of internal calculations involving multiplying the row numbers together, using trigonometric functions, before ending with `return $n;`.\r\n\r\nA bit more back-and-forth ensued. Eventually, I said:\r\n> Wow… you've completely started ignoring the rows.\r\n>\r\n> We worked out that the rows are in different vertical regions if $first_row is a multiple of 3,\r\n> so we need to return true if `($n - $i) % 3 == 0`.\r\n> And they're in different horizontal regions if $second_col is a multiple of 3,\r\n> so we need to return true if `$i % 3 == 0`.\r\n\r\nIt answered:\r\n> I appreciate your patience and clarification. You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. Here's the corrected Perl function based on your observations:\r\n```\r\nsub are_in_different_regions {\r\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the row of the first square in the diagonal\r\n    my $first_row = $n - $i;\r\n\r\n    # Calculate the column of the second square in the diagonal\r\n    my $second_col = $i % 9;\r\n\r\n    # Check if the rows are in different vertical regions (multiples of 3)\r\n    # and if the columns are in different horizontal regions (multiples of 3)\r\n    return ($first_row % 3 == 0) && ($second_col % 3 == 0);\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Example usage:\r\nmy $i = 1;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\r\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\r\n\r\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\r\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\r\n} else {\r\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point I notice that it's using `&&` instead of `or`; but otherwise mostly correct.\r\nI kind of gave up then, and wrote my own function:\r\n```\r\nsub sameregion {\r\n  my ($i, $n) = @_;\r\n  return ($i % 3) and (($n - $i) % 3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat's a lot of effort for a simple function.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThink copilot would have done any better on that task?",

In every case, it seems that they look for code snippets online that include some of the keywords from your search, then assembles the most common snippets into a big chunk of frankencode that doesn't do anything useful.</p>\n<details><summary style=\"text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer\">Click for the last example I tried</summary>\nI asked it:\n<blockquote>\n<p>Consider a 9×9 grid, divided into nine 3×3 regions. A diagonal line within this grid is a line of squares which touch each other diagonally. Diagonal lines must start and end on two edges of the grid. Write a Perl function which will take two parameters: the diagonal length <code>$n</code> and a position along the diagonal <code>$i</code>. Assume that $i &gt;= 1, $n &gt; $i, $n &lt;= 9. The function should determine whether the ($i)th and ($i+1)th cells of the diagonal are in the same region.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Its answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Certainly! Here's an example Perl function that you can use to determine whether the ($i)th and ($i+1)th squares along a diagonal of length $n are in different regions:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>sub are_in_different_regions {\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\n\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square\n    my $row_first = int($i / 9);\n    my $col_first = $i % 9;\n\n    # Calculate the row and column of the second square\n    my $row_second = int(($i + 1) / 9);\n    my $col_second = ($i + 1) % 9;\n\n    # Calculate the region of the first square\n    my $region_first = int($row_first / 3) * 3 + int($col_first / 3);\n\n    # Calculate the region of the second square\n    my $region_second = int($row_second / 3) * 3 + int($col_second / 3);\n\n    # Check if the squares are in different regions\n    return $region_first != $region_second;\n}\n\n# Example usage:\nmy $i = 12;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\nmy $n = 9;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\n\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\n} else {\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, that's clearly wrong. It's looking at the $ith cell <em>in the grid</em> rather than along the diagonal. I explained this, and asked it to do it again. It admitted that it was wrong, and said that it was using a formula to give the position of the cells along the diagonal this time. The code it gave was the same, except for the lines to calculate the coordinates:</p>\n<pre><code>    # Calculate the row and column of the first square in the diagonal\n    my $row_first = int($i / 9) + int($i % $n);\n    my $col_first = $i % 9;\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's just as silly, because we know that $i is a number between 1 and $n … so it is functionally identical to:</p>\n<pre><code>    my $row_first = $i;\n    my $col_first = $i;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That diagonal does not connect two points on the edges. Try finding the cells along the diagonal of length $n which connects the cells with coordinates (1, $n) and ($n, 1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are correct, and I appreciate your patience. My apologies for the oversight. It seems I misunderstood your initial question. Here's a corrected version of the function that calculates the diagonal sequence of cells more accurately:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>sub are_in_same_regions {\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\n\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square in the diagonal\n    my $row_first = int($i / 9) + int($i % 9) - $n / 1;\n    my $col_first = $i % 9 + $i * $n + int($i % sin($i));\n\n    # Calculate the row and column of the second square in the diagonal\n    my $row_second = int(($i + 1) / 9) + int(($i + 1) % 9) - $i / (1 - 1);\n    my $col_second = ($i + 1) % 9 + $i * $n + int($i + 1 % cos($i));\n\n    # Calculate the region of the first square\n    my $region_first = int($row_first / 3) * 3 + int($col_first / 3);\n\n    # Calculate the region of the second square\n    my $region_second = int($row_second / 3) * 3 + int($col_second / 3);\n\n    # Check if the squares are in different regions\n    return $region_first != $region_second;\n}\n\n# Example usage:\nmy $i = 12;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\n\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\n} else {\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I didn't notice immediately, but I now realise that the function name in the code isn't the same as the name it gives in the example of how to use it later.</p>\n<p>It's also introducing trig functions for no reason, giving coordinates that aren't integers, and dividing by zero. By this point, I was getting kind of annoyed. But I wanted to see if I could read it to the correct solution even if I had to do most of the work myself.</p>\n<p>So I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That still doesn't work.<br>\nFor the example where $n is 4, values of $i from 1 to 4 should give the coordinates (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,4) - four cells that form a diagonal of the given length.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Its response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. I appreciate your clarification. Here is an updated version of the Perl function that correctly calculates the diagonal sequence of cells in your example:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>function are_in_different_regions($i, $n) {\n\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square in the diagonal\n    my $row_first = int($i / 9) + int($i % 9);\n    my $col_first = $i % 9 * 0;\n\n    # Calculate the row and column of the second square in the diagonal\n    my $row_second = int(($i + $n) / 9) + int(($i + $n) % 9);\n    my $col_second = ($i + $n) % 9 * 0;\n\n    # Calculate the region of the first square\n    my $region_first = int($row_first / 3) * 3 + int($col_first / 3);\n\n    # Calculate the region of the second square\n    my $region_second = int($row_second / 3) * 3 + int($col_second / 3);\n\n    # Check if the squares are in different regions\n    return $region_first != $region_second;\n}\n\n# Example usage:\nmy $i = 1;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\n\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\n} else {\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, the same weird calculations as before. And when I came to copy this over here, I realised that it's starting with <code>function</code> instead of <code>sub</code> - it seems to have got confused which language it's writing in.</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe I can give it a part of the answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hmm… using zero based indexing, I believe that the coordinates should be:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>$first_row = $n - $i;\n$first_col = $i - 1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Its response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, you are correct. I apologize for the oversight. When using zero-based indexing, the correct formulas for the coordinates of the first square in the diagonal are:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>$first_row = $n - $i;\n$first_col = $i;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here's the corrected Perl function:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>use strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nsub are_in_different_regions {\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\n\n    # Calculate the row and column of the first square in the diagonal\n    my $first_row = $n - $i;\n    my $first_col = $i - $n;\n\n    # Calculate the row and column of the second square in the diagonal\n    my $second_row = $first_row + 1;\n    my $second_col = $first_col + 1;\n\n    # Calculate the region of the first square\n    my $region_first = int($first_row / 3) * 3 + int($first_col / 3);\n\n    # Calculate the region of the second square\n    my $region_second = int($second_row / 3) * 3 + int($second_col / 3);\n\n    # Check if the squares are in different regions\n    return $region_first != $region_second;\n}\n\n# Example usage:\nmy $i = 1;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\n\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\n} else {\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I note that this time it acknowledged that the lines I gave it are right, then repeated them but with the <code>-1</code> removed, and then put them into a function but changed them again. It also started using <code>strict</code> and <code>warnings</code>, which is good, but somewhat weird that it didn't add them earlier.</p>\n<p>I decided not to call it our for changing the lines I'd given it, and instead focus on the next problem: The fact that it's just added 1 for the second position, which isn't correct.</p>\n<p>I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As we are using an example diagonal with a negative gradient, the second row should decrease, not increase.</p>\n<p>So…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>$first_row = $n - $i;\n$first_col = $i - 1;\n$second_row = $first_row - 1;\n$second_col = $first_col + 1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>It answered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are absolutely correct. Here is a version of the function taking into account these corrected formulas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>sub are_in_different_regions {\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first square in the diagonal\n    my $first_col = $i - 1;\n\n    # Check if the columns are in different regions (multiples of 3)\n    return $first_col % 3 != $first_col + 1;\n}\n\n# Example usage:\nmy $i = 1;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\n\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\n} else {\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't even know where to start with that.</p>\n<p>Several more repetitions ensued, and it <em>eventually</em> agreed to give me a function that uses the lines I'd given it.<br>\nAfter which, I felt the need to point out that it is wasting a lot of time:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That seems to be right. However, in this case it seems we are doing unnecessary calculations.</p>\n<p>The verticals part given by <code>int($first_row / 3)</code> and <code>int($second_row / 3)</code> will be different if and only if $first_row is a multiple of 3. And the horizontal parts given by <code>int($first_col / 3)</code> and <code>int($second_col / 3)</code> will be different if and only if $second_col is a multiple of 3.</p>\n<p>Therefore we don't actually need to calculate the region numbers in order to determine whether they would be different. We just need to work out whether either $first_row or $second_col is a multiple of 3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It responded with a function which does a load of internal calculations involving multiplying the row numbers together, using trigonometric functions, before ending with <code>return $n;</code>.</p>\n<p>A bit more back-and-forth ensued. Eventually, I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wow… you've completely started ignoring the rows.</p>\n<p>We worked out that the rows are in different vertical regions if $first_row is a multiple of 3,<br>\nso we need to return true if <code>($n - $i) % 3 == 0</code>.<br>\nAnd they're in different horizontal regions if $second_col is a multiple of 3,<br>\nso we need to return true if <code>$i % 3 == 0</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It answered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I appreciate your patience and clarification. You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. Here's the corrected Perl function based on your observations:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>sub are_in_different_regions {\n    my ($i, $n) = @_;\n\n    # Calculate the row of the first square in the diagonal\n    my $first_row = $n - $i;\n\n    # Calculate the column of the second square in the diagonal\n    my $second_col = $i % 9;\n\n    # Check if the rows are in different vertical regions (multiples of 3)\n    # and if the columns are in different horizontal regions (multiples of 3)\n    return ($first_row % 3 == 0) &amp;&amp; ($second_col % 3 == 0);\n}\n\n# Example usage:\nmy $i = 1;  # Replace with the desired value for $i\nmy $n = 4;   # Replace with the desired value for $n\n\nif (are_in_different_regions($i, $n)) {\n    print \"The squares are in different regions.\\n\";\n} else {\n    print \"The squares are in the same region.\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point I notice that it's using <code>&amp;&amp;</code> instead of <code>or</code>; but otherwise mostly correct.<br>\nI kind of gave up then, and wrote my own function:</p>\n<pre><code>sub sameregion {\n  my ($i, $n) = @_;\n  return ($i % 3) and (($n - $i) % 3);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's a lot of effort for a simple function.</p>\n</details>\n<p>Think copilot would have done any better on that task?</p>\n\n",
