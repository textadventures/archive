The Alpha-Verse technology calculates precisely what is needed; usually, the verse-jumper is required to do something fairly weird and ridiculous to accomplish it. A declaration of love to one’s enemy (said with feeling) or a sharp object being shoved up one’s butt are just a few of the strange situations the characters find themselves in.\"\r\n\r\n",
