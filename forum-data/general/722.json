It's a MMORPG, but it's played in a browser, sort of like Runescape, however, it's not graphical, it just uses text and forms.  You'll learn how to play it as you go along, and it's quite fun.  If you want to join up, make sure you go to [url=http&#58;//www&#46;stargatewars&#46;com/recruit&#46;php?uniqid=wu1110507438:21k4ie71]this page[/url:21k4ie71] in stead of the normal stargatewars.com.  I was hoping to recruit some of you, so we'll end up becoming a strong force.  The more people you have on your team, the better.  Once you've joined with the above link, i'll be your commander, but it doesn't mean much.  However, you can be a commander too, if you recruit others.  Hope to see you joining if you wanna play.",
