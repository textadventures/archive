Why FORCE a movie player to require a sound device in the first place?\n\nHow come Linux doesn't have a CENTRAL sound mixer? That would be so much easier for programmer AND user alike! one sound mixer in the midle between the hardware and the software trying to make sound.\nSure, ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) can be argued as such - BUT you can change it to others (OSS for instance.. I use a threaded one.. TOSS? something like that).\nFor some reason ALSA won't work at all.\nWhat's even worse is there IS no configuration for ALSA - unless you can find some text file somewhere..... No thanks, I'll change back into windows where I'm GARUNTEE'd that the sound and video is sync'd, and I can watch my movies.\n\n- Codec's is another issue. No central location of codecs on Linux... It would be so simple if you could have a program use a central codec base inside any Linux distro - each of which could be downloaded off of the net. These could be audio or video (or infact ANYTHNG).\nInstead each player wants to use it's own form of plug-ins, each version probably requiring different plugin versions.\nNot nice for the user to try and hunt down possibly non-existant plugins.\n\nI'll have to look into that midi player though.. My SoundBlaster midi output isn't supported - for some strange reason. I've tried every configuration I could and nothing's worked so far.\n\nXMMS can actually play MP3's out-of-the-box IIRC... Only thing is on Fedora you need to get a VERY old copy in .RPM format for it to install - after of course removing the previous install, and THEN after 'yum update' you need to remove it AGAIN and re-install... Because the thing won't compile.\nTHAT'S another thing... If you want someone to compile it, give them the damn files needed. I'm not saying you need to include them all in the same file - but giving DIRECT links would be GREAT, with the website afterwards... You always want to review the site before installing the stuff anyway. But hunting around sites for download links that require MORE browsing for download links are [b:nrdvejz5]BAD![/b:nrdvejz5]\n\n... Samba *sigh*.\nUntil recently, when I messed about with Samba alot, whenever I went into \"smb://\" it kept saying \"No workgroups availbable\"... Then, it wouldn't even see he workgroup Linux should have made. Now it doesn't see other PC's on the workgroup.\nI've looked at the raw packets, and there are major differences (like &lt;B&gt;&lt;L&gt; and stuff from Linux - but not Windows). As I say, Windows sees Linux just fine! It's Linux not listening to Windows when it says \"I'm here! Look-at-meLook-at-meLook-at-meLook-at-meLook-at-meLook-at-me!\".\nI've restarted it SEVERAL times, adjusted the ports to include 138 as well as 137 and 139. Listening to correct IP ranges, etc, etc, etc - add infinitum.\n\nAnd the RDP tool, is just a minor annoyance. It works all perfectly fine until you disconnect and then annoys you with a box saying the colours have been lowered - even though they weren't.\n- RDP's the only way I can see what's happening on my server PC. There's no monitor for it.\n\nSomehow, I don't think a \"./configure #stuff#\" then \"./install #other stuff maybe#\" is any faster than a double click, then going through the settings. Especially when - in the first instance - you need to read the settings every time for different configurations. In the second, options are presented and explained one by one.\n\nI agree Linux has some better models. The hard disk is but one of them (it's just starting to speed up actually - perhaps it's arranging the data into 'nice' parts). There's still loads to do though to get it more than 'working'.",

You always want to review the site before installing the stuff anyway. But hunting around sites for download links that require MORE browsing for download links are <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">BAD!</span><br/><br/>... Samba *sigh*.<br/>Until recently, when I messed about with Samba alot, whenever I went into \"smb://\" it kept saying \"No workgroups availbable\"... Then, it wouldn't even see he workgroup Linux should have made. Now it doesn't see other PC's on the workgroup.<br/>I've looked at the raw packets, and there are major differences (like &lt;B&gt;&lt;L&gt; and stuff from Linux - but not Windows). As I say, Windows sees Linux just fine! It's Linux not listening to Windows when it says \"I'm here! Look-at-meLook-at-meLook-at-meLook-at-meLook-at-meLook-at-me!\".<br/>I've restarted it SEVERAL times, adjusted the ports to include 138 as well as 137 and 139. Listening to correct IP ranges, etc, etc, etc - add infinitum.<br/><br/>And the RDP tool, is just a minor annoyance. It works all perfectly fine until you disconnect and then annoys you with a box saying the colours have been lowered - even though they weren't.<br/>- RDP's the only way I can see what's happening on my server PC. There's no monitor for it.<br/><br/>Somehow, I don't think a \"./configure #stuff#\" then \"./install #other stuff maybe#\" is any faster than a double click, then going through the settings. Especially when - in the first instance - you need to read the settings every time for different configurations. In the second, options are presented and explained one by one.<br/><br/>I agree Linux has some better models. The hard disk is but one of them (it's just starting to speed up actually - perhaps it's arranging the data into 'nice' parts). There's still loads to do though to get it more than 'working'.",
