Why is this a tool?\n\nPersonally, I suggest just two things:\nNotepad (winXP one... on 98/ME I suppose wordpad will do)\nAntechinus PHP Editor - this highlights PHP code and whatever, you can also get a nice start-up program to stop the pop-up's and whatever. This allows you to also run the code through a PHP parser on your machine to see the output...\n\nPersonally I use notepad and easyPHP 1.7 to save and run my PHP scripts on my machine locally - Notepad's quicker with larger files and is just much more simpler.",
