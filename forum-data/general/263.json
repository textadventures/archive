Whenever the form loads, it initializes the form's appearence, but stops on the last line of code.  It's says there should be an array, but there's no need for one.  I was wondering if one of the other guies who program in VB could take alook at the code and point out what's wrong with it.  I've uploaded the form to yahoo Briefcase so you can get it here: [url]http://us.flf.yahoofs.com/bc/2a9bcfa0/bc/My+Documents/Calculator+Form.frm?bfkXz4_A00nDc2ti[/url]\n\nI hope one or two of you can find the time to download it and take a look at it.  Thanks\n\nMatthew G.",
