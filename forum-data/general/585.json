The opening of multiple files - I think the dialog will allow you to select multiple files - not sure... Maybe there's a setting there somewhere.\nTo put it in the system tray (it is still the \"system tray\" in XP you know) you just set the option you used to remove it from the taskbar - it's 0 for none I believe, 1 for taskbar and 2 for system tray.... maybe... It puts the program icon into the tray.\nThose are pretty big-assed buttons... And not in the logical place I'd put them compared with the position slider.\n\nI wouldn't challenge ITID to make his own program - he'd probably do it just to spite you and make one that beat yours into the ground...

I guess winamp has more plugins, but still, I've never had a problem with WMP, and it suits me just fine.     -Ebayfan414",
