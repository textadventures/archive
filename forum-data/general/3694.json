But imagine if you want something more complicated. In Quest, you could create a command with a pattern like 'throw #object1# and #object2# at #object3#'. Then you could just add a script, so you can throw 2 things at a time.\nIn Inform 7, you're actually not allowed to do anything with more than two objects. It refuses to let you.\n\nAs for ADRIFT, I actually kind of like the way it sets up the locations. However, creating objects is a pain, as I couldn't find anything telling me how to put them in an actual location. I refused to go any further after that, so I don't know how the commands work there.\n\nThere's so much more things that you can do in Quest that you can't do in other systems (or at least, other programs make them more difficult) such as setting variables and functions that you can call later, editing the style of the text, or the style in general.
