Here's mine:\n\nAudacity 1.2.2: for all your audio recording and mixing\nOpenOffice.Org 1.1.3: For all you document and spreadsheet needs\nMozilla Firefox 1.0: The greatest web browser ever\nWinAmp 5: A media player that's nearly as good as WMP (Not that I use it (yet!))\nZipGenius 5.1: A great zip program that supports formats like zip, cab, rar, czip (cryptozip), and plenty more.\nXviD: The opposite of the XviD AVI encoder, it's the open source version.\nand last but not least, MPlayer v4: How could I not include this?  It's mine!\n\n[EDIT] This seems like the right topic to put this in: does anyone know how to make plugins for Firefox?",
