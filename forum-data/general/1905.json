It's design was based around the realization that we can make Eselo as unique as we like because we are not here to target the masses. Having this in mind, Eselo was/is being designed to bring a feeling of a true RPG in combination with an online experience. On top of that, still knowing that we have the ability to target whatever audience we would like, it is much more elaborate in its design. Some might interchange elaborate with more difficult, as I could agree to that myself. It's not a cake-walk similar to the majority of these sandbox engine-produced games. A serious aspect in such a leisure form of ORPG creation? Yes. Because I did not find my effort, nor my team's effort, leisure. I hate to be so general, but any exacts may ruin the experience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b:3ex43hgj][color=#000080:3ex43hgj]Why?[/color:3ex43hgj][/b:3ex43hgj]\nI decided to start the project here after several engines in the past have failed me. I obviously was able to carry over my ideas, so getting a start here was not too difficult.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b:3ex43hgj][color=#000080:3ex43hgj]When?[/color:3ex43hgj][/b:3ex43hgj]\nEselo still has much work to go. Although, we have made an immense amount of progress thus far. Such as the GUI, so close to finished. Tiles/Sprites completed. Content/design always growing, but foundation is by far finished. Etc. I do not have an estimated time of release.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b:3ex43hgj][color=#800000:3ex43hgj]In-Game Preview[/color:3ex43hgj][/b:3ex43hgj]\n\nI'll try to give a brief amount of commentary with each screenshot.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b:3ex43hgj][color=#BF0000:3ex43hgj]The oh-so Alluring Poster[/color:3ex43hgj][/b:3ex43hgj]\n[img:3ex43hgj]http&#58;//img65&#46;imageshack&#46;us/img65/3938/posternu1&#46;png[/img:3ex43hgj]\nIt's trying to encourage nearby villagers to settle uncharted lands.
