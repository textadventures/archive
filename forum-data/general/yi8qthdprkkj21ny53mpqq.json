So not sure if this is the correct place to post but I tried going through the help and looking for a support thread but can't find any anywhere for this site.\r\nSo I'm trying to access a text game that requires me to verify my age in my profile. Every time I do this and update it \"successfully\" and then try to access the game again it says I need to verify my age in profile. I click update profile info and my age is blank. Despite getting the message each time that my profile has been successfully updated, if I go back it's blank. Anyone know what I'm supposed to do?",
