So I was thinking about either # (1-X) + N = Y # or # (1 / X) * N = Y # o that you get a rounder curve and it means there's a sharp rise either at the beginning or end... Preferably the beginning... Oh yeah, and were I put X I would also put X^2 or X^3 or whatever...\n\nNow I can't remember the graphs offhand, but am guessing the 1/X one never reaches 1, goes through zero - kinda like the tan graphs?\nAnd the 1-X graph is just a negative graph of the X...\n\nErm, also, what do you think of natural log (logarithm)? Which is somewhere between X^2 and X^3 (if you didn't know)...\n\nI don't want the weapon's too far apart but not too close either....\nMaybe a simple line but steeper? X/2, X/3 ??\n\nOh, and just to stop me writing out a PM or whatever... Alex:\nI haven't been on ICQ so my account's probably been deleted... I also lost your account anyway - so, would you please add me to your MSN list - or give me your contact? I would like to chat sometimes, but never really bother to ask...

      "EditableText": "Wouldn't be easier just to assign weapons their strength according to what they are?  If you use a function correlating it with price, you may come out with wierd results.  For example, lets say a simple axe is 20 gold, but a sword is 40 gold.  Well, it doesn't really make sense to say that an axe does less damage than a sword.  I would actually consider just assigning damage to each weapon yourself, unless you're planning on having like 30 different weapons in the game, which would, in my opinion, be outrageous.  Just my 2 cents worth.",
