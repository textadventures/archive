This means all Quest games, including existing games for Quest versions 1 to 5, run without a server-side component. They're interpreted by the web browser, making them much quicker. The runner will also be packaged into a cross-platform app, so you'll be able to play all Quest games on Windows, Mac and Linux.\n</code></pre>\n<p>It was my understanding that the whole point of the update was that games would be saved as html files (in the same way Twine games are) and could therefore be hosted on any games site.</p>\n<p>But is this not the case?

Parchment, that you asked about a while ago, is one example, that takes Z-Machine games.
