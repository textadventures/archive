The CBT test is around Â£95 at the most, for 1 day of training.  If I pass (And I know I will) I can ride anything up to 125cc on learner plates.  The only bad thing is that I can't ride on motorways, but this is only to get me from A to B around Blackpool.\n\nSo, within 1 week, I will have passed a CBT test and already started riding a bike.  If you don't want to start on a bike, you can start on a 50cc scooter or something.  The only thing is, my insurance will be something about Â£1600 a year, which is roughly Â£160 a month, and then there's tax on top of that.\n\nThe bike itself cost me Â£1000 from a dealer from Wigan which I found on eBay.  There are cheaper bikes, second hand, but look really nice.\n\nAll I need to do now is just ride that thing until I feel completely confident about riding a bike, then take my proper test and maybe move up to something bigger.",
