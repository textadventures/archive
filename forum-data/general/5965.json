Now I work with emulators of computers from the eighties. Mainly I program adventures in BASIC.\nI am very interested in Quest and what I will read here. First I will take a little time to look around here.\n\nFurthermore: I'm Dutch and working for the government in the Netherlands. The adventures I write are in the English-language, because I'm used to it. Dutch-languaged adventures, hmmm, I little childish, I think.",

Also, feel free to use the Quest Tutorial and Templates &quot;game&quot; that I just published.  My biggest worry is how user friendly it is.  I'm concerned how it will be received.  I'd appreciate it if you could give your opinion of it.  It is largely an editor tutorial, not a code tutorial, so I'm not sure how much use it might be to you (it sounds like you know code).  Also, I ain't too proud to beg, or throw out a shameless plug for my games.  I think they are pretty good but seem to have flown under the radar like many other decent games out there.  If you play text adventure games as a hobby, I'd appreciate it if you gave mine a try!\n\nOh, and while making games with Quest, if you run into any problems you are having trouble solving, be sure to ask on the forums - it's a relatively small community but it is a very helpful one!\n\nAnyway, glad you've found Quest.  I hope you enjoy it!\n\nXanMag",
