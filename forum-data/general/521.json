      "EditableText": "As I said in the 1 or 2 post nobodies thread, I have written a program called MPlayer that will play music. It is a small app, unlike WMP 7.1 (I run Win 98, which means no v9 or v10). You can find the latest release (but certaintly not the most up-to-date) version at winsite.com by searching for Music Player.\n\nHowever, I have had a big big problem with the code that sets the currrent position in the code. I'm using the WMP 6.4 (or similar) control that I found on the computer (beats me why I can't find v7.1). Anyway, at first, I just had it use a basic counter, so that there were no minutes, just seconds.\n\nA couple of weeks later I wrote a huge spiel of code, which did the job, except it didn't increment the minutes when it should have. This code used an If/Else Statement that subtracted a certain value depending on what the value was, and a select case statement, one for each number from 0-60 inclusive. It was also now in a timer.\n\nJust tonight, I had my dad look at the code (him having written quite a lot of BASIC programs in the past), and we refined it to about 10 lines. It looks fine, but it just stays at 0:22 no matter what time it is at. It is still in a timer.\n\nI want to publish the sourcecode in the timer here, but I'm not sure, as I'm thinking of one day full on releasing it like Microsoft did with WMP. So, I've decided that anyone who is willing to help me (seriously) will have the code emailed to them. They can then email me back. This is to avoid a public release of this code. Afterall, you're hardly likely to find the sourcecode for WMP 10 lying around on the Internet (legally, of course), now, are you?\n\nThanks to anyone who can help. I know my email says <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:007bond@aurora-mail.com\">007bond@aurora-mail.com</a><!-- e -->, but I'm not sure if all email is actually being delivered there, so if you are going to help, email me @ <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:castle_ofdoom@yahoo.com.au\">castle_ofdoom@yahoo.com.au</a><!-- e -->",
