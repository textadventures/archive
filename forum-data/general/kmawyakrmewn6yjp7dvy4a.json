      "EditableText": "You are really close, and the answer is more simple than you might imagine. The problem here is that whenever the player is over 120, it is _also_ over 110, so it defaults to the first else if statement. Here is what you need to do to fix it: \r\n\r\n````\r\nif (player.weight = 110) {\r\nmsg (\"\"Looking good, all that hard work at the gym really paid off.\"\")\r\n}\r\nelse if ((player.weight > 110) and (player.weight < 120)) {\r\nmsg (\"\"Crap! These pants must've shrunk in the wash.\"\")\r\n}\r\nelse if ((player.weight = 120) or (player.weight > 120))  {\r\nmsg (\"\"I can't believe Mom and Dad still havent noticed my gut, guess I'll just have to stuff myself even more!\"\")\r\n}\r\n````\r\nNow, the limits for each else if statement are defined. The first else if would be read as, \"Whenever the player is more than 110 units of weight, AND less than 120 units of weight, print a message (this is a range of 110 to 119).\" The second one is read as, \"Whenever the player is equal to 120 units of weight, OR they weigh more than 120 units of weight, print this message.\" Quest knows when to give up on the first and switch to the second.
