I'm just curious how many of you think it would be a nice addition to the game archive to show the amount of times a game has been downloaded.  \nIf anyone has been to sites where you can download different types of software, you are familiar with the column for that.  Honestly, good or bad review, regardless...I personally sometimes sway towards a file that has been downloaded more times.

Maybe what the site needs is an author login thing (like Winsite), which lets them see how many times their program has been downloaded, how many times the infocard has been viewed, when they uploaded it, etc.  Of course Quest might not need everything, but you get my drift.",
