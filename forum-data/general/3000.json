(sorry for my English)\nFor the past days I am searching thru internet to find a text adventure engine to use.\nI am slowly turns towards quest because it's the easiest engine to translate to an not Latin language. Also I really like the contraction of the aslx cause the xml type format makes it easy to subtract data and use perhaps in another engine.\n\nI am not done reading the documentations right now but I have to say that I am little bit disappointed with the interpreter.\nThe reason is the server and ajax approach. At least for the player in my perspective there must be a client based javascript implementation. This way quest player will be a real cross platform. Everyone will be able to download and run the html file and have a quest player. \nAt first when I found out that quest can have a webplayer and that it can communicate with javascript I thought that you set your game world thru aslx and code(script) it with javascript. And I said to myself this is the way to go for a if engine. But I was wrong.\nI don't wand to be judgmental but it looks like quest missed the opportunity to be the if of the internet.",
