A few days ago I stumbled accross Kings Quest VI in a second hand shop, I have been wanting to play it for years... So I dug out an old computer that would still run system 7 (Mac) and set about installing it. Unfortunately it looks like I am short a disk!! I have 8 disks and it is asking me for disk 9... does anyone know where I might be able to find such a thing?! Anywhere that maybe I can download it ...or something??\n\nARGGH! HELP!!\n\n-Alice",
