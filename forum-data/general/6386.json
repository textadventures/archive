But for example, you've seen my game for example, Pix --- there are A LOT of variables. I don't want to give the player a code at the end that looks like this... 48923048490348293402482904284924839420839480238492048290 ...Of course, if that's the only way to do it then I guess that's fine. \n\nBut what I find most annoying is how the save systems work. For example, if someone plays a game and then it gets updated --- that person now has to start completely over...and must restart each time an update becomes available. So why not just change how the saves work so that they can be reused for games that are frequently updated. This would also likely solve the Episodic Format as well. Now given I'm a noobie programmer (if you could even label me as that lol) maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about. But to me, something is fundamentally flawed about the way the Quest system saves progress and/or the way it has a 20mb limit.\n\nMaybe the save system should work like you suggested, Pix.

But still it really is silly to save the game the way it does. Maybe it should be based off the game-code or I dunno implementing what Pixie mentioned but instead of it being for episodic releases it could be based on current stats/variables in the room that the player is currently standing. I mean not only that, but it would cut down A LOT of giant save file sizes. \n\nThere has to be a better way to go about it. I mean, I'm getting a little worried myself because my game is reaching 6mb and I have NO sounds or pictures added yet (save for the title) and I only have one area partially written into the game. I estimate that by the time I finish that one place, it'll be closer to 7-9mb!! That's just about half the file-size that Quest allows for publishing! And the rest of the game is going to be much larger in scope @_@",
