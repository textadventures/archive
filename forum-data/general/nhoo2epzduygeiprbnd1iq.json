If you link to the game directly, visitors don't need to know they're getting content from another site.\r\nCons: If the server has stability issues it will make your game unresponsive. If you link directly, it won't be possible to resume a saved game.\r\n\r\n* Install Quest on your own server.\r\nPros: Players don't have to leave your site. When a new version of Quest is released, you can test that it works properly with your game before upgrading the server.\r\nCons: Probably needs a dedicated Windows server, which is likely expensive. The server side code isn't extensively documented, and I've heard that it's difficult to install and maintain.",
