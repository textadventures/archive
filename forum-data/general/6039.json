Then I got thinking about what the opposite of &quot;mouth&quot; was in terms of the digestive tract, and well... we don't need to go there. \n\nBut I wonder if it helps to look at it more of the cave/tunnel exiting out of a sheer cliff vs entering there in terms of your situation, especially if it is a cave as opposed to the end of a tunnel (since it's really more about getting out).",
