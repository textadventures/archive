      "EditableText": "Well I dropped the prices for my existing games down to half of their original cost. Maybe AUS$1.99 is asking too much. On Android Developer Market it seems the lowest I can go is AUS$0.99 so I have set them all for this price. This is for:\n\n* Moonbase 3\n* Mystery of the Dark Manor\n* The Ice Guardian\n\nIn addition I have released the Time Traveller. This was a game I did with my dad on the Amstrad CPC464 using the Graphic Adventure Creator, or GAC as it was commonly known then. We did 3 games in total using the GAC.\n\nThis particular one was done in 1988.\n\nBack then, due to memory constraints, we couldn't provide pictures for every location like what my dad could do with the 3 above games already released to Android (they were released later on the more powerful Amstrad CPC6128). As such about 66% of the images are unique.\n\nA whole new generation of people are now playing text adventure games. As such people may find this one easier than the others already released.\n\nWell if you get a chance the demo is here: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=time.demo\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=time.demo</a><!-- m -->\n\nThe complete version for AUS$0.99 is here: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=time.Complete\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... e.Complete</a><!-- m -->\n\nIf you do get a chance to play, hope you enjoy it!\n\n\nMark Eaton",
