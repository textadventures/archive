I tried to do safe mode but that doesn't either work. The technical support guy didn't help. He said it's probably a corrupt file, which I have no clue how I could have gotten anyway. It's Windows XP Home Edition, by the way. So I called up a few computer repair specialists, and they said that they could probably fix it, and they had heard of that before. One said that it's probably missing a driver. But I can't bring it in, as I don't have the cash right now. However, I have lots of info that I NEED, including some of the quest things that I have made, and can NOT lose it. Has anyone heard of this, and do you know how I can fix it? I would REALLY appreciate it.",
