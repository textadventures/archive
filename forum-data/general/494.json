Alot of people who can't code, like me, would really like to make their own game.  M:RPGE allows you to do so.  Like playerworlds, M:RPGE allows you to host your own online 2D graphical game (Only ours is already 100 times better).\n\nIt has name and text colour support for staff, pets, guilds, in-game mapeditor/npc editor/shop editor/spell editor etc.  It allows you to import 20 tilesheets so you can use them all in just one map!.  It has player biographies, paths, AD&amp;D statistics (str, int, dex, cons, wis, cha), prayers, spells (and soon skills for archers, warriors etc.!)\n\nThe engine will be skinable, so you will be able to change things around as you please.  No coding is involved at all.  You will be able to put in your own tiles and sprites, music and sound, and graphics.\n\nI will post screenshots when i've done the default graphics for it.",
