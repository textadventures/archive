Can styles sheets be used to format text, images, page layout and should they be created in a certain way or location. \r\n2. In the game I am trying to create I would like to give the player a number of hidden attributes the value of which will effect the game. eg  if the player is drunk or taken drugs he will see things differently.\r\nor if the player is cursed he may be affected differently in the game, but I don't want the player to see the attribute.\r\nThanks for any help",
