I don't know coding, but I used to use the QDK program. I stopped because of college, work, and no time in general.\n\nI was looking through an old computer earlier, and found an unfinished game that I had started 2 years ago. It reminded me how much fun this was, and I kinda want to start using QDK again, but I really don't have the time. Anyway, since you can't post Demos here, I uploaded the zipped file to savefile.com where you can download it and try it out. (Savefile is free, of course.) I think it was going to turn out pretty cool, or at least better than the games that I remember seeing on here, but maybe I'm biased, lol.",
