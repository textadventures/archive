      "EditableText": "OK.  I suppose that I am the one who brought this word to the forum.  I will make it clear so that you all understand what a sycophant is.  This is from Wikipedia.\n\n[quote:3332x9ww]Sycophant (Gr. &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#951;&#962;), in ancient Greece was the counterpart of the Roman delator, a public informer.\n\nAccording to ancient authorities, the word (derived by them from &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959; suko, &quot;fig&quot;, and &#966;&#945;&#957;&#951;&#962; fan&#275;s, &quot;to show&quot;) meant one who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion. The Oxford English Dictionary, however, states that this explanation, though common, &quot;cannot be substantiated&quot;, and suggests that it may refer instead to the insulting gesture of &quot;making a fig&quot; or to an obscene alternate meaning for &quot;fig&quot;.\n\nAnother old explanation was that fines and taxes were at one time paid in figs, wine and oil, and those who collected such payments in kind were called sycophants because they publicly handed them in.\n\n[b:3332x9ww]Thus the term has come to mean one who seeks to please people in positions of authority or influence in order to gain power themselves, usually at the cost of pride, principles, and peer respect[/b:3332x9ww].[/quote:3332x9ww]\n\nPerhaps by understanding this some of you will better understand what I have been saying about Davidw.  \n\nI have been unjustly accused of plagerism (cut and paste) with regard to a post I made the other day.  I was so shaken by the attacks that were set out against me that I didn't even come here and post yesterday.  Admittedly, i did look round but I refrained from posting due to the fact that I would have been way off-base had I done so.  \n\nI suspected that the post would draw a certain measure of cynicism from some members.  I do, however, irregardless of any such cynicism stand behind every word.  Sometimes in order to draw a point about something it comes necessary to draw it in the abstract.  This challenges the reader to look between the lines and in my opinion as the author of such prose is an example of taking the moral high road where others would only insult and belittle the subject of said diatribe with petty indiscretions and personal judgements.\n\nI would opine that to further subject Davidw to such rhetoric and innuendo will serve no purpose other than give him fodder for his ever-loaded cannon of drive-by insults.  One can only take so much, after all.  I for one am simply not standing for any more.\n\nSo Davidw, you are quite free to go on quoting me out of context to your little friends on other forums and have a big laugh about it.  I am sure that you and your merry band of SYCOPHANTS both here and in those other places are having plenty of fun making judgements and drawing conjecture around me.  I would like to know what these other forums are BTW so that I might have the chance to defend myself further against your insidious attacks.  I doubt that you have the courage to tell me though, you pathetic coward.",

      "HTML": "OK.  I suppose that I am the one who brought this word to the forum.  I will make it clear so that you all understand what a sycophant is.  This is from Wikipedia.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Sycophant (Gr. &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#951;&#962;), in ancient Greece was the counterpart of the Roman delator, a public informer.<br/><br/>According to ancient authorities, the word (derived by them from &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959; suko, &quot;fig&quot;, and &#966;&#945;&#957;&#951;&#962; fan&#275;s, &quot;to show&quot;) meant one who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion. The Oxford English Dictionary, however, states that this explanation, though common, &quot;cannot be substantiated&quot;, and suggests that it may refer instead to the insulting gesture of &quot;making a fig&quot; or to an obscene alternate meaning for &quot;fig&quot;.<br/><br/>Another old explanation was that fines and taxes were at one time paid in figs, wine and oil, and those who collected such payments in kind were called sycophants because they publicly handed them in.<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Thus the term has come to mean one who seeks to please people in positions of authority or influence in order to gain power themselves, usually at the cost of pride, principles, and peer respect</span>.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Perhaps by understanding this some of you will better understand what I have been saying about Davidw.  <br/><br/>I have been unjustly accused of plagerism (cut and paste) with regard to a post I made the other day.  I was so shaken by the attacks that were set out against me that I didn't even come here and post yesterday.  Admittedly, i did look round but I refrained from posting due to the fact that I would have been way off-base had I done so.  <br/><br/>I suspected that the post would draw a certain measure of cynicism from some members.  I do, however, irregardless of any such cynicism stand behind every word.  Sometimes in order to draw a point about something it comes necessary to draw it in the abstract.  This challenges the reader to look between the lines and in my opinion as the author of such prose is an example of taking the moral high road where others would only insult and belittle the subject of said diatribe with petty indiscretions and personal judgements.<br/><br/>I would opine that to further subject Davidw to such rhetoric and innuendo will serve no purpose other than give him fodder for his ever-loaded cannon of drive-by insults.  One can only take so much, after all.  I for one am simply not standing for any more.<br/><br/>So Davidw, you are quite free to go on quoting me out of context to your little friends on other forums and have a big laugh about it.  I am sure that you and your merry band of SYCOPHANTS both here and in those other places are having plenty of fun making judgements and drawing conjecture around me.  I would like to know what these other forums are BTW so that I might have the chance to defend myself further against your insidious attacks.  I doubt that you have the courage to tell me though, you pathetic coward.",

Wake up man..<br/>... I'm now trying to imitate the animal in it's own language, perhaps then it'll understand me.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>You posts are suggesting alot of anger towards me.</p></blockquote>Yes. Idiots really annoy me.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>You should distance yourself from davidw he is poisoning your mind.</p></blockquote>And what has it got to do with him?<br/>If I become any more distant from him I'll be on the dark side of the moon. The only interaction we have is here, in plain sight for everyone to see. I've recieved about 6 PM's from him in 4 years or so. 3 maybe 4 in the last couple of months.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Yes you do edit all my posts and try... I say try to make me look bad.</p></blockquote>Oh je-sus. Go on, search for all the posts made by YOU, that have &quot;Tr0n EDIT&quot; in them..<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Don't stray to the dark side Tr0n</p></blockquote>Yes. Because the world is white and black, we're all on a chess board and we try to attack each other in any way we can!<br/><br/><blockquote><p>davidw is trying to lull you into doing his dirty work</p></blockquote>Yes, that's it.. He's somehow hacked into my machine and placed some sort of subliminal messages for me to just hate you in particular.. It's not me thinking for myself at all - oh no. Everyone's opinions must be swayed because of something else.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I think they might be seeing you in a different light from these posts of yours</p></blockquote>I hope they do.<br/>I hope they see me sticking up for a new guy who's posted 21 messages in total, 2 towards Ryori, and neither of them negative or attacking..<br/>If anything, they're complimentary as he's <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">almost</span> flirting with her.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>The postman is a woman so that base is covered.</p></blockquote>I can't BELIEVE [it!] you posteda reply to that.. Well, actually it's more you saying &quot;oh it's a girl, so that's OK.&quot; ... as if &quot;if it were a guy, I'd be concerned&quot;.<br/>So you must be overly scared and jealous when Ryori steps out of the front door by herself incase some guy comes and sweeps her off your feet.<br/>... I do hope you're getting that issue sorted out.",
