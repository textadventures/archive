Much like the spectrum of color that is visible to your eyes, the camera of the observer, it is but a small fraction of the entire spectrum of reality.<br/><br/>Witch Wizwurd's understanding about the subtleties of language is perhaps before its time for the most part.  The world is asleep at the wheel and many of you here are firmly ensconsed in the driver's seat snoring away.  I came here to enlighten a few of you, but the only one who'se attention I have gotten is already there.  Thanks for the props, Witch.  I really appreciate it but I'm IN sane.  This world is outside what is sane.  The inmates pet mice run the asylum.<br/><br/>It is at a critical junction.  All of the options are present and choices need to be made.  Will it be a repeat of what happened the last time or will you actually  move forward this time around?  To which year will it go this time?  It all depends on the conversations that are allowed to continue.  Or cut off.  If it doesen't work you can all try again next timeIt doesn't make any difference to me.",

I thought that the best way to get the point across was to show the admins my post for permission on NEUTRAL GROUND where the same post exists.  Shortly after I made the post, the attacks began.  I tried to make good last night and then I was attacked again.  <br/><br/>I have backed WAY off and have not posted anything which can be construed as offensive lately.  In fact I haven't posted anything at all lately.  You may still be bitter about the rather long analysis that I posted about you a while back.  I don't suppose that I blame you, but I have moved past those days.  Please remember that THAT was only posted due to your abusive behaviour toward my person.  It was an emotional response to your abuse to be frank about it. <br/><br/>As for triple posting, that was unintentional.  I sent the post and nothing happened so I clicked the button again.  The same.  So I clicked it again and then I moved on.  My apologies.  Perhaps a moderator can delete 2 of them.",
