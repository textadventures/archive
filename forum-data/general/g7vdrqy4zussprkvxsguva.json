Which means that the store doesn't get the usual wholesale discount, and the price has to be higher to cover their cut. Also, bookstores usually get books from the publisher on sale-or-return.

But basically, tax bureaucracy has forced me into this dead end where I have to keep writing, I have to do publication myself, I have to treat it as a full time job, and I have to keep every month doing better than the last.
