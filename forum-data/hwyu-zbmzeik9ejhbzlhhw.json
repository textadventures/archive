I tried to publish chapter 1, but it turns out you have to download the game in order to submit it for publication, so I downloaded it as a .zip file and tried to submit it. Then I got an error saying there was no html detected in the file. Can you publish games here from a chromebook? Do I need to convert the game's file type to something else before submitting it? What am I doing wrong?",
