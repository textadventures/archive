I don't see any addons for it for ASL, but if Alex has made one maybe he'll let us know.  It does have addons for other languages, autocomplete, etc.\n\nNotepad++ also supports addons, fold-ups, etc.  I experimented with it some yesterday on creating an addon for ASL.  I couldn't get it to work properly on the foldup, as the way in which it wants you to identify the blocks doesn't exactly fit the way that ASL game blocks are defined.  The biggest advantage is in its being free.  TextPad we have to pay for.\n\nThe ideal editor will also allow the insertion of clips of code, such as complete game blocks, autocomplete, and foldups.\n\nSo, while we're waiting to see what Alex whips up for us, I'll keep looking.\n\nAny other opinions?\n\nAlf",

In just a few hours, I was able to make a quite workable interface for ASL.  The biggest hurdle was code folding.  Since ASL uses the same ending string, &quot;end define&quot;, for each code block, it kept confusing the editor.  Too, things like nested IFs are somewhat problematic.  But now, I have a workable editor - not just for ASL but pretty much any source code/text file.  Not perfect - workable.\n\nMy next goal with it is to have a workable code snippet library.  I don't mind opening another file to copy/paste code snippets from.  It's just easier when the IDE handles it for you.  If UltraEdit handles it well enough, I'll let y'all know.\n\nI like the QDK.  It makes the initial creation of a game easy.  All the basic stuff is ready to go.  However, when it comes time for more in depth stuff, I like to see all the code at once - primarily with nested IFs, and conditionals of more than one level.  That's one area that I hope Alex can expand a bit in future releases of Quest.\n\nSo, I hope my research helps others.\n\nAlf\n\nEdited: Using UltraEdit, I was easily able to add a tag file and a template file.  I added the usual stuff to the tag file (command, define room, etc.).  I added a template for define room, define object.  Everything appears to work as expected.",
