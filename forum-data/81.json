      "EditableText": "I am personally an old school IF lover.  I like the point and click interface of Quest also.  What I'm seeing is that there are many people that are using Quest to create some kind of fast moving RPG (for them it is probably slow still).  In reviews I see there are lots of development ideas, and those are the kinds of reviews I would like.  But, I also think the titles need to split up into genres.  I only say that because I can see some people using this engine to create basic rooms with minimal descriptions, just the objects needed to collect and fight monsters, etc.  I would like to see more descriptions, etc; myself.  Keep in mind there will be some new developments with the Quest engine and don't hold back or discourage people to create these games.  I also recommend that if they are early in devolopment, that the developers name their game appropriately, which may be why the reviews hit them so hard.  Without a version # or \"beta\" or something, you expect more.  \n  Some I see have both elements of RPG and Classic IF and I think will be perfect examples of what the future IF titles should shoot for.   And the inclusion of bonus materials (pics, maps, brochures from places in the game, sound files, etc).",
