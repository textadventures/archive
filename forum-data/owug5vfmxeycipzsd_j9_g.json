I hope there's a way.  \r\n\r\nMy goal is to give in object a 'throw' or verb which will print a list of objects that can get targeted.\r\n\r\nLike:\r\n\r\n>\\>Throw marple\r\n>\r\n>Throw at which target?\r\n>\r\n>1. Cornelius\r\n>2. Laughing Goblin\r\n>3. Window\r\n>\r\n>You throw the marple at Cornelius. The goblin laughs louder.\r\n\r\nI hope it's possible to make it look like this. I thought about using the flag \"throw_target\" and if I throw a object a list of all objects in the room with the \"throw_target\" flag appears. This would become very handy for many future usages in my imagination. Any solutions? \r\n\r\nThx, Curt",
