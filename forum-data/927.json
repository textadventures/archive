When I have the game run the Finish Game command, the screen shows the end game stuff in the lower right hand corner but my loops keep running in the game screen. I have tried everything to end the game. Any help is appreciated.\n\nIn regard to Libraries, is it possible to create a section of a world in the QDK and then save it, procedures and all as a library file? And how would someone go about doing so? I have an area that I want to use in all my adventures that is rather complex and I don't want to have to recode it every time.\n\nLastly, I want to save a players stats (kills, which types of monsters killed, towns visited etc.) into a file and have it available every time he/she enters the world. How would one go about doing that? And is it possible to save stats for a NPC as well?\n\nThanks for your time and help!\n\nMezmriz",
