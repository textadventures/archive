The download version appears to be fine (which is where it was tested) and the same picture is used in another place successfully with the online version.   Is there a known issue with missing resources?   Is there anything I can do to fix it ?   It is only a tiny picture but it is vital to the solution of the puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe game is http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/g2lj8okseeslx8z6cez3aa/lost-cavern (currently \r\n Uncategorised). \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n",
