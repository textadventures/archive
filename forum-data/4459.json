Early on in the game is a bulkhead blocking access to the bridge, and alongside it, an access panel that when used can lock or unlock the bulkhead. \n\nAt the moment I have links off the 'corridor' page to subpages such as 'corridor_exitToBridge' (Go to Bridge) and 'corridor_usePanel' (Use Panel). The first page either moves you through if it is unlocked, or prints 'The bulkhead is sealed' and moves you back to the corridor; while the second changes the relevant variable, prints a quick confirmation message, and moves you back to the corridor.\n\nThis isn't ideal - it makes the game play the description of the corridor again. What I want ideally is an in-place system that, when 'Use Panel' link in the corridor is clicked, updates the variable and prints a message (so runs a script) without leaving the room, and that re-displays the links.\n\nSo the result should be functionally something like this, using '&gt;(command)' to denote choice of hyperlink:\n\n[code:32dkek71]You are in the corridor, standing before the bulkhead&#46; An access panel glows nearby&#46;\n\n(Go down corridor)\n(Go to bridge)\n(Use panel)\n\n&gt;Go to bridge\n\nThe bulkhead is sealed&#46;\n\n(Go down corridor)\n(Go to bridge)\n(Use panel)\n\n&gt;Use panel\n\nThe panel flashes green and the door clicks&#46;\n\n(Go down corridor)\n(Go to bridge)\n(Use panel)\n\n&gt;Go to bridge\n\nWorkstations gleam in front of you, silent and eerie&#46;\n\n(Examine stations)\n(Look out window)\n(Exit to corridor)\n\n&gt;Exit to corridor\n\nYou are in the corridor, standing before the bulkhead&#46; An access panel glows nearby&#46;\n\n(Go down corridor)\n(Go to bridge)\n(Use panel)[/code:32dkek71]\n(Last part included to show that description should be redisplayed upon entering room - so 'first time' scripts are insufficient.)\n\nCan anybody help?",
