Only .aslx files.\r\n\r\nIf you open an existing .aslx file in the editor in Quest 5.8, you need to **be sure the ASL version of your game is changed from 550 to 580 before you play or publish your game**.\r\n\r\nYou can make this happen by:\r\n\r\n1\\.  Making any change at all in the GUI before pressing play (this will trigger an auto-save, which will make the ASL version 580 automatically).\r\n\r\n2\\.  Switch to full code view, and be sure the second line reads ```<asl version=\"580\">```\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is necessary due to changes in hard-coded functions.  \r\n\r\nQuest checks the ASL version while running certain scripts to ensure backwards compatibility.  If a 550 game is loaded, Quest will call ```FinishTurn``` differently than it would with a 580 game.  In 550 games, the hard-coded scripts call ```FinishTurn```.  In 580, the hard-coded scripts **do not** call ```FinishTurn```.  ```FinishTurn``` is called by functions in the Core libraries instead.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean to you?  If you load a 550 .aslx file in the 5.8 editor and press play, Quest is going to call ```FinishTurn``` from the hard-coded scripts.  AND, since you have an .aslx file loaded (which does not include the stuff from the core libraries), Quest will use the stuff in the current Core libraries.  These new scripts will **also** call ```FinishTurn```, hence making your turn scripts go crazy, running twice each turn at best.\r\n\r\nYou would also probably have issues saving a game during play, and I *think* text-to-speech would be problematic.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAgain, you change the game version in the editor once it's opened in 5.8 to quickly fix this, or you can flip to code view and change the ASL version to \"580\" and save from there.\r\n\r\nEither way, it's a 5 second fix, and it only concerns pre 5.8 games when being edited in 5.8.\r\n\r\n---\r\nDid I say all that correctly, Pix?\r\n\r\n</details>",
