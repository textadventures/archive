But that library won't allow you to add another pane once it's started. So you end up having to make the javascript yourself.\r\n\r\nAre you using `JS.sertCustomStatus(\"some text\")` or are you writing your own javascript?\r\nI wrote come code a while back that would allow you to add extra panes; but never finished some of the more advanced features (like allowing the player to drag panes to rearrange and resize them). It's on the forum somewhere, but might be hard to find. Searching the forum might help.\r\n\r\nIf you're just using `JS.setCustomStatus`, then the following line of javascript will give it a header like the other panes:\r\n```\r\n$('#inventoryLabel').clone().attr('id', 'customStatusLabel').removeClass('ui-state-default ui-corner-all').addClass('ui-state-active ui-corner-top').insertBefore($(\"#customStatusPane\").show().attr('style','').removeClass().addClass('ui-accordion-content ui-helper-reset ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom ui-accordion-content-active')).on('click', function () { $('#customStatusPane').animate({height: 'toggle'}, {duration: 200, complete: function() { if($('#customStatusPane:visible').length) {$('#customStatusPane').addClass('ui-accordion-content-active');$('#customStatusLabel').removeClass('ui-state-default ui-corner-all').addClass('ui-state-active ui-corner-top');} else {$('#customStatusPane').removeClass('ui-accordion-content-active');$('#customStatusLabel').addClass('ui-state-default ui-corner-all').removeClass('ui-state-active ui-corner-top');}}});}).children('span.accordion-header-text').text('Status pane');\r\n```\r\n(you can just paste that into a `JS.eval()` statement in your UI initialisation script; or in a javascript file, or similar. I can't believe that took me nearly an hour to type, again)",
