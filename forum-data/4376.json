      "HTML": "here's my example (work still in progress, lol) of what I got done so far for you, of without using multiple verbs (I'll eventually get to giving an example with using multiple verbs, after I get done with this example):<br/><br/>(I've been trying to help you, but this is slow, as I'm not good with coding, and setting up the social questions is complex as it'll depend on your choices... I'm not used to dealing with this level of complexity yet, and not being good at coding makes it, that much harder for me, it'll take me some time to get this stuff done, whereas someone who is good at coding and also who have done this sort of complexity many times already, can get example code out to you much faster and easier than I can.)<br/><br/>(I'm still using the older quest version of &quot;540&quot;, instead of the newest quest version of &quot;550&quot;, so there may be some differences between the two in terms of some of their code lines' syntax~format~structure. You can try to copy and paste my game code into a new game file of yours, changing the ' &lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt; ' to ' &lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt; ', and maybe it'll work, but if not, then you'd need to change some code lines to how they're newly structured~syntaxed~formatted in~for quest version &quot;550&quot;)<br/><br/>(I haven't tested this either, so there's probably errors in my code)<br/><br/>(hopefully, you can get the pattern structure of how to build what you want done, from this example work in progress below)<br/><br/>use the quest wiki, for using these things:<br/><br/>list add<br/>list remove<br/>ListContains<br/>ListCombine or list combine (not sure on it's syntax, lol ~ too lazy to look it up)<br/>ListExclude or list exclude (not sure on it's syntax, lol ~ too lazy to look it up)<br/>Object.Attribute = NewStringList ()<br/>Object.Attribute = NewObjectList ()<br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;d67ec73f-f879-4911-9d88-c02ea527c534&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2014&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>    &lt;author&gt;HegemonKhan&lt;/author&gt;<br/>    &lt;category&gt;Simulation&lt;/category&gt;<br/>    &lt;pov type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;player&lt;/pov&gt;<br/>    &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>      character_creation_function<br/>    &lt;/start&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;verb&gt;<br/>    &lt;property&gt;socialize&lt;/property&gt;<br/>    &lt;pattern&gt;socialize&lt;/pattern&gt;<br/>    &lt;defaultexpression&gt;&quot;You can't socialize with her&#46;&quot;&lt;/defaultexpression&gt;<br/>  &lt;/verb&gt;<br/>  &lt;function name=&quot;character_creation_function&quot;&gt;<br/>    msg (&quot;What is your name?&quot;)<br/>    get input {<br/>      game&#46;pov&#46;alias = result<br/>      sarah&#46;your_name_string = &quot;Hi Sarah, my name is &quot; + game&#46;pov&#46;alias + &quot;&#46;&quot;<br/>      list add (sarah&#46;name_topic_stringlist, sarah&#46;your_name_string)<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/function&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;attr name=&quot;social_score_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>      &lt;attr name=&quot;statusattributes&quot; type=&quot;simplestringdictionary&quot;&gt;social_score_integer = Social Score&#58; !&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;sarah&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;attr name=&quot;name_topic_stringlist&quot; type=&quot;simplestringlist&quot;&gt;I have no name;you blush;you walk away;you stay silent&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>      &lt;attr name=&quot;socialize&quot; type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>        sarah&#46;your_choosen_responses_stringlist = NewStringList ()<br/>        show menu (&quot;Hi, my name is Sarah, what is your name?&quot;, sarah&#46;name_topic_stringlist, false) {<br/>          list add (sarah&#46;your_choosen_responses_stringlist, result)<br/>          if (result = sarah&#46;your_name_string) {<br/>            game&#46;pov&#46;social_score_integer = game&#46;pov&#46;social_score_integer + 2<br/>          } else if (result = &quot;you blush&quot;) {<br/>            game&#46;pov&#46;social_score_integer = game&#46;pov&#46;social_score_integer + 1<br/>          } else if (result = &quot;I have no name&quot; or result = &quot;you stay silent&quot;) {<br/>            game&#46;pov&#46;social_score_integer = game&#46;pov&#46;social_score_integer - 1<br/>          } else if (result = &quot;you walk away&quot;) {<br/>            game&#46;pov&#46;social_score_integer = game&#46;pov&#46;social_score_integer - 2<br/>          }<br/>          on ready {<br/>            if (ListContains (sarah&#46;your_choosen_responses_stringlist, sarah&#46;your_name_string) = true) {<br/>              // show menu (&quot;Nice to meet you, <br/>            }<br/>          }<br/>      &lt;/attr&gt;<br/>      &lt;attr name=&quot;displayverbs&quot; type=&quot;listextend&quot;&gt;Socialize&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre>",
