A lot of the things that I want to put in the game I have no idea how to code, even basic things like skill checks and random monster encounters.  I expect this to be a pretty involving coding process as the game I have in mind is rather extensive in scope. Basically I'm looking to set up a working partnership and also to learn a little bit about coding in the process. \n\nAny interested parties can reply here or can shoot me an email at <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:damienlavizzo@yahoo.com\">damienlavizzo@yahoo.com</a><!-- e -->.
