Alex, and the other guys here on this forum have been very helpful and don't seem to mind questions from people who are trying.  Of course, those who ask questions but don't put any effort into learning are a little tiresome.  I'm still a beginner with Quest myself (see my earlier posts), but have gotten a lot of great help from members of this forum.\n\nAnyway, that's just my opinion.",
