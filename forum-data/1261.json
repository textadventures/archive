Am I going to regret asking you this...?\n_________________\nYou are but a stupid name in a stupid game.[/quote:1n03gx4l]\n\nLeviathan,\nYou are about to enter into the alphanumerical web of reality.  As your signature aptly states: &quot;You are a... name in a... game.&quot;  Consider the notion that you &quot;spell&quot; with letters and that magic is cast with &quot;spells.&quot;  Next, if you anagrammatize the word spell, the only solution is &quot;pells&quot; from &quot;pell-mell,&quot; which is &quot;a confused or jumbled mess.&quot;  Using this knowledge, instead of viewing it as meaningless junk, entertain the notion that it is an alphabetical code, meant to be found and used.  I did, and followed the trail further.  In my hunt, I stumbled upon the word &quot;pi,&quot; which, also, means &quot;any confused mixture; jumble.&quot;  I then connected &quot;pi&quot; to the acronym &quot;PI&quot; or &quot;Principal Investigator,&quot; and assumed that role.\n\nspell/spell\npell-mell\npi PI (or pi's Principal Investigator)\n\nThen I became interested in the &quot;spell/spell&quot; connection.  What if words denoting syntax anagrammatically resolved into terms concerning magic? I asked myself.  So I put the pen to the paper.  I found anagrams and added them to their source and found that short descriptions were created, such as: PHRASE SHAPER, SERVE VERSE, SENTENCE NET SCENE. I also found that WORD transformed into DROW and ROW'D.  I read WORD DROW ROW'D as an instruction, so I &quot;drew&quot; a &quot;row&quot; and placed words into it, like as follows:\n\nPHRASE SENTENCE   VERSE      - (syntactical descriptions)\n-----------------------------------\nSHAPER NET SCENE; SERVE.    - (anecdote)\n\nAfter much research, I unveiled many types of formats that hold specific types of information, such as: Morals; past, present, and future events; personal anecdotes; how reality was created; and more.  So as a service to Axe Forum members, especially those in the U.K., I created a thread entitled &quot;Q-Bert Style&quot; and went live with a prediction.  It met with much opposition, considering readers weren't able to understand how disassembling and reassembling [i:1n03gx4l]their words[/i:1n03gx4l] could be used to prophesy, which I've never explained as of yet.  If you read the thread, study the posts concerning code by others and me; this will require you to ignore flame-wars by others, which is probably 2/3rds of the thread (as usual).  You'll notice that I'm pulling data from other posters and combining it into a general storyline about terrorism (some data spoken of might be in other threads, so you might have to look around).  The events the decryptions refer to do occur and how the decryptions connect to the events are described in the thread.  You have to imagine the decryptions as &quot;becoming clearer&quot; in meaning as the situation they speak of nears.\n\nKeep in mind, it's a [i:1n03gx4l]code[/i:1n03gx4l].  It's not a word-for-word account of what was going to happen/did happen.  \n\nKeep in mind, the ingenuity involved in linearly decoding something like tr0n's signature, without reordering the sequence of its letters at first, anagrammatizing it, then building words and abbreviations from it that are real and can be referenced.  You must consider that this decryption, using my process, is the only sensible result possible, which must mean [i:1n03gx4l]something[/i:1n03gx4l].\n\nUsually when I employ my process there are people who develop a strong resistance to it, even get angry or absurd.  I believe those people see it works, but they realize that it can spoil the element of surprise (what the future holds) or that it hints toward a preplanned destiny, and this upsets them.\n\nMy heart went out to those in he U.K. when I dumped my decryptions upon them, and I only meant it as protection and a way for them to prepare.  You'll notice no one responded to my latest post in the &quot;Q-Bert&quot; thread concerning the date that the Israel-Lebanon Cease-Fire Agreement was signed, but then again you won't see any replies in my &quot;Utopia&quot; thread either.

      "HTML": "Leviathan asks and says:<br/><blockquote><p>WW, I've seen you post stuff like this before...what is it? Some form of numerology, except with words? Am I going to regret asking you this...?<br/>_________________<br/>You are but a stupid name in a stupid game.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Leviathan,<br/>You are about to enter into the alphanumerical web of reality.  As your signature aptly states: &quot;You are a... name in a... game.&quot;  Consider the notion that you &quot;spell&quot; with letters and that magic is cast with &quot;spells.&quot;  Next, if you anagrammatize the word spell, the only solution is &quot;pells&quot; from &quot;pell-mell,&quot; which is &quot;a confused or jumbled mess.&quot;  Using this knowledge, instead of viewing it as meaningless junk, entertain the notion that it is an alphabetical code, meant to be found and used.  I did, and followed the trail further.  In my hunt, I stumbled upon the word &quot;pi,&quot; which, also, means &quot;any confused mixture; jumble.&quot;  I then connected &quot;pi&quot; to the acronym &quot;PI&quot; or &quot;Principal Investigator,&quot; and assumed that role.<br/><br/>spell/spell<br/>pell-mell<br/>pi PI (or pi's Principal Investigator)<br/><br/>Then I became interested in the &quot;spell/spell&quot; connection.  What if words denoting syntax anagrammatically resolved into terms concerning magic? I asked myself.  So I put the pen to the paper.  I found anagrams and added them to their source and found that short descriptions were created, such as: PHRASE SHAPER, SERVE VERSE, SENTENCE NET SCENE. I also found that WORD transformed into DROW and ROW'D.  I read WORD DROW ROW'D as an instruction, so I &quot;drew&quot; a &quot;row&quot; and placed words into it, like as follows:<br/><br/>PHRASE SENTENCE   VERSE      - (syntactical descriptions)<br/>-----------------------------------<br/>SHAPER NET SCENE; SERVE.    - (anecdote)<br/><br/>After much research, I unveiled many types of formats that hold specific types of information, such as: Morals; past, present, and future events; personal anecdotes; how reality was created; and more.  So as a service to Axe Forum members, especially those in the U.K., I created a thread entitled &quot;Q-Bert Style&quot; and went live with a prediction.  It met with much opposition, considering readers weren't able to understand how disassembling and reassembling <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">their words</span> could be used to prophesy, which I've never explained as of yet.  If you read the thread, study the posts concerning code by others and me; this will require you to ignore flame-wars by others, which is probably 2/3rds of the thread (as usual).  You'll notice that I'm pulling data from other posters and combining it into a general storyline about terrorism (some data spoken of might be in other threads, so you might have to look around).  The events the decryptions refer to do occur and how the decryptions connect to the events are described in the thread.  You have to imagine the decryptions as &quot;becoming clearer&quot; in meaning as the situation they speak of nears.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, it's a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">code</span>.  It's not a word-for-word account of what was going to happen/did happen.  <br/><br/>Keep in mind, the ingenuity involved in linearly decoding something like tr0n's signature, without reordering the sequence of its letters at first, anagrammatizing it, then building words and abbreviations from it that are real and can be referenced.  You must consider that this decryption, using my process, is the only sensible result possible, which must mean <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">something</span>.<br/><br/>Usually when I employ my process there are people who develop a strong resistance to it, even get angry or absurd.  I believe those people see it works, but they realize that it can spoil the element of surprise (what the future holds) or that it hints toward a preplanned destiny, and this upsets them.<br/><br/>My heart went out to those in he U.K. when I dumped my decryptions upon them, and I only meant it as protection and a way for them to prepare.  You'll notice no one responded to my latest post in the &quot;Q-Bert&quot; thread concerning the date that the Israel-Lebanon Cease-Fire Agreement was signed, but then again you won't see any replies in my &quot;Utopia&quot; thread either.  If you can determine why that is, then you'll understand.<br/><br/>Make sure you read the dates of my posts, so it's obvious that any future-telling is done before the event or any public knowledge of that the event occurred.<br/><br/>-W.",
