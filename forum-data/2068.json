I think this is the key to 'ask/talk' working effectively. The responses need to guide the conversation into the areas they are designed to have useful responses to.  The trick is to do this in a reasonably subtle way so that it feels like a natural conversational flow.  Also you need to have appropriate opening points to the conversation so that we don't get;\n\n[quote:3fec2nab]I've played, or rather tried to play, a few games where I had no idea what to say.[/quote:3fec2nab]\n\nThat (to me) means there's something adrift with the way the NPC has been introduced / developed. To use my Librarian with the sportscar fetish example, because she is standing behind the counter in the library and wearing a 'head librarian' badge when she is first introduced to the player, it isn't a great leap of logic to realise she might well know something (if asked) about the library, its stock or regular customers.  It wouldn't be at all obvious that she was a petrolhead who could usefully be asked about sports cars and in particular the Porsche in the car park that you passed on your way into the library.\n\nNow there are lots of ways to 'lead' the player (in conversation) to discover the Librarian's unusual interest.

I think this is the key to 'ask/talk' working effectively. The responses need to guide the conversation into the areas they are designed to have useful responses to.  The trick is to do this in a reasonably subtle way so that it feels like a natural conversational flow.  Also you need to have appropriate opening points to the conversation so that we don't get;<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I've played, or rather tried to play, a few games where I had no idea what to say.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>That (to me) means there's something adrift with the way the NPC has been introduced / developed.
