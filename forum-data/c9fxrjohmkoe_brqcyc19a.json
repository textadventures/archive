How do I do that? I've cobbled together something with scripts, but it's a bit unwieldy. After searching the forum, I added this library:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Library:-Independent-NPCs\r\n\r\nwhich sounded like it would be the answer to my prayers, but I still can't figure out how I get the NPC to wear clothing. The actions that need to happen in the game are:\r\n\r\n1. NCP starts out wearing bathrobe.\r\n2. NCP removes bathrobe at certain point in game.\r\n3. Player gives NPC a towel and he wears that.\r\n\r\nHow do I achieve those things?",
