Very possible I'll find that it was the same issue on ActiveLit.  If so, what it implies is that when you click the publish button (on textadventures or activelit), an error in the story code throws a crash-worthy error on the backend, but the frontend doesn't know how to handle or announce it.\r\n\r\nThat's my current working theory.
