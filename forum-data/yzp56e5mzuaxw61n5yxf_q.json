I wrote my first interactive text adventure in 1985 on an Apple //c using ProDOS and Pascal. \r\nIt had four rooms, the disk had to access the disk every time you moved to a room to get the room's information because there wasn't enough memory (128K total) to store the information in a record array in memory, but it was fun. It was sort of Zork-ish.\r\n\r\nThen a few years ago I showcased to Alex Warren a text adventure maker whose foundation was a Microsoft Access Database. He asked me why go that route and I said because I didn't want any meaningful limitations to the size of a given text adventure world, and with 2+ billion entries available in the entity table, I knew it would be wide open and people could make as huge and as detailed of a world as they wanted without any significant performance slowdowns or issues, but it never saw the light of day because it had no player, required a downloadable runtime executable of MS Access, and its underpinnings weren't anywhere near as versatile as Quest.  I killed it.\r\n\r\nAs much as I would like to help, I lack the technical expertise to help building out Quest, and with this old brain turning to sand, you wouldn't want me anywhere near the code, anyway. \r\n\r\nI do wish for there to be future versions of Quest as well as continued online activity surrounding it. I'm on a fixed income; I can't afford to throw money at the project.\r\n\r\nI therefore ask, if there's anyone out there lurking in the Quest forums with the technical expertise that the current custodians of Quest need, then please, please, please consider stepping forward to offer your support in a profound, sustained, long-term way.  You won't get rich. You won't get famous. But you'd definitely have the gratitude of the entire Quest community and the satisfaction of knowing you contributed to the longevity of a worthwhile project.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
