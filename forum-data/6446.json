The you will find the stats attributes. Create the one you want and then type what will be displayed to the player. Down at attributes, you insert it again, but this time you will set the type of attribute it is. When you think of numbers, it is an Int.  If you think of a word of phrase, it is string type.\n\nThe upper part will tell Quest what to display. The lower part tells it what to store ad consult. \n\nIn general terms, if you create an attribute named &quot;strength &quot; for the rest of the game Quest will see it as player.strength and if you create this attribute to an npc named Jacob, it will become Jacob . strength",
