It is the only way to make text adventures live again, I think. I tried Bump and it is nice to play it on iPhone. \n\nIn a previous answer, you said: &quot;If you want to turn your game into an app, you'll need to contact me, and I'll work with you to create the app version&quot;.\n\nSo, you'll do it everytime? Do you have time to do it? \n\nIt would be difficult to do it on my own? (I've programming experience only with Inform... nothing else at all!).\ncheers,\nfc",
