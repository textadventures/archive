I have made what I am trying to do here work many years ago, but I lost the file with that code so hear I am again asking.\r\nI have this game where you go into a dark room. I have several different verbs you choose from. Each has a list of responces that the game \"Randomly chooses from, and when a rsponce is chosen its removed from the list to prevent repeats. SO what I want to do is create a variable to count each turn verb is selected and when it reaches a vcertain number the game moves on. So let's say ten counts and the game automatically progress. That way you can't go through an an entire list or combination of either verb. I have tried to do this by declaring an anttribute in the rooms code to count turns.\r\nNext\r\nI use this code in each verb\r\n    if (ListCount(this.dr_verb_message_list) > 0) {\r\n  picked = PickOneString (thisdr_message_list)\r\n  list remove (thisdr_message_list, picked)\r\n  msg (picked)\r\n dark_room_object.action_turns + 1\r\n  if (dark_room_object.action_turns <= 5) {\r\n    msg (\"'Will you keep it down!'
