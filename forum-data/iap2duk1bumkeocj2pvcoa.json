It tells the load/save engine to ignore anything inside the function, and pass it to the script engine as one piece.\r\n\r\nThis is only necessary if the script contains something that looks like it might be XML or HTML. I believe Quest  adds them automatically to any function that contains `<` or `>` characters. They're basically just to make life easier for the bit of code that is responsible for loading files.",
