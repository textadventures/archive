Player sees another item he/she can take but a message will say that he/she can no longer pick up an item unless he/she drops or uses the current ones he/she has. How will I do that?\r\n\r\n2. How do I upgrade their items? \r\nEx. Player has a maximum of 2 items in his/her pockets. Then he/she decided to upgrade and so the maximum of items expands. Is that possible? If so, can anyone help me?\r\n\r\n3. How do I make it possible for players to change clothing, weapon, etc.?\r\nEx. If player is wearing a current beltpouch that can contain 2 items and he/she sees a bigger beltpouch that can keep 3 items. So now player wants to take it and drop the current one he/she has. Is it possible to make that happen? Same thing for weapon. If player has a handgun with 12 ammo and player sees a handgun with 24 ammo, player would prefer that one. How do I do that?\r\n\r\nPlease help me. Thank you.",
