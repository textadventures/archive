The person who looks at your source code might not even be in the same country as you so issuing legal proceedings would be difficult to say the least. Even if they are in the same country, legal proceedings aren't cheap. You could sue them for looking at your code, but odds on it'd cost you a lot more in legal fees than you'd get off them in any settlement (assuming you even won your case, which is pretty doubtful). Then there's the fallout from it. Taking legal action against someone just for looking at your code, which is freely available, isn't going to reflect well on you. \n\nIn other words: way more trouble than it's worth.",
