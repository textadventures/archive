      "EditableText": "I am not sure if the original question was a matter or formatting or coding. But if you are concerned about formating, it is a tricky thing. Interactive Fiction became famous by its vagueness and short descriptions. Part of this comes from the problem that when you are trying to pretend the player is the character, the less you say, the less conflict you get, as you reduce the chance of conveying any trait or information tha conflicts with the player him/her/it-self.  I, personally, find it somewhat limiting, because the less information the player gets, there is a problem about creating blind choices. At other hand, there is the Wall of Text. Every time a player faces too much text poping up at a page, the reading interest gets stressed. If the players is already very invested, there are high chances of he/she/it wanting getting through a whole full page.  But, if you try doing this at the very beggining of a story, there is almost no investment from the player yet, so it is quit probable quitting the game at all.",
