      "EditableText": "Im trying to make a realistic rpg with many options that could be done in real life eg. buying something/selling something. I am using the score system as money, so i dont clutter inventories with coins, and that works fine. My only problem is making shops. I would like some way of making a container in which an item inside requires that it has a special verb used on it first (check) so to buy a sword the player would have to use check sword which would display price and uses of item which is easy enough and then could use either buy sword (which would only work if the sword was in it's original container) and then the score would be deducted by say 50 and the sword would be added to inventory, and then a similar function with sell, in which the player has to check first, then sell. the buy and sell would not be able to be used with the &quot;all&quot; thing, like can be done by take all for example. However, I also want it so that the object cannot be taken from the original container, but can be dropped and taken after that. Also is there a way to put an item inside a container?",
