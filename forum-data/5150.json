It's found in Mr Zix's house. Mr Zix needs to be removed from his house. Speak to Ramone the cat burglar which involves fake art (persistence with him is a must), a poster about the ‘Minor Loser’, Laslo the Artist’s artistry skills (at a price involving “water”), avoiding a City Guard and the grille under the table in the Dancing Octopus tavern that goes to the sewers. With the Brass key, get into Zix’s house and find a secret door. The spell book will help you out with the Firebird.\n\n2) [b:2x7zh3p8]The Bone from a Fish.[/b:2x7zh3p8] Find the iron key to unlock Lord COD's crypt. To solve the puzzle at the crossroads involves the cat at Shadow Alley (and the same action again inside the crypt.) Don’t just STAND around you need to cut that overgrown grass!\n\n3) [b:2x7zh3p8]The Blue Pearl.[/b:2x7zh3p8] One-Eyed John has hidden it in a box in the sewers.  Jorak the Musician likes anything musical (give him something to satisfy this interest) and One-eyed John was seen by Jorak going somewhere. DIG around somewhere in that place. (DO NOT give the silver key back to One-Eyed John as you'll never get it back and have to start from the beginning.) Find the pearl in the sewers but only if you speak to Jorak when he has moved.\n\nGive all ingredients to Altrobus and drink the potion before you descend into the watery depths. Make sure you have the amulet worn to speak to any underwater residents (with intelligence to talk back.)\n\n[b:2x7zh3p8][u:2x7zh3p8]Part 2: Under the Sea[/u:2x7zh3p8][/b:2x7zh3p8]\n\nKing Neptunus’ daughter, Princess Flounder, has been kidnapped and it’s your job to save her! Yeah, right!\n\nThe Water Elemental has the Princess. The map will help you with the riddle for the altar and how to defeat the Elemental and rescue the damp royal.\n\nThe Sea Hag controls the Octopus. The Trident is useful for dislodgments. The Medusa Crystal turns watery crones into stone.  Everything else is decoration?!\n\nThat Orb of Dragons is tricky to grab! Maybe someone else can help? A conch shell shaped like a horn could attract some wildlife! Ride ‘em, cowboy or not! At the plinth again? Where’s my ride that panics too much?\n\n[b:2x7zh3p8][u:2x7zh3p8]Part 3: Rescuing is a running theme![/u:2x7zh3p8][/b:2x7zh3p8]\n\nA ransom note! Altrobus has been kidnapped by Captain Bloodbeard. If only you had something that could help you? It’s a nice view on top of the tower. Even better with that telescope. Yikes! What would happened if I give that beastie a CALL? Ride ‘em, cowboy and you stay on! Take that Captain Bloodbeard!\n\nThe End.",
