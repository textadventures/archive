      "EditableText": "Hi, I just started using the gamebook for a game that I was making (duh) and I was messing around with it until I was trying to set up input for first and last names. Of course, I will be trying to be as <s>lazy</s> efficient as I can try to use the copy feature. I copy the page of the first name page and altered the script set variable to player.alias to player.alias1. However, when I went back and did the name input for both first name and last name ({player.alias} {player.alias1}) only the last name would show up. I then went back to check my script for the first name and realized that it was changed to player.alias1. I tested this again by making a new character name input page and copying it and it was mirrored. If I change the script of the original or the copy, the others will follow suit. The description does not mirror though. If I add a new script into the page, the others will also have that new script as well.\r\n\r\nThe only known fix I have to this atm is to copy the page I want, save and restart and the issue will be no more. I am not sure if this is a known bug or if it is just my client, but if there is another method of copying so I do not need to close my client every time, that would be great.",
