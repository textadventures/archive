I was mainly wondering about how to make the command line box appear inside a specific room during the game. I'm experimenting with making a hybrid between a gamebook and a text adventure; I set up the game to not display the command input line at the beginning by unticking the box--would like to see how to make it appear again (and disappear) as needed. I'd like to implement certain rooms inside the game which allow a greater degree of interactivity than what is possible using a choice-based menu; then have the game revert back to gamebook mode when they exit that room. Thanks for any ideas or help with this!",
