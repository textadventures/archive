      "EditableText": "Hi there,\r\nfirst of all, sorry for the bad thread title. I didn't know how to put it differently.\r\nSecond, sorry if the question was already asked.\r\n\r\nHow do I let verbs and commands \"progress\".\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nMy character is able to shoot a guard, when he has his guard (hehe) down. So, the guard confronts my character and my character shoots the guard. The message says something like \"You pull your gun blazingly fast and shoot the guard.\" Great!\r\nNow the scene can play out very differently though.\r\nThe guard and my character are fighting and if the player chooses wrong, a party member is shot. Now, I wanted it so that whatever the player chooses, he will be shot dead, too, because he is down on the ground. \r\nIf I write \"punch\" or \"kick\" or whatever else, the same message as above plays. So that it seems that my character got the upper hand and killed the guard.\r\n\r\nI am really, really new to all this. \r\nI mainly use object flags. Is there a better way? (Of course, I guess). And those seem to be the problem.\r\nEven though I unset flags, it is still showing the wrong message.\r\n\r\nI also tried to use an object counter for another approach. The guard can be choked when he is on the ground and there are different stages. (choking, more choking, choking till the guard passes out, choke till the guard is dead).\r\n\r\nIf I type in \"choke guard\" the game displays all messages, like this.\r\n1. You choke the guard.\r\nThe guard tries to fight back. \r\n2. You choke him more. The guard fights harder.\r\n3. You choke him harder. The guard faints.\r\n4. You chocke even harder. The guard dies.\r\n\r\nThe numbers are just for you to see that those are four different messages I want to print, but all are displays at the same time.\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me and know what I mean.\r\nI checked the forums and the tutorials but couldn't find anything. Sorry, if I missed a thread or two.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nWesk",
