Neither is good or bad within itself.<br/><br/>There are undoubtedly IF games where, if you knew the solutions to the puzzles, they'd be over fairly quickly. But the working out of the puzzles can take days, and that can be an enjoyable part of it. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>I completely agree. And sometimes you want to relax and let your mind wander, and sometimes you want to be engaged and interactive. Speaking of which, is anyone working on a 'choose-your-own-ending' game right now?",

I would also like to make it more of a virtual reality thing, but that is still too new for me to do it any justice. If anyone is adept at VR and wants to collaborate, I'm all for that.",
