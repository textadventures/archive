I'm already leaning toward 'Sandpit' when I sample a game especially if it is CYOA. Also, the majority of TA's, too, lack depth and proper design. I realize there isn't much I can do about this. I'm just venting. There are now 80-ish games remaining yet to be catergorized and I'm willing to bet that 70-ish are destined to the sandpit. Why would people create games that are that poor? Is the Smobie (smart phone zombie) generation so far removed from proper grammar and creativity that text lingo, 80-word run-on sentences, and lack of capitalization are the norm?",
