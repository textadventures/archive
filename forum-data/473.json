What about the old fashion adventure points for solving a puzzle?  Like King's Quest...\nI know it's a simple command to enter but since I am strictly QDK right now, I have to learn how to do certain coding to add what I want.  Is it a variable thing that I need to do?  Further, is it something that I need to put in the game properties or in the individual objects that are used to solve the puzzles?\nHere comes that \"hamster\" example again:\n\nLet's say I want the player to get 1 point for putting a hamster in the microwave and then another point for turning it on, how would I get this to work?  Finally, how do I make and where are the 'points accumulated/total points available' displayed during gameplay?\n\nthanks a lot,\nsteve the 'whole lotta questions' guy",
