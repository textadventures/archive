      "EditableText": "I decided to do the tutorial again to refresh my memory and I discovered what I think is a bug.  I hit the part where I added the verb “watch” to the TV object, and I have it set to print text that says, “You watch TV.”.  When I run the game and enter the command, “watch TV”, it says, “I don’t understand your command.”.    This works fine on the PC version.  But the online version doesn’t seem to accept new verbs.  I even tried to set the verb “watch” to run a script, and selected “print a message”, and it gave the same result.  This problem doesn’t exist in the PC version.   *Edit*  I just did some testing.  When I run the browser version on my PC, it works fine.  BUT, when I run the browser version on ANY browser in my iPhone, the problem occurs.  Any verb I add doesn't work.",
