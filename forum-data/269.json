      "EditableText": "Hi\n\n[ Updated QuestNet Server test release - new URL in my post below ]\n\nThis implements the much-requested \"save game\" feature. It saves everything the usual single-player Quest QSG format saves, but it doesn't save the current rooms of any of the players. Why? Because players are referenced by their user ID, but when players come to reconnect, they will be allocated a different ID.\n\nThis may or may not be important - if the game is a free-for-all then players can re-join back at the normal start point, but any changes to the world before the game was saved will still be present.\n\nIf you're using logins, you may or may not want players to go back to where they were when the game was saved. This should be easy enough to do with some ASL. Is there anything I can do to make this easier? For example I can see that having some code block which can run just before the game is saved would be useful?\n\nMy problem at the moment is there are so many ways games could be made for QuestNet Server, and I don't want to make any particular type too difficult for game authors to implement. But because there aren't any games available yet, I have no idea either of what particular types of games will be most popular.\n\nSo, please download this update and have a play with it. Let me know if you encounter any problems, and also let me know if there are any features I can add to make the save game feature more useful.\n\nAs always, people who give me helpful feedback and bug reports will receive a discounted or free copy of one of the QuestNet Server editions when it is finally released (only been three and half years in the making so far.... <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> )",
