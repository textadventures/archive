I'd like to ask you another question  <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif\" alt=\":mrgreen:\" title=\"Mr. Green\" /><!-- s:mrgreen: -->  I've built a room with one object in it, and I want it to have only the &quot;use&quot; function (no &quot;look&quot;, &quot;take&quot;, etc.). I deleted the other verbs in the &quot;object&quot; menu and of course, it works well : when I click on it, only the verb &quot;use&quot; is displayed next to the hyperlink of my object.<br/>But is there any way to get the &quot;use&quot; function works directly by clicking on the hyperlink of the object ? The sub-menu is quite useless here as my object can just be used, and I think it would be more user-friendly for the player.<br/><br/>Thank you  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->",

But unfortunately, it seems impossible to link the displayed verbs to any scripts or actions : it displays an error message. I even tried to copy/paste some code from an object to an exit in my game file, but it still doesn't work. Maybe exits are not designed to support verbs interactions ?<br/>Anyway, it makes me re-think about my interface, and I decided to simplify it, so that I don't need this sub-menu anymore. It is much simpler now, and I think that's a good thing.<br/><br/>But again, thank you very much Pertex for your precious advices  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->",
