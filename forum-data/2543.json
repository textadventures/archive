I also notice that you have a placeholder for a JavaScript topic in the new tutorial, I would be happy to help with this item if you could give me some guidelines on what you had in mind (I am currently delivering a JS course for a client, based on Rhino). \n\nThanks\nStephen",

I'm happy for people to update the wiki - I keep an eye on all changes so you'll soon find out whether I approve or not!\n\nRegarding the Javascript item, that's a placeholder for me to document the &lt;javascript&gt; tag which lets you specify which .js files to embed. I don't think we should be documenting Javascript itself on the wiki though as there's the rest of the internet for that - the wiki entry should just be about how it relates specifically to Quest, and I'm probably the best person to document that right now (although you're welcome to poke around the source code to figure things out if you like!)",
