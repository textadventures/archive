When the player enters that room, I'd like to have the radio periodically emit some background chatter, pulling randomly from a list of pre-written phrases every five seconds or so. \r\n\r\nI tried something like this with the \"play a message 5 seconds after entering the room\" command, but (1) the game will continue running down the list of responses even after the player has left the room and I want the responses ONLY to happen while the player is in the room with the radio object and (2) I can't really get it to be random.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'm explaining that very well, but any help would be most appreciated. Thanks muchly!",
