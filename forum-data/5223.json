The main issue I'm having is getting rid of the old ones.  I basically can get it to add a new random item every x seconds but don't know how to make it so it has no more then, let's say 5 items at 1 time.  Any suggestions?\nIs there a way to clear all items from a room?\nIf I can't override the objects in a room, I'd like to at least be able to add a max count where the shop quits refilling once it reaches a certain amount of items.",

Each chest would have a different combination of items in them.  Once an object has been added to the players inventory, I'd move all identical items to a dead room.  It's a dumb solution, but the only one I'd be capable of pulling off... lol\n\nGood luck!",
