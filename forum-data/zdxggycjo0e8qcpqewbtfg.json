      "EditableText": "There's a few ways to do this.\r\n\r\nOne is to make a String List and fill the options in, and then have the Show Menu call from that. Useful if you want a flexible menu that might change:\r\n```\r\nExampleList=NewStringList()\r\nlist add (ExampleList, \"Check\")\r\nlist add (ExampleList, \"Learn\")\r\nlist add (ExampleList, \"Later\")\r\nShowMenu (\"<br/>Would you like to learn a new skill from Dalia?\", ExampleList, false) {\r\n  switch (result) {\r\n    case (\"Check\") {\r\n    //Check stuff\r\n    }\r\ncase (\"Learn\") {\r\n    //Learn stuff\r\n    }\r\ncase (\"Later\") {\r\n    //Later stuff\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other way is to use Split. Split takes a string, and 'splits' it into a String List at a certain cue.\r\n\r\nIf you have, say, \"WhataDamnWorld\" as a string, and you split with cue \"a\", then you get a string list:\r\n```\r\nWhat\r\nD\r\nmnWorld\r\n``\r\nSo what you can do is have the ShowMenu take the menu:\r\n```\r\nSplit(\"Check-Learn-Later\", \"-\")\r\n```\r\nThis is more useful for static menus where you don't expect them to change.",
