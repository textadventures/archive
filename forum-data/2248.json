That and I never did get around to bugfixxing that massive 2500kb file that was &quot;Gathered in Darkness.&quot;  I have been thinking of porting it to another format but I thought I should at least finish what I've started.  Been away from it long enough that I'm actually excited about putting it back together.\n\nAnyway,  hope you guys are great and maybe I can get this knocked out pretty quick.\n\nDr. Froth",
