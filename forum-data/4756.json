      "EditableText": "Yes.\n\nYou can set the page type using the &quot;Page type&quot; dropdown when you click on a page. It defaults to &quot;Text&quot;.\n\nOnce you have the page set to either &quot;Script&quot; or &quot;Script + Text&quot;, then you will have a Script section where you can add script commands. You will find the  commands to set flags on and off under the Variables section. You'll find the &quot;if&quot; script statement under the Scripts section. \n\nIf you can describe what you want the behavior to be when they do and don't have the key, I might be able to help with that. I don't know a way to prevent someone from clicking on a link. So you might have to dynamically add and remove the link through the locked door depending on the key - or have the page the door link goes to check if they have the key and then send them back if not. (That might be cleaner for the user. That way they still have the link to click on, but it won't let them move on.) You could do that with a routing script-only page that either sends the player on if they have the key or back if not.",
