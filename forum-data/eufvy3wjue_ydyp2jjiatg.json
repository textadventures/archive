The resulting file ends up being about 1.5 times larger in filesize than the original ```.ttf```, but it appears to do the trick.\r\n\r\nNow, when I put the following in my initialization script:\r\n```\r\n// Add custom font to CSS\r\nfonturl = GetFileData(\"CinderelaURIString.txt\")\r\nJS.eval (\"$('<style>').appendTo('head').text('@font-face {font-family: FLF;src: url(\\\"\"+fonturl+\"\\\");}')\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe font properly loads.
