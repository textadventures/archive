      "EditableText": "First of all, I dunno, lol, but I always like to try to help since I do learn something in the process as well.\r\n\r\nYour question is hard to search on forum or quest documentation so I used Ip Man's Microsoft copilot instead, copilot can be a hit or miss as it is done by an automated bot, not a human, so take the answer with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nThe error message you encountered is related to attribute arguments in your code. Let‚Äôs break it down:\r\n\r\n1. Error Message:\r\nError running script: Error evaluating expression 'TypeOf(value) = \"int\" and attr = \"money\" and HasString(game, \"moneyformat\")': Specified argument was out of the range of valid values. Parameter name: Unrecognised type 'System.Decimal'\r\n\r\n2. Explanation:\r\nThe error occurs when you‚Äôre using an attribute with an argument that doesn‚Äôt meet the expected criteria.\r\nSpecifically, it‚Äôs complaining about the type of the argument you‚Äôre passing.\r\n\r\n3. Attribute Arguments:\r\nIn your code, you have an attribute with the following expression:\r\nTypeOf(value) = \"int\" and attr = \"money\" and HasString(game, \"moneyformat\")\r\nThis expression is used as an argument for an attribute (probably something like [SomeAttribute(...)]).\r\n\r\n4. Issues in the Expression:\r\nThe error message points out that the type ‚ÄòSystem.Decimal‚Äô is unrecognized. This means that the expression you‚Äôre using doesn‚Äôt match the expected types for attribute arguments.\r\nThe expression seems to be checking whether value is of type ‚Äúint,‚Äù whether attr is equal to ‚Äúmoney,‚Äù and whether the game has a string called ‚Äúmoneyformat.‚Äù\r\n5. Potential Causes:\r\nThe issue might be related to the way you‚Äôre using TypeOf(value) = \"int\". Attribute arguments typically expect constant expressions, and this dynamic check might not be allowed.\r\nThe ‚Äúunrecognized type‚Äù error could be due to the combination of conditions or the specific types involved.\r\n6. Solution:\r\nTo fix this, consider using constant values for attribute arguments.\r\nIf you need dynamic behavior, you might need to rethink your approach or find an alternative way to achieve the desired functionality.\r\n7. Rounding Issue:\r\nYou mentioned that rounding an integer number using Round(Int) also caused a similar error.\r\nConverting the number to a double (by multiplying with 1.0) resolved the issue. This suggests that the attribute argument expects a specific type (like a double) rather than an integer.\r\n\r\nIn summary, review the attribute usage in your code, ensure that the arguments are constant expressions, and verify the expected types. If you encounter similar issues, consider alternative approaches or consult the documentation for the specific attribute you‚Äôre using. ü§ñüëç",
