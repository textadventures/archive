In QDK set up a conditional script command for the look script.\n\n2. change the object's \"look\" property or action. e.g. \"property look &lt;vase; The vase is in tiny pieces all over the floor&gt;\" will change the description of the vase, for example after the player has dropped it. In QDK use the script command to change an object's property and enter the required info.\n\nMore details at <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.axeuk.com/quest/developer/asl/script-changeproperties.htm\">http://www.axeuk.com/quest/developer/as ... erties.htm</a><!-- m -->",
