Always.  One of the hardest things to imagine (at least for my students) is the absence of things.  Space is essentially nothing.  Think of all the things that go along with that namely heat transfer.  How does heat transfer?  It must have something to transfer INTO.  Without that something, you will not get efficient heat transfer.  That's why cold water is SO good at dropping your body temperature.  Space is MUCH colder than a nearly frozen pond, for example, but the pond transfers your heat from your body much quicker than the void of space.  I read somewhere that your body will lose about as much heat as a 100-w light bulb per minute (?).  This would eventually kill you, but you'll die much faster due to asphyxia (lack of O2) and ebullism (swelling from escaping gas).  \n\n[quote=&quot;HegemonKhan&quot;:l1y0mfwh]I wish I knew the math (actual measurements/metrics) of the physics/forces involved, but wouldn't the same be happening with your body when unprotected by a pressured space suit in outerspace, except in the opposite direction, as it's the outside (outerspace) which is the vacuum, and you the container have the pressure, so instead of crumpling (imploding), you'd explode?

In other words, they &quot;WANT&quot; to stick together.  This somewhat counters the pressure differences between your insides and outer space.  Also, on top of that, your vessels and skin (!) are quite elastic, so there's no explosive force.  There's a reason terrorist put pipe bombs in PIPES not latex balloons.  A related note... you would NOT want to hold your breath in outer space, because the gas in your lungs WILL expand (small-no cohesive forces).

It is ever cooling, however, and there are some pretty cool ideas on what happens when space does completely cool off, namely The Big Crunch Theory or the Big Freeze.

Certainly a concern, but in outer space, there isn't a ton of radiation unless you are relatively close to a nearby star.
