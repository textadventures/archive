I looked at the poster and was told looking at things is normally important but it's just an intro. That basically infers that nothing in the room is important.  Second.  I would recommend making your intro without repeatedly explaining it's an intro.  A good intro should provide all the information you need to start playing the game while feeling like you have already started playing the game.\r\n\r\nSide note.  Personally I find images in text adventure games detract from using ones own imagination.  Maybe that's just me?\r\n\r\nIf I finish playing the game later I will post more of my thoughts.  \r\nI hope you find this information useful.\r\nGood luck.",
