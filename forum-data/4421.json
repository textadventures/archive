The problem I am having is that when I try and connect that to certain &quot;ask&quot; topic with an NPC I get an error, the player's POV changes successfully but that big error message is ugly and will obviously not appeal to player's all that much.  Am I doing something wrong?  If anyone knows please contact me.  Maybe I can have you play the part where it happens so you can get another POV in....",

If you want to transform the player from one character to another in the same room (e.g. if you had Joe Blow who becomes a werewolf), then do this:\n\n1) Move the new POV character into the current room.\n2) Switch  the POV to the new character.\n3) Move the old POV charecter out of the current room to some other place, perhaps a holding room that the player can't normally get to.\n\nIf I've misunderstood what you're doing or if you have any questions, let me know.",
