But, if I accidentally sent you ... <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">several</span> e-mails, then I'm really sorry. Let me know if you want me to reformat this in a different way. I wasn't sure exactly how you were planning to use it, and I still have a saved copy without any tags or formatting.<br/><br/>On a related note, I have no logo for QuestComp. I had an idea, but can't really draw. I sketched a rough outline of what I had in mind, though. If anybody would like to make a nice logo for QuestComp, that would be great. If you want, you can use my idea here as a starting point.<br/><div><img src=\"/attachment/514\" alt=\"QuestCompSketch.png\" /></div>",
