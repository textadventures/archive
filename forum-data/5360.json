Cue background crowd sound - (MP3, ogg, other?)\n\nTurn script cues additional sounds - chanting, voices, beheading, etc - while background sound is playing - (MP3, ogg, other?)\n\nAll sounds stop when room is exited.  \n\nI haven't messed with it recently as I'm currently working on my ending - trying to save this blasted sound issue for last.  I'm just trying to get a head forward before I tackle it again.\n\nOr... And as a last resort, I could scrap the whole sound bit but I think it'll make the climax a bit stale without the sound.  Let me know.  Thanks silver.  Thanks all.",
