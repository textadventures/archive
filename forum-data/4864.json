Can this be disabled? It's not there when I run it through Quest on my desktop.\n\nI don't know if in deleting everything but the rooms I want testing, I inadvertently deleted some code that hides it, but it would be a real shame if it has to be there when playing online, as it's like an ugly wart on my game.\n\nSecondly, one part of the section I want testing uses a 'after a number of seconds' script, but online this is very erratic. Sometimes the script triggers immediately, sometimes after the correct 6 seconds, and sometimes not at all. It is imperative that the script waits the full six seconds, as it can be interrupted by the player to avoid death.\n\nI'm now guessing this script is reliant on the player's internet speed, and if that is the case, is there a better way to do this so that the player gets a fair shot at avoiding death?",
