      "EditableText": "Hello, \r\nI'm wondering if there is some way to work in code with gamebooks a variable that, depending on its value, will change what page a link sends you to.\r\nSay there was a variable for ammunition, and you have 28. If there is a page option for, \"try to blast down the baddies\", what I would want to happen is on clicking, the variable is compared to a required ammunition count for the page. If the ammo count is less than 30, it takes you to a page declaring you have failed to defeat the baddies, and your ammo is dropped to zero.\r\nBut, if your ammo was more than 30, it would take you to a page where you did defeat the baddies but you have 30 less ammo. \r\n\r\nHow would one achieve this? I am somewhat unfamiliar with coding, and it seems a lot of the codes people are working with are for text-adventures, not gamebooks. \r\n\r\nthank you!",
