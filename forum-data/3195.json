      "EditableText": "Hello there. I just published my first piece of a game I am working on. It is based on a mostly text-based browser MMO called Billy Vs. Snakeman (actually it's Billy Vs SNAKEMAN, but whatever). It's a small browser game on a cozy point of thems internets with a small but actually really nice community. It was first some sort of Naruto-parody, but eventually started absorving enough manga/anime references that it started to develop an original storyline of its own, which will be more or less used in this game I publish today.\n\nTechnically, it makes more sense if I call for testers from that gaming community (which I did already and got a couple volunteers), but I also would like to recruit people with no experience in that game whatsoever. People with some experience in interactive fiction already, so I can improve the chances of avoiding mistakes common to this kind of gaming. My biggest concern is keeping the moon logic and guess-the-verb issues under control, except that weird solutions are actually something intended (with proper in-game hinting, of course).\n\nThe game is right here. It's a very, very short thing that includes only one puzzle right off the bat, solvable in as few as 4, 5 commands if you know what you're doing (It is a wip, after all). Someone, please give this test a chance.\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.textadventures.co.uk/review/733/\">http://www.textadventures.co.uk/review/733/</a><!-- m -->",
