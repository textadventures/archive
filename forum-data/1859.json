I am aware of its limitations on the &quot;encryption&quot; factor, but it does deter those who just give up without even trying from looking at it. I like to believe that when I write a puzzle, that I give enough hints (sometimes too many) that this should not be an issue. Thats why I chose this software - the hard part is done, all I have to due is plug in my quest (I was originally, last year, writing a DOS engine (pascal then switched to VBDOS) to do just what QUEST does, but I found myself spending more time on the engine than my game sigh - so glad I found this). \n\nSpeaking of - isn't this topic of ASL vs CAS getting a little out of hand?  I think that if someone post &quot;.. i have a couple rooms done, would like someone the check to see how it looks so far&quot; would be a hint enough that the game is not complete, and the author is looking for some feed back as to whether s/he is on the right track. Whether they release an ASL or CAS file is purely rhetorical. The mere fact that the game is buggy just from those 2,3 or 5 rooms is information enough to report back to the author that &quot;... ok here are a couple bugs we found, and here is our suggestion&quot; NOT as to whether the author want to show the answers to the testers or not. And if the author is stumped, then they have the option of releasing the ASL file to maybe one or two people that would be happy to help find the bugs, or give them suggestions on a better way to write the routine.\n\nc'mon guys - lets work together.",

I like to believe that when I write a puzzle, that I give enough hints (sometimes too many) that this should not be an issue. Thats why I chose this software - the hard part is done, all I have to due is plug in my quest (I was originally, last year, writing a DOS engine (pascal then switched to VBDOS) to do just what QUEST does, but I found myself spending more time on the engine than my game sigh - so glad I found this). <br/><br/>Speaking of - isn't this topic of ASL vs CAS getting a little out of hand?  I think that if someone post &quot;.. i have a couple rooms done, would like someone the check to see how it looks so far&quot; would be a hint enough that the game is not complete, and the author is looking for some feed back as to whether s/he is on the right track. Whether they release an ASL or CAS file is purely rhetorical. The mere fact that the game is buggy just from those 2,3 or 5 rooms is information enough to report back to the author that &quot;... ok here are a couple bugs we found, and here is our suggestion&quot; NOT as to whether the author want to show the answers to the testers or not. And if the author is stumped, then they have the option of releasing the ASL file to maybe one or two people that would be happy to help find the bugs, or give them suggestions on a better way to write the routine.<br/><br/>c'mon guys - lets work together.",
