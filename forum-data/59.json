Especially in the way Quest is perceived by the RAI-F community at large.\n\nSome of you may feel inclined to add your voices to the discussion, and that's obviously a good thing, but if you do chip in, please refrain from using insulting personal abuse of the style that seems to have made an unwelcome appearance in these forums of late - it's pointlessly inflammatory, very childish and thus detracts from the crediblity of the writer's arguments.\n\nAl",
