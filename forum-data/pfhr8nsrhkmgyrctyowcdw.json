But I think it was running slow or something, so I clicked on a notification pop-up asking me to load some scripts from the website, which I did. Now all the data that I've been working on has been wiped and every time I try to edit the game it acts like I'm starting a new one from scratch. I published an unlisted version of the game earlier which still has all the previous data there so is there a way to work off of that or, at least, retrieve my data from this wiped version? Or would I have to use my unlisted version and work from scratch again which is something I really don't want to do since it took a while to get where I was at. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",
