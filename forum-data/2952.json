I was trying to add just &quot;use defibrillator&quot; as a call function, but I could not figure out how to make it work so I started the tutorial from scratch and was trying to do it from that point and found it worked instantly.  However, the turtorial states that if you go into kitchen it will still let you revive Bob which is a wonder since it is a whole room away.  Regardless, now when I try it it says-\n\n&quot;&gt; use defibrellator\nError running script&#058; No menu options specified&quot;\n\nIs this a saftey feature?  Since I could not get the call function to work properly to begin with I never got the chance to go to the kitchen and see what happens.  Also the &quot;Create Your Own Adventure&quot; books sounds fun too, I could use that for some other stories...   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->\n\n  Also I am assuming that you will eventually update the tutorial to match the newest interface or have different ones?  On 5.1 it said to go to Bob's Inventory and go to &quot;Use&quot; or &quot;Give&quot;, but I could not originally find it.  However, then I found that &quot;Use&quot; and &quot;Give&quot; have their own tab.  But in 5.2 they give you even more choices in &quot;Use&quot; and &quot;Give&quot;.",
