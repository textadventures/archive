      "EditableText": "I've spent half my day trying to get over this and reading for solutions on the docs and the forum, but nothing works, so I'm asking for your help.\r\n\r\nI want to have a system in my game, where the player can try his luck. His luck is a value between 0 and 10: 0 meaning he will never have luck, 10 meaning he will always have 100% luck (the latter will be unreachable). The player can try his luck in a battle and if he has luck, he doesn't take any damage from the battle.\r\n\r\nLogically I'm doing it with generating a random number between 1 and 10 during the battle and then checking: If Luck - Random Number <= 0: no luck. Else - congrats. Here is my code (obviously can be shortened, but I did it in many steps to trace my error - unsuccessfully :D ):\r\n\r\nFor generating the random number:\r\n\r\n    var randomnumber = function rng(min, max) {\r\n     return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min) + min);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    set (\"thisFight\", randomnumber(1,10));\r\n\r\nNow \"thisFight\" becomes the random number to compare with the luck value. It works so far, but then I have a problem:\r\n\r\n    set(\"winLose\", get(\"thisFight\") - get(\"luck\"));\r\n    @set winLose = @thisFight - @luck\r\n\r\nThis line is supposed to set the number, determining the outcome. Something here doesn't work, because it gives out \"null\" and nothing else. I've tried those two and everything inbetween, unsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nI also have a problem with presenting the outcome:\r\n\r\n    {if winLose<0:{You fail!, health-=10}}\r\n    {else:{Hooray! You win without a scratch!}}\r\n\r\nThese lines also don't work for some reason, even when I try them with a preset value!\r\n\r\nPlease help :D",
