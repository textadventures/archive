Alongside this is a list of recently edited games, with an 'Edit' button next to each.\n\nHowever, if I decide I want to work on another game, I find myself closing Quest and then reopening it so that I can access the recently edited list.\n\nIf I go to File &gt;&gt; Open for editing &gt;&gt; my game isn't where it should be. But if I check the folder manually, it is.\n\nI have a desktop folder called 'Aftermath' (the name of the game I will eventually release). In that folder I have another folder called 'Template' (which is another game file that I'm working on). Also in that folder is a 'game source' file called 'retrostyle'. If I navigate to this folder from File &gt;&gt; Opening game foe editing, only the restrostyle file is there??",
