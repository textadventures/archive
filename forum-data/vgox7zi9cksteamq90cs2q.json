These happen to behave oddly, and are often not interactable, and if they do, only small portions of the preview picture can be clicked.\r\n\r\nIt's of course nothign dramatic, but something you probably should be aware of. If this isn't reporducable on your end, i probably can provide pictures or a video, together with my specs and set-up.",
