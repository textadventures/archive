Soon after, there are wolves that eat you. There is some mud that makes you invisible, but the wolves still smell you and eat you.\r\nAnd... that's as far as I got!\r\nI know it's not much to go on, but does anyone know what game that is?\r\nIf it helps, I played it on a BBC around the same time as Lord of the Rings.\r\nMany thanks.",
