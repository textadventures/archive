      "EditableText": "Hello all, I  am working on a game based on the 60's Batman. So far I can get the player object to pull a lever and he changes his player object to his costume object and back again. I want to be able to do the same with Robin but as an Npc. I can get the Npc to the correct location but I can't figure out how to make him either switch to the costume as an Npc  or just wear the costume.\r\nI tried using the Wear command under Npc but he just holds it. Help!",

      "EditableText": "You can make it a 'cosmetic' switch.\r\n\r\nObjects come with the inbuilt attribute 'alias'. It's what you see ingame. So if you have JokerObject, with the JokerObject.alias=\"The Joker\", then ingame you'll see it called The Joker rather than JokerObject.\r\n\r\nYou can use this to make the switch. Taking the example of Bruce Wayne. Pardon my Psuedocode:\r\n```\r\nBatmanObject.alias=\"Bruce Wayne\"\r\nset BatmanObject.alias=\"Batman\"\r\n```\r\nYou can even make this do more than just affect their display names. For example, what if you Look At BatmanObject? Then you can have Look At run a script, one that prints different stuff depending on what BatmanObject's alias is:\r\n```\r\nif BatmanObject.alias=\"Bruce Wayne\":\r\n     print \"It's Bruce Wayne, the billionare. He's wearing a suit.\"\r\nelse if BatmanObject.alias=\"Batman\":\r\n      print \"It's Batman, Gotham's most famous vigilante. He's wearing his signature costume.\"\r\n```\r\nHope this helps!",
