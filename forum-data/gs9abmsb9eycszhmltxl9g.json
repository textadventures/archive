The object is moved into your inventory, and then if you look it is no longer in the room description. You can also add in an if script... so: if player is carrying (object) then msg - and type in a specific description for the room. This is nice if moving an object allows a player to notice something they wouldn't have otherwise.\r\n\r\nEdited to add: go to the left of your screen, scroll up to game, then click on the interface tab. Make sure show panes is clicked. Then go to room description and click automatically generate room description. If it is still not working, go to each object and make sure they are visible, and NOT part of scenery.",
