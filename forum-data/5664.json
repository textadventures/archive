Just create the verb 'eat' under the verb tab, add eat, and run the scripts you want to run.  The built-in edibles options never really worked well for me.\n\nAfter you 'go to sleep' in this tutorial, it gets a bit sloppy, but it's 3:20am here and I'm tired.  If you have questions or need clarification, please ask and I'll respond after I wake up!  Good luck!\n\nXanMag",
