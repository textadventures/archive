      "EditableText": "So.  I'm new to this game.  I'm making a Gamebook story.  I want to make it so that if you visited page \"A\", then when you're on page \"B\" a link will appear to page \"C\".  Seems simple.  I created a function to do this, which in code view is,\r\n\r\nif (HasSeenPage(A)) {\r\n  AddPageLink (B, C, \"text\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt doesn't work.  At all.  I've tried reversing B and C, because, why not, you could interpret it that way, but that doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nIs it something to do with Return Type or Parameters that I don't understand?\r\n\r\nThanks",
