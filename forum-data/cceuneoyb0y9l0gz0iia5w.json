If yes please let me know how it is done.\r\n2. Rephrasing again, I'm not talking about HTML CSS hosting, I'm talking about ```dot.quest``` file.\r\n3. I created a game and I would like to host it on my server, what are the all different possibilities?\r\n\r\nI hope I was able to convey what I want to ask if anyone knows how to configure such a server, please let me know. **Thankyou in advance**\r\n\r\n\r\n",
