You can set a script to run when an object is picked up.\r\nThere are four things you probably want to do. I'll include lines of code because they're easy to copy and paste. You can open the script in code view and paste the lines in; and then if you prefer GUI view you can see what they look like.\r\n\r\n1. Tell the player what's happened:\r\n<pre style=\"margin-left: 3em\"><code>msg (\"As soon as you pick up the book, there is a flash and you find yourself in a different place.\")</code></pre>\r\n\r\n2. Put the book in the player's inventory:\r\n<pre style=\"margin-left: 3em\"><code>AddToInventory (this)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n3. Teleport the player\r\n<pre style=\"margin-left: 3em\"><code>MoveObject (game.pov, <em style=\"color:blue; font-weight: bold\">another room</em>)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n4. (optional) If you only want this to happen the _first_ time the book is picked up, change its take behaviour back to the default:\r\n<pre style=\"margin-left: 3em\"><code>SetObjectFlagOn (this, \"take\")</code></pre>\r\n\r\nIn the code above I've used two special expressions; `this` is shorthand for \"the object this script is attached to\", so you don't need to worry about changing the script if you decide to change the book's name later; and `game.pov` means the object that the player is currently controlling (named \"player\" by default, but it's safer to use `game.pov` because that's always valid).\r\n\r\nI've also mentioned `another room`, which you need to replace with the name of the room you want to teleport the player to.",
