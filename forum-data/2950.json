      "EditableText": "Hello.  I am new to this kind of gaming.  I searched and found this tool kit and have been tinkering with the tutorial.  So far everything is working, but now I am stuck on “Intermediate 4. More Things To Do With Objects”.  It says that I need to go into Bob's Inventory and scroll down to the Use box and select “Handle objects individually”.  And in the picture it shows there is also a Give box.  However, when I click on “my” version of Bob and go to Inventory and scroll down, there is neither a Give nor a Use box to select anything from.  Why is that?  I have done everything that I am aware of from the tutorial and I have even deleted and recreated Bob from scratch just in case I had added a special command or verb by mistake, (Read another forum post with that problem.) and redid everything, but still, there is no Give or Use box only an option to run another script, but the tutorial does not say anything about this.  I tried to do this with and with out the defibrillator, but still nothing.  Any idea what I am doing wrong?  I am using Quest 5.1.1 if it helps at all.\n\n[quote:3sswcvfr]Please read this before asking for help\n\nby Alex » Fri Apr 13, 2012 8:21 am \n\nIf something's not working in your game and you don't know why, it will help us to help you if you attach your game file.\n\nYou can do this using the &quot;Upload attachment&quot; tab which appears under the Submit/Preview/Save Draft buttons when posting.[/quote:3sswcvfr] \n\nI am sorry I do not know or understand how to do this.  Is this from with the Quest Editor or from this forum itself?\n\n  Secondly, I am actually trying to play some text adventure games both for enjoyment, but to also get some inspiration for my own game, but as I said before, I have not really played them before.  I am getting very frustrated with the commands.  I do not know even a quarter of them and when I type “help” it gives me a minute amount of choices... “help” is suppose to list all commands I would assume, not give me the most basic and the ones I already know of.  How do I find a complete list?  I even checked both the Quest wiki page and the forum and did searches there and found nothing.  I even checked the web and came up with only a handful more of commands with them saying half the fun is trying out different things and finding them yourself or reading the manuals.  So about five websites and I do not know how many redirects to find... nothing.  It is frustrating me to no end.  I am trying Shipwrecked, The Mansion and Barbarian.  On Shipwrecked I had to cheat and scroll down to see I had to use “flip over *object*” just to make an object do so.  As if “use” or “flip *object*” was not enough .  In The Mansion I am stuck with an object I took from something and now can not get out of the room, because the doors are locked.  Yet I have no idea how to place the object I took back where it goes.  “Use” does nothing.  I do not see the fun in trying something several times and getting some kind of answer of it doesn't work.  I do not mind exploring nor do I mind making mistakes and then finding a solution to the problem and or puzzles.  But what it boils down to is where is the basic manual for all or at least the majority of games and then where are the files for these three games, particularly Shipwrecked that has it's special commands?  (Barbarian actually has a special command box to click for stuff like “wield” and “mount”.)  I feel like I am a foreigner in another country with no language book, asking the same three phrases that I know and watch people shrug their shoulders, scratch their heads or say “Sorry I do not understand.” over and over again.  Can you help me please?  I am sure there are others that would need the same type of help, especially new people.  Also in The Mansion it says to “look at map” to see the map, yet when I do a little box shows up on the game screen with a red “x”, assuming it means it is no longer functioning.  And also it seems that some times when I start that game (Only tried three so far.) it gives me an error that it can not start, but at other times it works.\n\n  Sorry if this second part does not officially belong here, but thought it best to kill two birds with one stone.  If not I can also make this as a suggestion, the second part that is.  Thank you.",

I am not saying we can not have trial and error in the game, as in you got caught in a trap or the monster killed you or you have to solve a puzzle.  But having to go through a dictionary or using synonyms to figure out what exactly the game maker wanted us to use for his game is crazy!  The games are meant to be played for fun and story, not to try every word in existance and then find out he had a special word for it and on top of that you had to use it in combonation with a phrase and or object exactly.  In other words &quot;wield&quot;, &quot;equip&quot;, &quot;hold&quot; was not enough.  The game creator wanted you to type &quot;handle&quot; and then not just &quot;handle axe&quot;, but &quot;handle the axe in right hand&quot;.  I mean it is stuff like that that ruins the game play for me.  It is like I know something is there and spend a few minutes or even an hour trying the same room knowing something is there, but then give up and spend lost time in other places trying to find something that is in the room I had originally thought it was in, but I lacked the commands to properly attain it.  I do not want my hand held, but I do need to know the commands in order to even try and procede through the game.\n\n[quote:24ebsf3e]It's probably a better idea to familiarize yourself with the traditions of Interactive Fiction/Text Adventure games before trying to make them yourself though, but that's just my suggestion.[/quote:24ebsf3e]\n\nToo late.  Already started.    <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->   Already have some rooms up with descriptions and plenty of things to look at, with a huge story already thought out.  (Will have to make chapters.)  Of course nothing major is happening, but I can settle for making rooms now and then get further in depth when I get through the tutorial and research the other commands.  And I will have to check out that site, which I thank you by the way.

I am not saying we can not have trial and error in the game, as in you got caught in a trap or the monster killed you or you have to solve a puzzle.  But having to go through a dictionary or using synonyms to figure out what exactly the game maker wanted us to use for his game is crazy!  The games are meant to be played for fun and story, not to try every word in existance and then find out he had a special word for it and on top of that you had to use it in combonation with a phrase and or object exactly.  In other words &quot;wield&quot;, &quot;equip&quot;, &quot;hold&quot; was not enough.  The game creator wanted you to type &quot;handle&quot; and then not just &quot;handle axe&quot;, but &quot;handle the axe in right hand&quot;.  I mean it is stuff like that that ruins the game play for me.  It is like I know something is there and spend a few minutes or even an hour trying the same room knowing something is there, but then give up and spend lost time in other places trying to find something that is in the room I had originally thought it was in, but I lacked the commands to properly attain it.  I do not want my hand held, but I do need to know the commands in order to even try and procede through the game.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>It's probably a better idea to familiarize yourself with the traditions of Interactive Fiction/Text Adventure games before trying to make them yourself though, but that's just my suggestion.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Too late.

Of course nothing major is happening, but I can settle for making rooms now and then get further in depth when I get through the tutorial and research the other commands.

The guess work is not the problem.  It is the fact that certain games are so precise with the wording that if you do not do it exactly, you can do nothing and as is here, there is no help sheet with commands even when you type &quot;help&quot;.  I am not worried about having a huge world to explore, nor am I worried about trial and error in regards to gameplay it self.  But in actually &quot;playing&quot; the &quot;game&quot; I have to know the commands.  I know I can not be the only newbie with this problem.  From my understanding games of this type when they came out came with a manual when you paid for them.  I am assuming they gave all basic commands, plus some, if not all, special commands unique to that game.  I could be wrong, but that is what I have read on other websites.  If anything, (Besides actually telling me the majority of the commands, although I will check out that site still.) can you point me to a game or two where the author actually gave a large list of commands?  I think that will just be better.  I know when I create my game I will have the sheet for others to actually enjoy the game opposed to be put off by knowing only a few commands or not at all.  (Like who would know to &quot;examine&quot; something for further detail, when &quot;look&quot; already gives you details?  You might as well type &quot;scrutinize&quot; and hope to find something even more better than &quot;examine&quot;.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE:  After that link you had showed me for the help card which was useful, I got redirected to another site called Brass Lantern and there is a beginners guide and [b:2m2k60bg][i:2m2k60bg][u:2m2k60bg]THAT[/u:2m2k60bg][/i:2m2k60bg][/b:2m2k60bg] is very helpful!  It gives many commands although still talks about unique ones to the games themselves, but it gives a plarentha of commands to try and I am already getting past some of the parts I was before stuck at, although it was still not a complete list, but as you have said I doubt there could be a 100% list of them.  Now all I need is to figure out how to upload my problem with the tutorial so I can proceed.\n\n  However, reading that site gives me other questions although I can probably ask there, I will instead ask here since I have Quest.  First, can I play other games made on different tool kits on Quest, even old PC and Amiga ones?  I mean if it is parser based?  Like TADS and I guess HUGO. (I did not check Hugo's website.)  And why does Brass Lantern only carry seven of your games where in TADS they have like two hundred of them?  Also it does not or hardly even mention Quest and there is no Quest link when it shows a chart of TADS, HUGO, PC, AMIGA etc..  TADS I am assuming is straight up computer code from what I have seen and is definitely no go for me.  So why is Quest not more welcomed, supported and or acknowledged?  Actually I found out about Quest from the wiki under Text Games and or IF.  Finally, once I create my game using Quest, can others using different programs run Quest or do they have to download Quest in order to play it or that is why there is a browser based Quest now?",

The alpha build will be nothing but rooms with all the descriptions and backstories etc.  Beta will be where the rooms and enviroment will be acting as they should and the final should be when weapons and health and the like are implimented and maybe even a few sounds... just depends on how it flows with the story.  We will see.  I do not know how to script so hopefully Quest will at least let me have attack commands and the like implemented easily, along with magic etc.  If not I guess I can learn to script for that little bit.  But if I have to script every single room from scratch I never would have started and is the reason I chose Quest.",

I'm close to finishing my game, so if you're interested maybe you could PM me with an outline and maybe there could be some sort of collaboration? Just a thought. I've been looking to do a collab and my last couple never even got much into the planning stages before they fizzled out so I figured it was worth a shot.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>  Well actually the story I have in mind is one I have had for a while now and just have not gotten to write it yet, (I have way too many stories in my head... no less than five to ten at any given moment...) but I think it would fit perfectly for this game.  However, I am sorry, but with this being my first game and all I do not want to do a collab.  However, if people such as your self and or others help with any problems that may arise I definitely will give a &quot;Special Thanks&quot; in my credits.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Most people starting with Quest think, they can do great games without scripting, just working with the gui.

I believe I have found the problem to my tutorial, sadly it was after I redid the tutorial up to that part, but to be honest I needed to redo it anyway and probably will most likely redo it even a third and fourth time.  Regardless, per the wiki tutorial (Maybe it is using Quest 4?) it says on Bob's Inventory, including a screen shot, to scroll down to the &quot;Use&quot; and &quot;Give&quot; boxes and to go from there.  I could not find out where it was even though I was in Bob's Inventory screen.  But, my eye caught that there is a whole separate tab for just &quot;Use/Give&quot;.  So I clicked on it and followed the procedure as is instructed and it works.  Bob is now alive... so I am not sure when the screen shot and or the tutorial was created, but it was wrong on that little part, unless I have a unique Quest 5 and I doubt it or no one updated it or felt the need to update it and I am just a little slow.  I try to follow the tutorial to the letter when it comes to making commands and such.",
