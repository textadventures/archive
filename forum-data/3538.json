      "EditableText": "This is a fundmental design consideration with Quest, and not a bug as such: you cannot modify a list while it's being enumerated with foreach. In your case, you are executing &quot;foreach&quot; in function use_container. Inside this foreach loop, you invoke &quot;useinstack&quot; on the object which destroys itself when done. When you destroy an object, Quest automatically sets all references to it to null and removes it from all containers that contain it. So it is removed from the list which still has an active &quot;foreach&quot; going on.\n\nWhen the foreach resumes, it throws the error.\n\nIt might seem like it's working, but the foreach actually terminates at that point (and probably all code after it).\n\nThere are a few ways around this, but they all involve changing your design slightly. Either the object shouldn't destroy itself, or the loop you use can be changed to a for loop, executing over the items in a different way. Or objects which are meant to be destroyed get moved to a holding place, which is then destroyed later. Or perhaps something else...\n\nBut touching a list while it's being enumerated is a no-no.",
