I'm considering using it to develop a game for a jam on Game Jolt, but I am unsure whether Quest will publish in a format that will allow its inclusion on that site. According to the tutorial, the game produces a *.quest file for publication. How is this file utilized when presenting the game on a third party site like Game Jolt, or selling it on itch.io?\n\nWould I be better off using a different toolset for such purposes, or is Quest suitable for this?\n\nThank you.",

It also hosts a variety of whatever game jams its members decide to host. \n\nThe information in that link you provided is actually what prompted me to ask my questions. Knowing that it specifically states that whatever I make is free to be shared, sold, or whatever, what I am asking is *how* am I to accomplish the feat of making my game available on third party sites? I have not yet discovered a means of compiling it into a stand alone application, and as far as I know there is no means to easily do this. \n\nHow do you publish something as your own game when it is in a format that will not run on its own?",
