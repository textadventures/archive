Kind of curious if anyone's done this before, so maybe I can compare how we approached things.\r\n\r\nI've already built my own clothing system, because I wanted to put clothes on characters other than the player, and have the bonuses work correctly when I use ChangePOV. Then I've got a script that has an NPC wander around randomly within a particular area, pick up items and put them back in their original locations, put any junk the player leaves lying around in a couple of dedicated \"tidyup\" containers, run a script when she enters your room or vice versa, and display a \"you hear footsteps\" message based on how far away you are.\r\n\r\nBut now I'm working on a random maze generator. And I'd very much like to see how anyone else has approached this challenge. Also, if you've thought about doing one, what features should it have? I'm trying to make it as flexible as possible.",

      "EditableText": "Nice :) I didn't think of dungeon crawls.\r\n\r\nSo far mine's just moving stuff around so the rooms in a house aren't always arranged the same way. At present it shuffles around the rooms within a container. I'm planning to have it so that, for example, it will ensure that a key is placed on the right side of a door. Maybe also allow generic rooms to be duplicated as necessary.\r\n\r\nTurning out to be quite a fun project to work on :)",
