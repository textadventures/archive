It really discourages me from finishing my game, and it's been a dream of mine since about 22 years ago when I  was in 7th or 8th grade trying to learn Basic. I want to finish this game, but the QDK issues and response time is starting to destroy my happiness. The problem is that I get in the mood to work on the game, a problem arises, and then by the time someone gets back to me or it's solved, I'm on to recording music or writing a book or something else. And it always seems I'm the only one who experiences the problems I do, so some special magical remedy has to be discovered and applied. Why do you think v4.02 (i think it was) added the option to turn off or on abbreviated commands? Yep. That was me. I couldn't figure out why I was getting a conflict when I'd type in &quot;get screw&quot;. Well... there was a &quot;screwdriver&quot; also. Quest couldn't discern the difference between the &quot;s-c-r-e-w&quot; and the &quot;s-c-r-e-w-driver&quot;. So, because I thought I goofed up, I started reworking my code in a new way, and found out in the end it wasn't my coding. By that time, my brain was forgetting what did what and which way it did whatever it was trying to do. Hell, I don't even know where the new code ends and the old code starts. And I was like half way done with my game, and it's getting fairly big. Oh well. So I urged and urged Alex to put the option to turn on or off abbreviated commands, and he did, and I'm thankful for that! I always thought abbreviated commands were getting out of hand and just made the player lazy anyhow. &quot;get cr&quot; or &quot;move te&quot; is just a bunch of garbage, and makes the game less realistic. Hey Thanatos! &quot;How yo d go? Mi is fi.&quot; Lol!",
