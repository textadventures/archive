I solved the problem by making a function. In this function I run a script with caption, there is a question and three options to choose. For the sake of semplicity, the options are: sit, stand and remain immobile. After the player choice, I run a switch for the result, and print a certain message when player sit or stand. But, when he chooses to remain immobile, I print a message and then I call again the function.\r\n (It's a little bit more complicated than that, because I made a counter that goes up everytime the player chooses to remain immobile, for the sake of printing a message when he reaches a certain point. But that's not the problem.)\r\nSo, in the game, when player eneters the room I call the function and the loop stuff works fine. But, if I add after the \"call function\" another script, this will be run at the same time. Is there a way to \"pause\" other scripts while the function is running?",

I don't have Quest on this computer, but I think you can use a condition like: `if (not HasScript (game, \"menucallback\"))` to make sure there isn't a menu, and if so do the next thing.
