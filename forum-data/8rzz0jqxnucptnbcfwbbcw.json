I think it would be in the top 10 if it allowed us to undo our mistakes, but, the way things stand, it has less than 1,000 plays.  That's sad, too, because it really is an excellent game (besides the lack of UNDO).\r\n\r\nYou see, we're doing a lot of work when we're playing a text adventure, and we don't always know what to do next (no matter how simple the author may believe a puzzle is;  the author thinks it's all easy to figure out because the author wrote it).  One mistake should not cause the player to have to start a text adventure over from the beginning (or from a save point).\r\n\r\n---\r\nBesides, even if it *was* cheating, do players not have the right to cheat?\r\n\r\nEver heard of the GameShark?  Or the GameFAQs website?  Or Nintendo Power?\r\n\r\nHeck, all we have to do is unzip a Quest game and open the game file in a text editor to see all the code (and we can even modify things).\r\n\r\n---\r\n...and wouldn't you consider restarting the game to go back and enter the correct command the same thing as entering UNDO to go back and enter the correct command? The only difference being the player has to do more work without undo?\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm not trying to tell you how to make your game.
