      "EditableText": "Citizen of Nowhere is not a Quest game (it's an Inform 7 game), but it was written by NecroDeath (he wrote every one of his previous games with Quest). It's a good game, and its play count is impressively higher ever time I look at it. (I am admittedly biased, as I am friends with this author.)\r\n\r\nI couldn't get into the other two games under \"Editor's Picks\".\r\n\r\nI vote Citizen of Nowhere remains there, unless, of course, the editor has another game in mind, in which case I wouldn't cry or complain or anything. :)\r\n\r\nI also vote that [the first Xanadu game](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/sihv9g3rdki50mt9_1v4bq/xanadu-the-worlds-only-hope) is added to \"Editor's Picks\". It's pretty good, and it's actually a Quest game. (I am admittedly biased, as I am friends with this author, too.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n[Detectiveland](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/wcxyblcktksx6ljky_pz7w/detectiveland) is not a classic game. It came out in 2016. It may be in the style of the classic games (sort of), but it's definitely not a classic. (Note that I did enjoy it somewhat. It was well made. Just not an actual classic.)\r\n\r\nNeither is [Galatea](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/emrhyy7pp0c8bjkjeuhs-g/galatea). Although it was released in 2000, I wouldn't call it a classic (no offense to Emily Short, who is a very awesome person). First, I was raised to believe something has to be at least twenty-five years old to be considered a classic (or an antique). Second, all you do in the game is talk to a statue. It is cool, but it is not very much of an adventure.\r\n\r\nZork is definitely a classic, but the link needs to be fixed so people can save and restore their progress in that Parchment version of it.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, clicking \"Play online\" opens a page with the game loaded in an iframe, which messes up the way saving and restoring works when playing games using Parchment.\r\n\r\nClicking \"Play online\" should really take the player to this link: https://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5\r\n\r\nNote that the player would still need to copy the URL after saving and paste that in to restore (alternatively, they could bookmark it), but that's just because of Parchment's crappy save feature. It is better than not being able to save and restore Zork at all, though!\r\n\r\n... but I guess the whole point is that the games are hosted on this site.\r\n\r\nHrmm... Well, I vote Zork stays. Even with the saving and restoring issue, it still has 1,170,346 plays. I mean, that's pretty impressive; right?\r\n\r\n---\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nI guess we can't use my definition of \"classic\". Nothing made after 1996 would be allowed if we did!\r\n\r\n(I know, I know. I'm not very much help, but I try!)\r\n\r\nWould [Moquette](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/zbzfpcnknu_vdjog-cbihw/moquette) count as a Classic Quest game?",
