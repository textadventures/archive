Any number of spaces, linebreaks, or other whitespace characters are treated like a single space.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add whitespace, you'll have to use HTML or CSS styling.\r\n\r\nIf you want to indent one paragraph, you could use a blank image. For example, entering this:\r\n```\r\n<img style=\"width: 1em\">Here's a paragraph with a space in front of it. The width is given as \"1em\", which is the width of a letter 'm', but you could just as easily say '2en' for the width of 2 'n's, or 1cm, or 0.5in (but you should be careful about cm and inches, because you don't know what size the player's screen is)\r\n```\r\nand it will appear like this:\r\n<img style=\"width: 1em\">Here's a paragraph with a space in front of it. The width is given as \"1em\", which is the width of a letter 'm', but you could just as easily say '2en' for the width of 2 'n's, or 1cm, or 0.5in (but you should be careful about cm and inches, because you don't know what size the player's screen is)\r\n\r\nIf you want to indent all paragraphs, you could output this HTML:\r\n```\r\n<style>#divOutput > div {text-indent: 1em}</style>\r\n```\r\nWhich won't appear on its own, but will make all paragraphs have a 1em indent until it's removed (for example by clearing the screen).\r\n\r\nIf you want to indent all paragraphs, then you could use Javascript to put it outside the output area. Then it would survive being cleared:\r\n```\r\nJS.eval(\"$('<style>').appendTo('head').text('#divOutput > div {text-indent: 1em}')\")\r\n```\r\nThat won't be affected by clearing the screen, but won't be preserved when the game is saved; so if you're making a text adventure, you'd want to put it in the 'UI initialisation' script (on the Advanced Scripts tab), which is run at the start of a new game or when a saved game is loaded; then it will always be in effect.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: fixed a silly mistake in the CSS)",
