After reading and watching several tutorials I'm still not sure whether the following things are possible in Quest, for example:\r\n\r\nLets say there is a room. Inside are 3 containers (a,b,c). Every time, I open one container for the first time, it shoulf contain randomised items (x,y,z). After opening it, the content stays the same, like a real container. \r\nBox A should be more likely to contain items from x, than y and z. Box b should contain more likely items from z, than x and y and so on. So every box has a different chance to contain different content based on percentage (?!) every time opend for the first time. I hope this makes sense Oo.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to create some sort of database, where I store all items, sorted by different categories (material, use, weight, etc) so the boxes a,b,c can use that data to create their contents?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nkarg",

      "EditableText": "Yes what you want to do is possible. For the randomization you can use [RandomChance](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/corelibrary/randomchance.html) to create a percent chance of something happening, or for even greater control I'd personally use [GetRandomInt](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/getrandomint.html) and then check it against my own numbers.\r\n\r\nAs for item categories you have a couple options there as well. The first would be [object types](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/using_types.html), which allow you to assign a specific type to the object which you can check for as well as allowing you to add specific attributes to the type itself that all objects of that type will automatically be given.\r\n\r\nYou can also store items outside the game area ie: in a room or object that the player can never reach or see. Then use other objects for categories to hold the items themselves, kinda like a filing cabinet or the way folders work on a computer. I use this one when I quite a bit when I have a lot of scripts controlling a certain aspect of the game. ei: object named control -> contains object named combat -> combat has all the scripts and attributes for combat related things.\r\n\r\nNow from your description it sounds like you want to create more sorted lists of your objects more than specific categories. What you'll want for this would be either a [list](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/using_lists.html) or a [dictionary](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/using_dictionaries.html). They are very similar in function however dictionary items aren't specifically ordered, so you'll likely want a list. Fortunately the sorting part is fairly easy as there is a function just for that, [ObjectListSort](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/objectlistsort.html)\r\n\r\nFor the listing and sorting I'd also include those in the game startup then you can reference those lists as needed.",
