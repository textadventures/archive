I follow what they say to a tee, yet when I turn on the object and then try to look at it again, the response is the same as it was before I turned on the object. I am a beginner to Quest and I really like the program, but this one bug is bothering me quite a bit. I appreciate any help I can get.",

Safe1 is the one without the clue and as soon as you find the clue, the first safe is hidden and the second one will appear. Give them the same player alias and they can't see the safe has changed without interacting.\n\nI hope this helps <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
