He got an A and we have been toying around with qdk ever since. Now a few years ago, I stopped coding and life got in the way, you know how it is. So about a week ago I got back on the quest website to download quest again and found 2 versions. I got 4 my brother got 5, we gonna compare notes and such. I thought I would write a very simple, very short game about a wizard that has to save his &quot;sister wizard&quot; from an accident involving a spell she was casting. Well, like I said, that was a week ago. I have almost finished the main house in the map. I still need about 4 more rooms to sum it up. Then I need a map of the garden outside the house, a map of the village, a map of the forest, a map of the lake, and a map of the desert. I haven't even started on the actual quest or mission yet and I am already up to  (according to my word processor)...wait for it...wait for it...63 PAGES of code. So much for a small, short, simple game. ROFLOL Having fun with the challenge though. I just didn't know my imagination was so extensive. I had to open a whole new file called &quot;to do.txt&quot; just to keep track of everything I need to add, tweak, or edit as other things in the game get coded. It's a pretty long list. This is fun. Hopefully, once I finish, if I can keep going without a complete meltdown lol, I can get it uploaded so you all can enjoy. I already have several friends IRL that said, hey I feel nostalgic too. I remember the 80's, give me a copy of that game.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
