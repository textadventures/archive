I also thought it would be neat if someone like my brother, or my cousin (who is actually a professional web-designer) could make/publish their own games under the same &quot;company&quot; username, where we would each include our real name under author for the games we make; while Quest is pretty simple to use, it might also be cool to have more than one person actually login and work on a single game project. Normally, I would assume that was a big no-no with any website, but it seems like it would make sense here, and I can't find anything that actually says it's against the rules.\n\nCan I do any of that? Or do I just need to stick with publishing the game as unlisted for people to help me test it?\nIf that is the case, I'm also curious how it will work out if I publish a game in mid-production and then need to publish it again later. Will it automatically overwrite the outdated version, or will there be multiple instances to clear-out and delete?",
