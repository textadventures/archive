Find that file <a href=\"https://github.com/textadventures/quest/tree/master/WorldModel/WorldModel/Core\">in the Core libraries</a>.\r\n4. Copy the entire contents of that file (excluding the `<library>` at the start and `</library>` at the end) into your ASLX file, replacing the `<include` line.\r\n5. Repeat the steps so far for all the other `<include` lines (you can probably skip the ones with `Editor` in the filename, and just delete the `<include>`)\r\n6.
