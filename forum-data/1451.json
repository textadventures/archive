And so far things are going well:\nI have sorted out a system for equipping weapons, and unequipping Them. But i wanted to have a window showing what you had wielded. Like a status variable So for the equip command i have the code as follows: \n[quote:2aezw714]\ncommand &lt;wield #@wep#&gt; if property &lt;#@wep#; equipable&gt; and got &lt;#@wep#&gt; and not flag &lt;wep on&gt; then {\n\t\tmsg &lt;You Equip #@wep#&gt;\n\t\tflag on &lt;wep on&gt;\n\t\tproperty &lt;#@wep#; wielded&gt;\n\t\tset string &lt;wield; #@wep#&gt;\n[/quote:2aezw714]\n\nBut when i try and equip a weapon it Just crashes, Is there a way to do this without it crashing (i would like to not have to use a command to look at what it is, such as wielding or something, but can if needs be)\n\noh and the status variable is a local string\nThanks in advance",
