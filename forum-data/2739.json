You could also download manually from the website using your browser, and then open them from the File menu.\n\nFor schools, I'm thinking of having the ability to set up separate &quot;areas&quot;, so you could only allow students to download games from your own mini version of the site. This could be customised with just the games you want to permit. Students could submit games to their own school mini-site as well. Maybe that's overkill for your purposes?\n\nAnother way would be to have a particular registry setting to filter the list. Would that be something easy to deploy over the school network?",
