Also, the search bar at the bottom just searches google, not the forums. So you can imagine why I'm asking the question instead of just poring over the forums looking for it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my question is: How do you play games you've downloaded off the site?\r\n\r\nOf course, I'm new here. And I don't have much experience with coding or programs and such. Therefore, when I downloaded a game (specifically Avast Ye Mateys), I just tried opening the file. With notepad. I'm sure that's amusing to anyone who actually knows what they're doing.\r\n\r\nSo can someone please explain to me the process of opening the game and making it playable?\r\n\r\nMuch obliged.\r\n\r\nCheers",
