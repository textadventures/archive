Rather, some text will explain your situation and then you will be offered several options to choose from. For example:\n[i:21chw4n9]You're in a dark room. What do you do?\n- turn on the light\n- run around bumping into things\n- lie down and go to sleep[/i:21chw4n9]\nIs Quest capable of this?\n\n2) Can Quest run in full screen mode?\n3) Can Quest play \"movies\" (or animated GIFs, if need be) in full screen mode? Can these movies have sound?\n\n\nthanks for putting up with me  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->",
