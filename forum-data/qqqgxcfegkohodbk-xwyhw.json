      "EditableText": "Hello.\r\n\r\nRecently, I found that I couldn't run the Squiffy editor in any recent version of any flavor of Linux.  It worked on Windows 10, but running it on Linux was a bust.\r\n\r\nSo, after doing some research, I found that we could update Electron from version 1.8.1 to version 4.2.12 to fix this issue.  I have tested my fix in all the flavors of Linux except Gentoo and Debian, and it works.\r\n\r\nI do not have a Mac, though.  So, I'm hoping someone will spend 30 minutes (or less) building the Squiffy editor on a Mac using the source code from [my fork](https://github.com/KVonGit/squiffy-editor) on GitHub to see if everything works.\r\n\r\nThere were two issues.\r\n\r\n1. On Windows and Linux, jquery was not being copied into the proper place in the build.  I fixed this by editing \"gulpfile.js\".\r\n2. On Linux, there was a Pango error which said the Harfbuzz version was too old.  This was a bug in Electron, and it was fixed in version 4.x.x. So, I updated the Electron version from 1.8.1 to 4.2.12.  This works on Windows and on Linux.  I edited \"gulpfile.js\" and \"package.json\" to update the version of Electron.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI want to create a pull request so this gets updated in the real version of the Squiffy editor, but I want to make sure it doesn't introduce any issues for Mac users before I do it.",
