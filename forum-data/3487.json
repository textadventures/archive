If he wants to open a door he would have to put down that particular item.\n\nAgain i don't understand any of the coding stuff and i'm not sure if it's possible without it. Thanks.",

That's the direction i was going, how would i do the same for example 50 items would i have to change the take menu on every item or is there any easier way? I don't know a whole lot about it. Also is there a way to extend that restriction to the open/close command? Thanks again",
