So I'm well aware that I'm not a talented artist with images. However, I do want something simple that looks like it might've been on a game box in the late 70's, not a high-class cgi full portrait. I'm just afraid maybe this is TOO bad. So, what do you think, is this worth including as cover art?\nAlso, please tell me what you think is going on in this picture, so I can tell if it even conveys what it's supposed to.",

If I have to draw something I employ minimalism and self-deprecating remarks, which appears to be your strategy as well.\n\nAs far as what is happening in the picture, I can tell that there is a cart being pulled away from the perspective through a forest.  On the cart is a bowl of some stuff and... a closed bag with lumpy contents?  And then, of course, in front of the cart is some magical/supernatural energy of varying colors.\n\nIn my experience any art is better than no art, and the longer you stare at this, the more you'll know what you want it to look like (and how to get it there).  In general, if you [i:2bk675w4]have[/i:2bk675w4] to ask about the quality of your work, you should put more work into it.  Not necessarily because it's not good enough, but because you're not happy with it.  It's going to be the face of your hard work, the player's first impression, and whether or not players as a whole will like it, you should be happy with it before you use it.  There's no deadline for this, I'm assuming, so just let it settle in your mind until you can come up with something you don't feel the need to ask about.\nAnother thing I would recommend is to just play around with your tools as much as possible.  I've been using GIMP on and off for years on whatever took my fancy and it's made me much more competent artistically (from the level of a 1-year-old with no arms to the level of a 4-year-old missing some fingers), but it also helped me get from point A to B more proficiently, which makes a lot of difference with digital art.",
