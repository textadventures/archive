Games either go in the &quot;Sandpit&quot; if they're not a real game (we get quite a lot of test games set in a house... sigh), or they go into a proper category.\n\nIf you'd like to volunteer, please let me know and I'll give your account access.\n\nAlso if anyone has any feedback on the available categories, that would be great. I've just been through a load of games and ended up categorising them as &quot;Mystery&quot;, when what we really need is a &quot;Puzzle&quot; category I suppose. Also I guess there should be an option for authors to suggest a category so that we don't have to work it out ourselves.",
