      "EditableText": "Anyone have any experience using ToInt with String Lists? I have a string list of numbers that I need to check against a case switch, and apparently I need to use ToInt in there somewhere, but I'm kinda lost. Here's what I'm trying to do:\n\nI have a variable called alibi_die that's set to a random number between 1 and 10. Then, depending on the number, the case switch sets the alibi attribute of the current object to the string I have set. But, I want to have a check in place so that if the number generated has already been used, it generates a new number. This ensures that all the &quot;suspects&quot; have a unique alibi. All of the case switch scripts add the number of that alibi to a string list I created called chosen_alibi. Here's the code I have so far:\n\n[code:3ekvy60t]\nchosen_alibis = NewStringList()\n        alibi_die = &quot;&quot;\n        while (alibi_die = &quot;&quot; or ListContains(chosen_alibis, alibi_die)) {\n          alibi_die = GetRandomInt(1,10)\n          switch (alibi_die) {\n            case (1) {\n              current_suspect&#46;alibi = current_suspect&#46;firstname+&quot; shrugs nonchalantly and says, \\&quot;&quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_person&#46;firstname+&quot; and I spent the entire evening together in the &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_room&#46;alias+&quot;&#46; You've got your work cut out for you on this one, inspector&#46; None of us cared much for &quot;+game&#46;victim&#46;firstname+&quot;, and that's the truth&#46; Frankly, whoever did it deserves a medal&#46;\\&quot;&quot;\n              list add (chosen_alibis, &quot;1&quot;)\n            }\n            case (2) {\n              current_suspect&#46;alibi = current_suspect&#46;firstname+&quot; replies haughtily, \\&quot;I spent the entire evening with &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_person&#46;firstname+&quot; in the &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_room&#46;alias+&quot;&#46; Of course we both despised &quot;+game&#46;victim&#46;firstname+&quot;--but then, so did everyone else in the house&#46; Frankly, I think you should just leave well enough alone&#46;\\&quot;&quot;\n              list add (chosen_alibis, &quot;2&quot;)\n            }\n            case (3) {\n              current_suspect&#46;alibi = current_suspect&#46;firstname+&quot; sneers wickedly and replies, \\&quot;I spent the entire evening with &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_person&#46;firstname+&quot; in the &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_room&#46;alias+&quot;&#46; And I simply cannot believe that anyone in this house would have had the bad taste to commit murder&#46;&#46;&#46; Though I sometimes think that &quot;+game&#46;murderer&#46;firstname+&quot; is capable of almost anything&#46;\\&quot;&quot;\n              list add (chosen_alibis, &quot;3&quot;)\n            }\n            case (4) {\n              current_suspect&#46;alibi = current_suspect&#46;firstname+&quot; shrugs nonchalantly and says, \\&quot;&quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_person&#46;firstname+&quot; and I spent the entire evening together in the &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_room&#46;alias+&quot;&#46; Far be it from me to meddle in your affairs, inspector, but I really think you should question &quot;+game&#46;murderer&#46;firstname+&quot;&#46; Why just the other day &quot;+game&#46;murderer&#46;firstname+&quot; told me that &quot;+game&#46;victim&#46;firstname+&quot; would be better off dead&#46;\\&quot;&quot;\n              list add (chosen_alibis, &quot;4&quot;)\n            }\n            case (5) {\n              current_suspect&#46;alibi = current_suspect&#46;firstname+&quot; looks up from the floor and says, \\&quot;I spent the entire evening with &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_person&#46;firstname+&quot; in the &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_room&#46;alias+&quot;&#46; Why, I didn't even find out about &quot;+game&#46;victim&#46;firstname+&quot;'s death until right before you arrived&#46; Isn't it awful&#46; Who do you think could do such a thing!?!\\&quot;&quot;\n              list add (chosen_alibis, &quot;5&quot;)\n            }\n            case (6) {\n              current_suspect&#46;alibi = current_suspect&#46;firstname+&quot; forces a laugh and replies, \\&quot;&quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_person&#46;firstname+&quot; and I spent the entire evening together in the &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_room&#46;alias+&quot;&#46; Now just between you and me and the walls, inspector, I admired &quot;+game&#46;victim&#46;firstname+&quot; greatly&#46; Wouldn't want the others to know about my little soft spot though&#46;\\&quot;&quot;\n              list add (chosen_alibis, &quot;6&quot;)\n            }\n            case (7) {\n              current_suspect&#46;alibi = current_suspect&#46;firstname+&quot; turns away from you and murmurs, \\&quot;I spent the entire evening with &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_person&#46;firstname+&quot; in the &quot;+current_suspect&#46;alibi_room&#46;alias+&quot;&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46; I'm just so shocked by this whole affair&#46; Murder is such an ugly business, don't you think?

      "EditableText": "Wow, yeah that probably would help wouldn't it? Here's the code for the whole function. It does loop through every suspect in the game already. First it checks if the suspect was alone, and if so picks a random alibi from a separate list, then if not, is supposed to pick a random alibi from the regular list. What I want is for the game to keep track of which alibis have been picked from the regular list so that if the same number comes up again, it gets re-rolled.
