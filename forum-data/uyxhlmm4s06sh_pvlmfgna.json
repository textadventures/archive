Find a bonus that's hard to find and get some score. Then, you can use your score to buy cheats if you're stuck, or so people that have already played can unlock their favourite content.\r\n\r\nSo, how can I work something like, \"If player score = 10, run script, else 'You need more score!'\" in any simple method. Is there a simple method?",

One could always create a more robust/complex/advanced system/functionality, as there's no in general limit on coding possibility/creativity/robustness/complexity/advancement: take for an analogy, you can always create a bigger/better house)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It's quicker/easier for me to help via code, so just ignore my posts or just the code parts of my post, as indeed, if you don't already know coding, looking-at/seeing code is quite confusing/meaningless/overwhelming/scary/terrorifying, etc.</p>\n<p>I still like to post code, because if people can somewhat read/understanding it, they can at least see the 'if'/etc logic/mindset involved, which is important/neccessary for game making, even if not doing any coding.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>if I'm not lazy and I got the time... I'll help on how to do stuff through the GUI/Editor, but not often anymore (and I don't know the GUI/Editor stuff that well, also).</p>\n\n",
