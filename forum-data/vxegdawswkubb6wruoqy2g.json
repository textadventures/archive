I hope you're all doing fine given the present circumstances and looking after yourselves and your loved ones.\r\n\r\nA while back I was helped with generating a colour code system for a lock puzzle - it worked really well and  I trimmed it down to this:\r\n\r\n```c_list = Split(\"Black;Brown;Red;Orange;Yellow;Green;Blue;Violet;Grey;White;Gold;Silver\", \";\")\r\ngame.plain_code = \"\"\r\ngame.coloured_code = \"\"\r\nfor (i, 1, 4) {\r\n  randomcolour = PickOneString(c_list)\r\n  game.plain_code = Trim(game.plain_code) + \" \" + randomcolour\r\n  game.coloured_code = Trim(game.coloured_code) + \" \" + \"{colour:\" + randomcolour + \":\" + randomcolour + \"}\"\r\n}\r\nmsg (\"The plain code is \" + game.plain_code)\r\nmsg (\"And the coloured code is \" + game.coloured_code)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem I have now is when it prints out in colour and the colour matches the background you can't see it. Before I used pictures as backgrounds and was acceptable, but now I just want plain black or white backgrounds.\r\n\r\nHow and where in this code can I use the \"background-color: thistle\" to seperate background from foreground please?\r\n\r\nI have tried:\r\n```\r\ngame.coloured_code = Trim(game.coloured_code) + \" \" + \"{background-color: thistle; colour:\" + randomcolour + \":\" + randomcolour + \"}\"\r\n```\r\nbut all I get is the code printed to the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys,\r\n\r\n-=Darchy=-\r\n",
