This acts as a proxy and sits between players connecting via Telnet and QuestNet Server, converting commands into a form the server can recognise and filtering the output so the player's screens aren't filled with garbage. It works fairly well but it's not especially pretty since it just uses the most basic form of Telnet, so there's no nice GUI or anything.",
