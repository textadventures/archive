I already learned how to do this by inserting {player.gender} into script, but I'd like to expand on the gender selection by inserting some sort of \"if\" \"then\" script.

      "EditableText": "i don't know if there is another method, but it's very simple.\r\nYou will need to post the code in the if section, exactly. Use the GUI to be more sure of what you do.\r\n1) First, you will need to ask your player. You can ask by a 'get input' or by a menu, and store in an **attribute**\r\nI suppose you have done it like the tuturial Character creation, with a menu:\r\n```\r\nshow menu (\"Your gender?\", Split (\"Male;Female\", \";\"), false) {\r\n    player.gender = result\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI removed all the elements that we don't need presentment. I hope you recognize the code\r\n\r\nplayer.gender contains, when the player has finished it's character creation \"Male\" or \"Female\"\r\nIf you used it now, You will have, for exemple when the player meet a new person.\r\n\"Male, I'm the new neighbors\" or \"Female, I'm the new neighbors\"\r\nIt's not very good, no ?\r\n\r\n2) Change Male by Dude/Guy/Sir... and change as the game progress.\r\nYes, there is again two method to do it. You can fix it in the start of the game, or you can allow that to change as the game progress. \r\nTo allow changing as the game progress, you will need a **function**. It is a system to not repeat a lot of time the same line.\r\nYou will see the Function menu near the end of the list of your objects. (go to http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/creating_functions_which_return_a_value.html if you're not sure about creating a function )\r\n\r\n2A) Creation of the function\r\n\r\nGo for it, and create a new one. Name it as you want (like \"PrintGender\").\r\nYour function will return a **string**, that means some words, that you just have to print in your message.\r\nThe code will be this one at first. You can change it when you want.\r\n```\r\nif(player.gender=\"Male\"){\r\n    return(\"Sir\")\r\n}else if(player.gender=\"Female\"){\r\n    return(\"Madam\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt is the basic skeleton to be functional. It will return \"Sir\" if it is a Male, and \"Madam\" if it is a Female.\r\n\r\n2B) Usage of the function\r\nIn your adventure, whenever you want to print Sir Or Madam, you just have to _call function_ by the GUI and give it your name to use it.\r\nexemple :\r\nI met a new person on the road. \"Hi\", I said, \"who are you ?\". \"{PrintGreeting()}, I'm one of your new neighbors !\"\r\n\r\nIt should display if it is a Male\r\nI met a new person on the road. \"Hi\", I said, \"who are you ?\". \"Sir, I'm one of your new neighbors !\"\r\nor if it is a Female\r\nI met a new person on the road. \"Hi\", I said, \"who are you ?\". \"Madam, I'm one of your new neighbors !\"\r\n\r\nIs the objective get ? \r\nWhy a third point will you ask ? Because, one day or another, you will need to have different reaction from different type of character the player meets. How to do it ?\r\nYou will have to go to your function and complexify a little\r\n\r\n3) Overriding the default value of the function\r\nWhen it is the father/mother / brother/sister / or best friend, thing will change. It will be very strange your bff say to you \"Sir\" or \"Madam\", don't you agree ?\r\nYou will notice in the GUI of your function, the possibility to add **parameters**. There you can define your overridingMale, and overridingFemale title. (Remember the order, though)\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(player.gender=\"Male\"){\r\n    if(Trim(overridingMale)=\"\"){\r\n        return(\"Sir\")\r\n    }else{\r\n        return(overridingMale)\r\n    }\r\n}else if(player.gender=\"Female\"){\r\n    if(Trim(overridingFemale)=\"\"){\r\n        return(\"Madam\")\r\n    }else{\r\n        return(overridingFemale)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n We have tested if the parameter has something, and if it has, we return this parameter. Else, we stick with the default case\r\n\r\nexemple 1 :\r\nI met a new person on the road. \"Hi\", I said, \"who are you ?\". \"{PrintGreeting(\"\",\"\")}, I'm one of your new neighbors !\"\r\n\r\nIt should display if it is a Male\r\nI met a new person on the road. \"Hi\", I said, \"who are you ?\". \"Sir, I'm one of your new neighbors !\"\r\nor if it is a Female\r\nI met a new person on the road. \"Hi\", I said, \"who are you ?\". \"Madam, I'm one of your new neighbors !\"\r\n\r\nexemple 2 :\r\nI met my brother on the side of the road. \"Hi Greg\", I said, \"what are you doing ?\". \"{PrintGreeting(\"Dude\",\"Sis'\")}, I'm on my way to school, want to join me ?\"\r\n\r\nIt should display if it is a Male\r\nI met my brother on the side of the road. \"Hi Greg\", I said, \"what are you doing ?\". \"Dude, I'm on my way to school, want to join me ?\"\r\nor if it is a Female\r\nI met my brother on the side of the road. \"Hi Greg\", I said, \"what are you doing ?\". \"Sis', I'm on my way to school, want to join me ?\"\r\n\r\nBetter, don't you think so ?\r\n\r\n\r\n@mrangel \r\nOh either ! I didn't knew about it. Cool !",
