You state in the manual that the player should just get over their opponent not co-operating, but would it work like that in the real world? The other guy is an employee too. If the boss says 'pin the opponent at the 60 second mark,' he would do it if he wanted to get paid. \n\nThe jobber is given a certain number of offences. Fine, but if that's the case, doing nothing should ALWAYS be an option after those offences have been made, so reputation points will be given fairly, not with-held because a jobber can only attack over and over.\n\nI hope this feedback helps. All the best with improving the game and making more.",

It also doesn't cost any stamina to perform. However it comes under &quot;3 times in a row&quot; rule.\n-- &quot;Submission&quot; is an offensive move. Performing it will add +1 to your &quot;Offense Counter&quot;.\n-- Be careful with performing &quot;Offense&quot; move twice in a row. If the opponent blocks the move the second time, you will be forced to perform it the third time. This is where &quot;the opponent is not cooperating with me&quot; thing comes. When you are in the ring trying to put on a good match, the miscalculations can happen. Your opponent has also has his own moves to worry about.\n\nExcellent idea. <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: --> I will get that added in.",
