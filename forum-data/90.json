QDK doesn't store the game in memory as ASL, which is why if you resave ASL in QDK you'll notice things may have moved around. This means there's no reliable way to keep track of where comments should be. If QDK read a comment that was about a particular line of code, it may end up being saved somewhere completely different. I can't think of a good way around this problem. If you need to combine QDK with manual ASL coding, I suggest you store any comments as QDK notes. Off the top of my head the syntax for these, if you're writing them manually, is\n\n'!qdk-note &lt;Note text&gt;",
