      "EditableText": "I really cannot recall any example from the top of my head, but I think it is perfectly viable.\r\n\r\nSome time in the past, when I was just evaluating some writing possibilities, this very same idea came across my mind. Actually, when it first came into my mind, I was considering the possibility of player controlling a bunch of characters and elements at the same time. It was like presenting scenes and the player choosing what happens to each scene in general terms, including multiple characters' actions and external events.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I found doing something like this would undermine the character point of view, so I moved into the idea of writing at third person, yes, but keeping chasing a single character, so the player would follow and control only this character. My main motivation for focusing in a single character was trying to hold a strong grip on character development. The player would observe better and choose better for the transitions of a single character, instead of a bunch of them. Or at least I think at the moment I have enough skill to handle only a character at once if I want having some quality in the game.\r\n\r\nI did read a lot about te topic, including some ideas from Emily Short. Most of the IF designers defends the first person point of view arguing it would ensure the player's immersion into the game, but I sincerely disagree. I find perfectly possible the player creating a relation to the character if you tell the story in second person, what would bring me a couple of bonuses.\r\n\r\nThe first good point is that I could present and develop a character better. By giving the player an external character, it becomes easier for the player accepting a fully modeled character. I am not saying it is impossible. Tabletop roleplaying games does that every day. You invite the player to play as \"Raistling Magere\" - what comes to be a very well rounded and developed character - and the player does it nicely in first person. But for the IF community, I thought it could be a shock in a first project, so I could avoid the conflict. When trying to ensure first person and that the player wears the characters shoes, it usually commits the sin of vagueness. Characters are vague, descriptions are vague, everything to not step into the player's imagination. However all this vagueness also pushes the player away from having a grasp into the decisions, because vagueness means lack of information.\r\n\r\nThe second important topic I found was that most people complain in IFs that the options presented (In game books, where is my main interest) are not things they would do. And they complain because the first person / character vague narratives is made to convince they are the character. But the game has not the options they would take, and... well.. it goes round and round. By taking a third person narrative you may deliver a character. So, everything that happens and the choices are tailored for the character and not for the player. If your character is a pacifist, you dont need considering \"punch the guard in the face\" because the character would never do that.  Players also complains things like \"the text cannot state what I am thinking\" when yu write a line such as \"You think the man would be drunk\". But if you are handling  character, the player would not be offended.\r\n\r\nI suppose in future I will have tools enough to deliver the player a full defined character and convey a first person narrative just as I do as RPG Game Master, but for now, my first formal IF project, I decided going these lines.\r\n\r\nI hope all of this helps you on your IF journeys.",
