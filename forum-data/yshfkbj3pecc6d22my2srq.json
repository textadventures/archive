The engine is pretty solid so it's more about commenting on the story, general interactions and such.\r\n\r\nThe game takes about 2h to complete - there is a lot to read. The format is a SMS chats where the player chooses his answers, there is ambient music. The theme is Hackers, cyber-security, paranoia, conspiracy. \r\n\r\nIt's our first full narrative game, the testing is done on Android through Google Play.\r\nIf anyone is interested, send me a message, and we can talk more about this opportunity.\r\n\r\nthanks for reading :)\r\nIanic",
