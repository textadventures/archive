      "EditableText": "1) Inside the loop have it check for a property such as 'takeable', give this property to all takeable objects.\n\n2) Making something invisible means it's not listed, but still can be interacted with. Unavailable, means you can't interact in any way.\n\n3) Invisible makes things invisible, useful for objects you want people to read about in the description and not appear in the list, pointing at a clue like a huge arrow.\n\n4) Have a flag, which is initially off, when the player enters the room (flag = off) print the first message then switch it on. When they enter again and the flag is on, have it print the other message/whatever. Alternatively to a flag, have it as a property on the room, in fact I think Alex did this for the latest Quest, its name is 'visited', but it auomagically turns off after their first visit and is a nice way of doing what you want.",
