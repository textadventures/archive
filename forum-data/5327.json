Multiple things need to happen to it before it can be used properly.  It must be (1) taped and (2) cut with a knife THEN (3) filled with ice THEN (4) filled with the proper 'chemicals'.  To represent this in the game, I have four lunchboxes.  The first is empty.  When taped, I move the empty one to a dead room and add the taped one to the inventory.  When it is cut, I move the taped one to the dead room and the taped/cut one to the inventory.  When that is filled... yada yada yada... you get the point.  So, at the end of the procedure, the player has taped, cut, filled, and filled the lunchbox.  At this point it can be used to achieve desired effect.\n\nMy problem is this.  What if the player does things out of order?  For example, a logical thing to do is put ice in a thermal lunchbox, but I do not want that to happen before it is taped and cut.  Easy, right?  My initial thought was to do an 'If/Then/Else'.  When the player tries to take the ice, If 'player is carrying lunchbox (the normal one)', 'Then' 'print message' &quot;You have the right idea here, but the lunchbox is not ready to receive the ice&quot; and the 'Else' would be &quot;You consider picking up the ice, but it would melt too quickly in your hot, sweaty hands.&quot;  \n\nBUT... as soon as the lunchbox is taped and the normal lunchbox is swapped out, then I will always see the 'Else' message.  This is where I stopped messing with it because I see serious confusion for me down the road.\n\nI hope you all get the idea.  It's kind of complicated.  Is there an easier way of tackling this than what I have designed?  Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT:  Just thought of this... Could I use one flag (say 'CPS') to control all of that?  Flag goes up when adding a lunchbox... make the lunchbox undroppable... and have one default else under a command for each lunchbox that says something simple, like &quot;Good idea, but not yet!&quot;",

In mine I use the &quot;remove object&quot; so its no longer there.  e.g. once an apple on stick has been created, the apple is removed and the stick is removed they no longer exist and apple on stick is added to the players inventory.",
