      "EditableText": "CSIDE (the _ChoiceScript Integrated Development Environment_) is a new, free, community-driven application for developing long-form, multiple-choice Interactive Fiction (or, more succinctly, _Interactive Novels_) using the ChoiceScript scripting language.\r\n\r\nMany of these games go on to be published (as Web, iOS, Android & even Steam apps) by _Choice of Games LLC_, the creators of ChoiceScript—either directly or under their _Hosted Games_ label—and can in fact earn quite substantial  royalties for their authors. 'Choice Games' are one of the most popular, growing and commercially-successful forms of traditional (CYOA-style) IF on the market today, with new releases enjoyed by tens of thousands of players every month.\r\n\r\nWhile ChoiceScript has occasionally proven difficult for some budding new writers to learn, especially non-programmers struggling with the scripting side of things, the community team behind the CSIDE project aims to change all that. More than three years in development / beta testing and only recently released to the public, CSIDE's design draws on a wealth of experience to remove every possible hardship or chore from writing and coding with ChoiceScript, leaving only the fun, creative bits for you.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a host of useful features and functions, also included within CSIDE is a detailed, step-by-step Interactive Tutorial—_Learning Basic ChoiceScript_—designed to help you progress at your own pace as well as introduce you to the basic workings of CSIDE itself. This tutorial is especially aimed at newcomers in general and non-programmers in particular, and has itself been written by a non-programmer. Using ChoiceScript, of all things. :)\r\n\r\nAs the actual author of this Tutorial—and a long-time CSIDE beta tester and design contributor—I need your help!  Now that CSIDE has finally been released to a grateful, ChoiceScript-writing audience, I am seeking a few kind souls from outside our core community to provide genuine \"newcomer\" feedback and in doing so enable me to tweak and refine our Interactive Tutorial, to make absolutely sure it actually does the job it's intended to do.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'm looking for a few writers / game developers who are passionate about creating great IF but have never  before tried ChoiceScript, perhaps have never even heard of it, and most especially any who may have actually tried it in the past but found that \"old way\" of doing things just too tedious, unhelpful or downright frustrating to persevere with…\r\n\r\nIs that you? Are you genuinely interested in learning to develop with ChoiceScript, whether for a decent sideline 'hobby' income or just for sheer creative fun?\r\n\r\nIf so, please give it a go and let me know what you think!
