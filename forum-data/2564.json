JBGamer's the handle, and yes, it's not terribly original but I've been calling myself that before I even knew of the internet--maybe even before the internet was invented.  My eventual goal with Quest is to make a game based on JRPGs, though I probably won't be able to do something that elaborate, and I might have other options for making the idea I have into this game as well besides text-based in the future.  I've loved the idea of text based games since I was a kid, so I was very pleased when I found this site.  Hi!",
