Can you show us the code that isn't working?\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that  the scope only determines which objects are considered natural targets for a command. When the player types the alias of an object, first their input will be compared to the list of objects in scope, and if it doesn't match any of those it will be compared to the list of all objects the player can see. So if the player enters an object that isn't in scope, the command still needs to check and come up with its own error message.",
