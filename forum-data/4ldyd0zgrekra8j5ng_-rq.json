      "EditableText": "Hello,\r\nIn one of my games I intend that the player can be possibly poisoned by an object like a giant viper. I tried to run a turn script which, every 10 turns, if the player object had the flag \"poisoned\", would be supposed to take one hitpoint away. Instead, it waits 10 turns and then takes away 1 hitpoint per turn continually. Can anyone help with this?",
