I think it's very powerful, and for the game I'm designing I'm sure Quest has the tools for bringing it to life.\n\nBut I have no idea how to do it.\n\nMy game has levels. I'm not talking about the physical levels, like levels in a building, but stages, the Mario World 1-2, 1-3, etc. I understand the up-down exits. What I want to be able to do is have the player go to a different room with the entire map clearing, or being erased. Kind of like how you can erase previous text. When the player leaves the apartment and goes to the bank, the apartment text is cleared and the bank text begins. I want apartment map to clear and the bank map to be free.\n\nIs there anyway to do this? Thanks for any help, it's this or bust for me, and I really like the map mechanic.",
