If selected, the conversation automatically continues, if there are still options available. There is also a &quot;force conversation&quot; option, if selected the player will have to select a conversation option before moving on (by default the player can choose to ignore the list of options and do something else). Note that if both options are selected, and you have topics that do not disappear after they are used, the player could get stuck in a loop, so be careful![/i:1w65mqc0]\n\n[i:1w65mqc0]ETA3: Another update (09/Dec/15), for version 5.[/i:1w65mqc0]\n\nYou can replace any existing version with this version, and your game should still work fine (but might be a good idea to rename the old version rather than over-writing or deleting it, just in case).\n\nLibrary:\n[attachment=0:1w65mqc0]<!-- ia0 -->ConvLib.aslx<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:1w65mqc0]\n\nDemo: \n[attachment=1:1w65mqc0]<!-- ia1 -->ConvDemo.aslx<!-- ia1 -->[/attachment:1w65mqc0]\n\nThe instructions here are still useful:\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/libraries/dynamic_menus_for_conversations.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... tions.html</a><!-- m -->\n\n[i:1w65mqc0]As of this version, version 5:[/i:1w65mqc0]\n\nVersion 5 has a text box for the greeting, like thgere is for each topic.\nIt also has an option to add a terminator to an active conversation\n(i.e., a topic that allows the player to leave the conversation).\n\n[i:1w65mqc0]As of this version, version 4:[/i:1w65mqc0]\n\nYou now get a text area for conversation topics, and you can just type the exchange in there, rather than as a script (the script option is still there, and will be run after the text is displayed; both are optional).\n\n[i:1w65mqc0]As of version 3:[/i:1w65mqc0]\n\nYou can also move all your topics for a person into its own room.

The 'active conversation' option is good too, as it saves the player having to type 'talk to...' each time they want to progress a conversation, and it feels more immersive.\n\nWhen using active conversations (especially ones where topics don't disappear), I was wondering if there is a way to have a conversation topic that effectively stops the conversation, making the menu disappear even if there are still options to choose from? For example, most conversations in RPGs I've played have a 'goodbye' option that allows players to leave before exhausting all the available topics. \n\nIt would be especially useful to be able to do this in 'forced' conversations, too, i.e. the player would have to progress a certain way through the dialogue (but not necessarily all of it) before they can stop the conversation.",
