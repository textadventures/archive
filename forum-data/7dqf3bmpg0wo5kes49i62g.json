You won't know how to do everything, but you'll know what you want -- which, as G.I. Joe will tell you (repeatedly, whether you want him to or not), \"knowing is half the battle.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you have any questions, be sure to ask!</p>\n<p>I wasn't trying to dissuade from that. I just realized that I had written a lot of code that might end up in your game, and my code examples are more like a rough sketch of how to start coding things than they are finalized version to use in an otherwise carefully crafted text adventure.</p>\n\n",
