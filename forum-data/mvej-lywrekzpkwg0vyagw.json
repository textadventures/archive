I wanted to add everything possible to software I loved to make it even better, but I now realize the error of my ways.\r\n\r\nI'm also sorry for disappearing just after Quest 5.8 was released and not being around to help when my code started causing people problems. I just recently started helping someone with their Quest game, and I experienced the issues I created first hand before returning here to find a few forum posts with people pulling their hair out because enabling the transcript messes up the turn scripts.\r\n\r\nThere are also posts about how the new `clearScreen()` functionality is slowing down games that print a good amount of text, because it no longer deletes the cleared text from the document by default. (This is coupled with a JS string variable which is also saving every bit of text that prints.)\r\n\r\nI have been working around the clock for the past few days to get all the issues I introduced resolved, and I ***believe*** most of the wrinkles have now been ironed out.\r\n\r\nIf anyone running Quest on Windows would like to test out the recent build with the proposed bug-fixes, it is currently here: \r\n\r\nhttps://textmisadventures.github.io/quest/ <-- updated 2024-12-12\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to look at all the changes, the pull requests are here: https://github.com/textadventures/quest/pull\r\n\r\n---\r\nLast but not least, I would like to apologize to mrangel.\r\n\r\nI added bits of code from his forum posts to Quest 5.8 without consulting him first. I tend to butt into threads when he is already helping someone, and most times I exacerbate things. And he was pretty much the only one left in the forums to help people when my code caused problems.\r\n\r\nSorry about all that, mrangel.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAnyway, I am hoping I've gotten all the issues I introduced in Quest 5.8 fixed.\r\n\r\nAny feedback concerning the bug-fixes would be greatly appreciated.
