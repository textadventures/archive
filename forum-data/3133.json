      "EditableText": "Here is my first tip: timerevents are bad style, especially if you have only 5 seconds to find and type the right word. I would stop playing such a game immediately. If you still want to do it this way, you should add as many possible phrases, not only 'duck'. So it should be possible to 'lie', 'lie down', 'duck down','dodge'... (by the way, what happens if you leave the room with the arrow?) Remember, it should not be your goal to frustrate your players, but to please them. \n\nSo, you have created a timer. Now you need a new command smething like this:\n[attachment=0:22pffnmr]<!-- ia0 -->timer.jpg<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:22pffnmr]",

There are just too many variables, like people's typing speeds, typos, etc. that will probably just make it too frustrating.",
