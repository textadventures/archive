I have created (well started to) an 'Equip' menu so that a player can choose what Armour \n\nor Weapon to use.\nIs it possible to have separate sub-menus within the Equip menu for each of these ?  How \n\ncould I code that ?\n\n2. I'd like to be able to populate the choices on each submenu according to what is in the \n\nplayer's inventory, after checking that the choices on say the 'Weapon' submenu of the \n\n'Equip' are actually of type Weapon, which I have defined as a type.\n\nCheers,\n\nRW",
