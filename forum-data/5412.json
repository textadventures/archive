I'm still just getting <br/><br/>blah blah blah lots of text () ....argh. <br/><br/>I pretty much write everything in a script form. This is what I have exactly...<br/><br/>(&quot;{if player.race=elven: paying particular attention to the color of your glowing {player.eyecolor} eyes}&quot;)<br/><br/>which seems to be what you all are talking about me thinks. <br/><br/>@ Pertex<br/><blockquote><p>Perhaps your variable player.race is not set properly?</p></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm pretty sure it's set properly. The Character Creator works great and so do a lot of the other little tidbits like, for example {player.eyecolor} eyes and so forth throughout the text. It only doesn't seem to be working when I try that stuff above. Of course, I'm just a newbie at this though so maybe I'm missing something. <br/><br/>-------------------------<br/>Hk, by the way! Have you been working on your game? Also, Alex took care of the listing for my game. So the next update I do, I can upload to the Quest website too. Weee! <br/><br/>Hey Jayna, how've you been?",
