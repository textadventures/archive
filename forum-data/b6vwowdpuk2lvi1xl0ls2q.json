It works fine on desktop. \r\n\r\nWhen I run my game on a mobile (Chrome) browser, the sounds don't play. But when I switch Chrome on Android to 'Desktop site', my game plays its sounds correctly, just like on the desktop. \r\n\r\nSo, it seems like the problem has nothing to do with the sound files. Could this be a bug in Quest, in whatever code is run when adapting the interface to mobile?\r\n",
