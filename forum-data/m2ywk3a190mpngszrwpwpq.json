Descriptions for exits do not exist, but you can make some by running a script instead of the standard code, printing a message and then moving the player to the desired location. If you are missing the compass, that usually involves JavaScript and/or .css, and I'm not fluent in either. Alternatively, you may have turned the compass to false on accident, and need to turn it to true again.",
