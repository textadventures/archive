Just more curiosity of mine in what can be coded, and not, in my slow steps to try to understand more about coding and coding-logic)\n\n---------------\n\naside from anything fancy Jayna can probably do, there's at least three basic ways for it to be done (you can choose which you'd like best, and then we can help you do it that way):\n\n1. (as Jayna said) simply make~create (Add) a Verb for each: ie a &quot;Climb~Get On&quot;, a &quot;Jump On&quot;, and a &quot;Stand On&quot; Verb, so you'll have 3 Verb buttons and blue hyperlinks to click on.\n\n&quot;blah&quot; Object -&gt; Verb (Tab) -&gt; Add -&gt; (repeat this 3 times: and see below)\n\nAdded Verb: #1\nName: Climb~Get On\nScript&#058; Run as a script -&gt; Add a script -&gt; Print a message [EXPRESSION] &quot;You climb on the &quot; + this.alias + &quot;.&quot; // (or: this.name, if you're didn't set the &quot;alias&quot; Attribute, ie didn't type something in the &quot;Alias&quot; box, under whatever Tab, I think it's the first ~left most~ Tab, whatever it is called)\n\n// = these double forward slashes is the syntax~format~&quot;coding&quot; for when you're coding, to tell the game engine that this line is just a comment by you, and not coding for it to try to run, so when you see me using these &quot;//&quot; it's merely my comments to you\n\n// &quot;this&quot; for within a Verb, can be used to &quot;Get&quot; the Object that the you added the Verb to, thus allowing you to also &quot;Get&quot; the Object's Attribute (for example): this.alias\n\n// an example: &quot;player&quot; (Player Object) -&gt; &quot;Alias&quot; Attribute: HK -&gt; Verb (Tab) -&gt; Add -&gt; &quot;Greetings&quot; -&gt; Print a message -&gt; EXPRESSION -&gt; &quot;Hi, my name is &quot; + this.alias + &quot;.&quot; -&gt; Output during game play: Hi, my name is HK. // or, if you used &quot;this.name&quot;, then the output would be: Hi, my name is player.\n\nAdded Verb: #2\nName: Jump On\nScript&#058; Run as a script -&gt; Add a script -&gt; Print a message [EXPRESSION] &quot;You jump on the &quot; + this.alias + &quot;.&quot;\n\nAdded Verb: #3\nName: Stand On\nScript&#058; Run as a script -&gt; Add a script -&gt; Print a message [EXPRESSION] &quot;You stand on the &quot; + this.alias + &quot;.&quot;\n\n2. Commands enable the user (person playing your game) to type in what they want to do, but it is otherwise the same as a Verb, we'd have to create 3 Commands for each of the actions~Scripts (&quot;Climb~Get On&quot;, a &quot;Jump On&quot;, and a &quot;Stand On&quot;) that you want.\n\n3. You can use the &quot;show a menu&quot; Script, which causes a pop-up menu window of choices, which we can use to select which of the 3 actions~Scripts (&quot;Climb~Get On&quot;, a &quot;Jump On&quot;, and a &quot;Stand On&quot;) that you would like done.\n\n-------------------\n\nif you want to use Commands or &quot;show menu&quot; Script instead, let me know, and I'll help you do those.\n\nIf you need any help or are confused at all with my post, let me know, and I'll try to be more clear or help you better.\n\n------------------\n\nP.S.\n\nwithin the GUI~Editor, there's a toggle button to switch between &quot;GUI~Editor mode&quot; and &quot;Code View mode&quot; at the top of the screen, it's between the &quot;play&quot; and the &quot;?~help&quot; buttons, and it looks like a piece of note paper. When you're in the Code View mode, if you don't mind sharing your game code~game making, you can highlight your game code (or just a part of it), copy it, and then paste it here, within this &quot;coding&quot; (as it's otherwise messy if you don't):\n\n[code.]paste your game code here[/code.]\n\nbut without the dots within the brackets\n\nit looks like this:\n\n[code:ekb6vzx0]Starting a new game, the default game code (well, I'm still using the older 540 version of quest, lol)&#58;\n\n&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;d67ec73f-f879-4911-9d88-c02ea527c534&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2013&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:ekb6vzx0]\n\n-----------------------\n\nP.S.\n\nwriting out: Print a message -&gt; EXPRESSIONS -&gt;\n\nIn Code (easier~quicker to type for me, lol):\n\n[code:ekb6vzx0]msg (&quot;Hi, my name is &quot; + player&#46;alias + &quot;&#46; I'm a &quot; + player&#46;gender_string + player&#46;age_string + player&#46;class_string + &quot;, with &quot; + player&#46;skin_color_string + &quot; skin, &quot; + player&#46;eye_color_string + &quot; eyes, and &quot; + player&#46;hair_color_string + &quot; hair&#46;&quot;)[/code:ekb6vzx0]\n\nit would look (output during game play) like this (A lot of these are custom ~self made-added and set-configured~ attributes that I add to my games):\n\nHi, my name is HK.
