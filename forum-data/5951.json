      "EditableText": "Can you change an object to scenery when you add it to your inventory?  Or, in some other way make an object not show up in the inventory after you pick it up?\n\nI understand there is a 'wearables' library, but I don't want it that in depth.  Just simple.  Let's say, I just have a sweatshirt that I can put on or go in the default description tee-shirt...\n\nAll I want to accomplish is, when the player decides to &quot;wear&quot; sweatshirt, I set a flag that will change the 'x me' description indicating the player is wearing the sweatshirt, but I do not want the sweatshirt to show up in the inventory, only in the player description.  Also, if possible, I would like to avoid making it 'invisible' because I would like be able to 'look at sweatshirt' and would like to also add the verb &quot;remove&quot; to the sweatshirt.  If it is invisible, that is impossible, correct?  I also know, but want to avoid, that I could add a global command like 'remove sweatshirt' and check to see if the flag indicating the sweatshirt is worn, then add it to inventory or current room.\n\nHelp is appreciated!  Thanks!",
