In the attached file you will find the library, renamed Combat1FR.aslx and Pixie's demo game, which I have re-created from scratch. As far as I can see, this seems to work.\n\nA very interesting and useful work, at least for me: I have learnt quite a lot of things, and I hope that others will find it useful, too.\nOne small problem: the message that appears when the player is killed and has lost the game has not been translated in the French core library. How can I fix that?\n\nThanks to you, Pixie  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> \n\nThierry",
