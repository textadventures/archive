Well seeing as I ain't gonna be finishing that game anytime soon (damn homework), I decided I would just release the list anyway.  Here it is for you to speculate over.\n\nBuilt-In Commands I would like to use in my game:\n\nHold\nPlay\nRead (Script and Standard)\nTake All and Drop All\nThese are just built-in commands I would like to use in my game.  There are plenty more I would like to see implemented.\n\nOther things I would like to see implemented or changed:\n\n1. A conversation system.  If Alex Warren (the designer of Quest) can write a text parser, I'm sure he can write a basic conversation system.  For someone like Alex, I'm sure it would be easy.  Look at the BASIC program Eliza (Email me @ <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:007bond@aurora-mail.com\">007bond@aurora-mail.com</a><!-- e --> and I'll send you a copy).\n2. Less Windows in QDK: If I want to add a Print Command inside a Then script inside a conditional script in a Global Custom Command, I have to open 7 Windows!  QDK has to be changed so that it doesn't require so many windows, or it needs to be changed to an MDI interface (like ADRIFT)\n3. The standard object type needs to be split into 3 types: The Standard Object, A Living Thing (ie humans, dogs), and modes of transport.\n4. Different room types: Hallways, Halls (Large Rooms), Standard Rooms (Loungeroom), Stairwells (Large ones (in buildings), and Small Ones (In Backyards),  Back and Front Yards, Caves, Forests, Parks, and  Misc. Outside areas.\n5. A built-in spell checker.  Very few people are wiz-bang spellers, and this would help a lot.\n6. Take out the entry for the room you are currently editing in the Compass tab.  This really annoys me, because if I'm not careful, I can end up trapping the player in the one room, and game creators shouldn't have to be careful with a thing like that.\n7. An easy way to review all compass points in the game in QDK, and Quest for debugging purposes (password protected)\n8. A map feature (a definite must).  This helps with the orientation.\n9. Not exactly a high-priority one, but I'm including it just the same: A list of built-in story-lines, and to go with each story-line, is a complete set of starting off rooms and objects, as well as things like status variables like health for fighting games, and time for time-based games (like this one).  To put it simply, in-depth templates.\n10. I thought I'd put this out of curiosity.  If the look at, examine and speak to text boxes are only one-line text-boxes, why do they have the height of three lines?  This can confuse some programmers (including me) by tricking them into pressing enter when they want a new line.  This will then close the dialog box.\n11. A built-in ASL editor with Syntax Highlighting.  This is another definite must, because it will help users learn ASL quicker.\n12. This is one thing I would hate to see happen: A major change in the GUI.  People get used to it, and a major change will generate anger (looking for a better synonym) among the Quest community.\n13. A skinnable interface for the main gameplay screen in Quest.  If skins are too hard, then color schemes.  People soon get sick of the boring grey or black in a program.  Look at WMP.\n14. Maybe I'm being a little picky here, but I thought I should include it anyway: On the standard object Take Tab, the buttone that says \"Edit...\" next to the script box about for when the object is lost by the player is out of line with the other 2 \"Edit...\" buttons.\n15. A password-protected debug mode in Quest.\n16. Invisible status variables.  Some people will argue: \"Thatâ€™s what normal variables are for.\"  Sometimes, it makes it easier to use status variables, and we don't necessarily want it to show up, even if the value is greater then 0.  For example, some authors might want to implement a score system, or an experience system, into their game.  They might decide to use a status variable, it being easier to use ( plus the fact that it has a built-in script for when the value changes), and they won't want it to show up.\n17. Escape codes for percent signs, hash signs, and any other special character that Quest sees as a variable/function.\n18. A lot of the functions in TypeLib are pointless.  If you set the object to an actor, then you cannot have a script run when you talk to someone.  If you set an object as a regular object, then the take script and the when gained by player scripts don't run (and possibly the lost by player script too, I haven't tried).  If you don't set it as a regular object, then it won't let you take it, and therefore the take script and gained by player script don't run anyway.  This has forced me to use custom commands just to be able to take these objects.\n19. There is a problem with the room descriptions.  When you use anything other then standard, it will not display the usual \"You are in:, there is such and such here, you can go there and there.\"  What if the author wants to make a dynamic room description with all that stuff (like I did).\n20. Not essential, but just an idea: room and object dimensions.  This kinda goes with my earlier suggestion, room types.  You wouldn't be able to fit a giant subwoofer in a hallway.  Nor would you have one in a park, for example.\n\nI will be happy to elaborate more on any of these points.  Feel free to discuss, and please keep the myth of me being codingmasters out of it.",

      "HTML": "Before I go on, let me say that this list is about 4 weeks old, and yes, some issues have already been sorted.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite><blockquote><p> A lot of the functions in TypeLib are pointless. If you set the object to an actor, then you cannot have a script run when you talk to someone.</blockquote><br/><br/>Plain and simply wrong on this point. You can have any script you want run when you talk to someone when using typelib (and it isn't even hard to do.) </p></blockquote> <br/><br/>When I said this, I meant that TypeLib only supports single line read actions.  What if you want a script to run when you read something?<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite> If you set an object as a regular object, then the take script and the when gained by player scripts don't run (and possibly the lost by player script too, I haven't tried). </blockquote><br/><br/>OK so the \"take\" script<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> on the regular QDK interface </span>doesn't work if you use typelib - a well known issue and one I have now fixed for the next version (at the time the current typelib was written it wasn't possible to neatly avoid this issue - it is now).  If you don't want the default actions you can easily write your own take action instead which WILL work so I don't understand why this is a 'big problem' - admittedly it isn't as convenient as it might be, but hardly a deal breaker.[/quote]<br/><br/>Agreed, lost/gained scripts only work with the default Quest take/drop/give constructs.  This is mildly annoying but <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">any </span>custom command that moves objects is going to suffer from this problem - until we are given a way to trigger the inbuilt code that deals with these events we have to resort to extra coding to write our own gain/loss handling.<br/><br/>This is one of the issues that has already been sorted out.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite><blockquote><p><br/>If you don't set it as a regular object, then it won't let you take it, and therefore the take script and gained by player script don't run anyway. This has forced me to use custom commands just to be able to take these objects. </blockquote><br/><br/>As I said - nothing I can do about triggering the 'gained by player' script at the moment, but the whole point of typelib is that you use the object types provided, if you want a regular takeable object then that's the type to use.  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: --> <br/><br/>I did have a version of typelib in which you could have some takeable objects that were NOT of any of the provided types - but it was not too successful because people would try to do things with the standard object that was only possible with the provided object types and thus generate error messages which indicated that action wasn't understood at all. By the time I'd error-handled all the commands that wouldn't work for a non typelib object the standard object wasn't 'standard' anymore... <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? --></p></blockquote><br/><br/>This is another issue that has already been sorted out.   <br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite>Conversation system - my latest typelib (not released yet, but mostly working now) has this facility, NPC's can even 'learn' by being told things or reading things.  I personally think this functionality is better added by a library (where we can easily get at it to change things we don't like!) than hard coded into Quest which means we might have to resort to nasty workarounds to get what we want if the 'as provided' code doesn't do exactly what we want.</blockquote><br/><br/>This is something that I would be glad to see and use.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite>3 standard objects? typelib provides a couple of dozen of these already!  It is dead simple to 'tweak' a non human NPC type from the typelib provided \"Actor\"</blockquote><br/><br/>Yes, but the point is that these things really should be built-in to Quest.  It would therefore give MaDbRiT more time to work on other things in his libraries.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite>Modes of transport? Not hard to do either, In the past (Quest 2.1x era I think) I've posted working examples of how to model space shuttles, transporters, magic carpets, motorcycles, magic carpets and elevators - sometimes you need an 'object' to do this, but more often you dont.<br/><br/>Modes of transport break down into two basic categories, things you ride IN (which means - think of a room in Quest) and things you ride ON ( think room and representative dummy object).</blockquote><br/><br/>Yes, well I wasn't around these forums when Quest 2x was around.  I wasn't supposed to know this.  I'm not exactly sure why I put that in to be truthful, now that I think about it.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite>Objects wise I do think furniture (in the sense of bed / chair etc) and the implied ability to sit / lie would be a useful addition.</blockquote><br/><br/>Finally, some support for built-in commands!<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite>Cant see why you'd want different room types at all.  'Room' is just Quest's handle for \"location\" and you can use rooms singly or in multiples to model and sort of location you need.  I did a piece set on a Sailing Ship a while back.  As for room dimensions = use some properties with your rooms (height/width etc) - i.e. this functionality is already available. </blockquote><br/><br/>I said this because Quest could handle the room description better for certain things.  It would also help in the placement of objects; as I said, you wouldn't have a big stereo in a park<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>MaDbRiT wrote:</cite>Spell checker and syntax highlighting editor?

Full screen width captures force the forum to need 1280 x 960 (or greater) screen real estate to avoid horizontal scroll bars in the text or the whole thread and that's as annoying as hell!",

Go read the linked page. Then go sit in a corner and think about what you have posted... Then think about it some more until you realise what you've done!</blockquote><br/><br/>I asked you what exactly I was meant to read, and you never responded!<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>I read 3 lines into it and was annoyed - I'm sure Alex would be more so!</blockquote><br/><br/>I don't see how you can be annoyed.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>1. Built in commands... You can do this by adding an action to the object or using a global command. The only exception maybe \"#action# all\", which maybe should be a universal thing to apply #action# to all the objects in the room (unless \"in inv\" is applied to the end).<br/>Still - easily done yourself - and has different meanings depending on the game.</blockquote><br/><br/>The point I'm trying to make is that it would be a whole lot easier if they were built in.  It means that it would take less time for game developers to write games, and more games would be released!<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>2. (your 1) Conversation system? Like what - you ask questions to someone and they give answers? Just do it yourself as everyone will want then to speak differently.</blockquote><br/><br/>Don't worry about this one.  If you had bothered to read the previous post, you would have seen that Al already has one in the new version of Typelib<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>3. (your 2) Less windows is right. That will take an \"overhaul\" of QDK though - so I wouldn't expect it too soon... Something like he's done with the command screen (putting it into a node-tree window thing) would be ideal IMO.</blockquote><br/><br/>I know.  This would be one to put on Alex's long-term goals for Quest<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>4. Go and read that line again. Then realise why it's sensible to treat all objects the same.</blockquote><br/><br/>Once again, it makes it easier for the developer.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>5. Read this one again too. What's different between a hall and a normal room? - Just the description... Conclusion:: Slap yourself!</blockquote><br/><br/>It makes it easier for the game developer in the orientation of making all the rooms.  For example, a park will have many walkways and many exits, not just eight.  So, a park would have an option to take a certain path off to another place.  If Alex ever implements a map feature, it could make the room look bigger to, like a hallway.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>6. Spell checking is complex... Just load it into word and spell check it quickly.</blockquote><br/><br/>Yeah, but it's still going to go through all the tags, and other scripts.  Somebody needs to write something that will extract the user-inputted text out of an ASL file.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>7. Don't know what you mean here.</blockquote><br/><br/>If you used QDK, you'd know.  On the compass tab in the room editing window, when you are selecting a compass point.  The romm you are editing appears there along with the rest.  Can't you just go through and look for the room name with some Do Until ComboBox.Text = currentRoomName, or whatever, and remove it?<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>8. What?</blockquote><br/><br/>By this I meant that there should be a giant visual map in QDK that lets us look at all the rooms, and create exits and drag and drop rooms into place, etc.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>9. Build / draw your own... You should when you design a game.</blockquote><br/><br/>Once again, it makes it easier for the developer.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Computer Whizz wrote:</cite>10. Right - you mean templates so you type of twats can come in, click one button and go \"OOOO - I've created a game ALL BY MYSELF!\"...

What if the default is green-ish and they wanted to make SURE the colour was black?<br/>Well |cb would just set it to green-ish - the default colour:<br/><blockquote><cite>Help File wrote:</cite>The |cb formatting code traditionally stands for black, but the foreground colour may be changed (by the foreground tag in the game definition block, or by the foreground script command), and so this code now always corresponds to the current foreground colour.</blockquote>This tells us that the foreground is default-ed...<br/><br/>What about |cc (with \"NULL\" passed) to represent the current colour - or |cd as default. Then b would always be black.<br/><br/>I back ITID's colour thought though! (with maybe |cc(00FFFF) instead so it's easier to distinguish colour from comand - like a normal function/whatever.)",

      "HTML": "<blockquote><p>That page is huge. I'm not gonna waste my time reading somthing that I don't need to.</p></blockquote>... My response to that is a bank stare. Obviously you are beyond help of any kind.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>RTFL</p></blockquote>A-huh... And what label is that? I've read loads of labels - the label on you is \"IDIOT\".<br/><br/><blockquote><p>i'm talking about commands like open, close, lock, unlock, climb, etc.</p></blockquote>opening a book is different from opening a door or box - or a person (if you open them with a knife) - same with the others.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>If you know how to read you would not of said what you said in your previous post.</p></blockquote>I've already explained that it's a valid response and just in addition to what they said - infact I explained myself TWICE or more times IIRC - in my original post and in my follow up.... This in fact proves YOU cannot read well along with the fact of your lack of effort.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>You're missing my point. When you add a character, it has special options like speak, give, and other things. An object won't have speak or give, but it might have put in/on.</p></blockquote>I can speak into a microphone, or to a furby, or to anything inanimate - sometimes they can even respond (like a walkie-talkie).<br/>You know this is REALLY easily solved with a \"character\" library addition that you can put together - oh, I'd better correct that - which *I* can put together in a couple of hours tops (yeah - I've been away from programming for a while and I'm not sure exactly how much I would need to put in it). Oh, and you can put stuff on people too.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Yeah, but if you want just compass points, you only get eight, and sometimes this isn't enough.</p></blockquote>You want him to put all 360` into the compass points? 8's traditionally enough, although I'm sure the exit \"ssw\" or \"wsw\" is far beyond you.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>it would save time</p></blockquote>You checking it in word is quicker and easier for everyone involved... Typo's and spelling mistakes aren't uncommon... Beta testers can solve this.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Then you can have a special function that puts a script there, dumbass.</p></blockquote>Why have extra code to go AROUND a problem YOU want there - when you can just NOT click on the current room? This makes extra trouble for the developer - something you're against... Right? So who's contradicting himself?<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Yeah, but it will only have starting things, like health and a starting room, and maybe a character to help you.</p></blockquote>Sounds like a start room and a health system to me.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>You have an attitude problem. Try and be nice for once.</p></blockquote>This is 'being nice'. I'm trying to make you THINK - which is something I shall discontinue with.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>No I don't. I like a challenge in life.</p></blockquote>A-huh. So you NOT doing the BASICS to get a RESULT is 'liking a challenge'... Well I guess I like sky-diving in that case as I've only seen it a couple of times on TV and films.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Well that's what they are called in HTML.</p></blockquote>Fair enough... I know only enough HTML to do what I want. I'm sure I could get into it more but web pages are of ittle interest to me.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Right now I am feeling the urge to call you something really mean.</p></blockquote>Fair enough - if you have a GOOD reason to. I am not one to sink into mindless name-calling, and will only make fun of your responses to do so. My valid point was met by you wanting to call me a name.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I know that RTFM is an acronym. I ain't stupid.</p></blockquote>I'd disagree. If you can acknowledge it's an acronym I'm sure you can google it in 5 seconds (like I did with your RTFL)... Or you could think about it for 3 seconds and come up with the result (maybe thinking of different words beginning with \"m\", to do with the PC, and can help you with dong something is a good start and a BIG hint).<br/><br/><blockquote><p>You need anger management CW.
