      "EditableText": "> I've tried result = \"<5\" and result = <5 and result = greater than 5\r\n\r\nYou're asking if the number `result` is equal to the number `greater than 5`. This fails because \"greater than 5\" isn't a number.\r\nAlthough the expression `result = \"<5\"` would be true if the player literally typed `<5`.\r\n\r\nWhat you want to do is ask if the number `result` is greater than the number `5`. Like this:\r\n```\r\nif (result > 5) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this won't actually work in this case. Because when the player types in a result, it's a sequence of characters, not a number.\r\nIf you're just checking if values are equal, you can do comparisons like `(result = \"5\")`, which checks if the two strings contain all the same characters in the same order. But Quest doesn't support less than or greater than for strings, so you will need to convert the result into a number (in this case an `int`) first.\r\n\r\nFor example, the expression `(ToInt(result) > 5)` converts `result` to an integer, and then compares that integer to `5`.\r\n\r\nBut this brings its own problems. What if the player types \"five\"? `ToInt` will just give an error. So you'd need to start with something like:\r\n<pre><code>if (IsInt (result)) {\r\n  number = ToInt (result)\r\n  <span style=\"font-family:initial\">// all the code to deal with the other numbers</span>\r\n  if (number > 5) {\r\n    <span style=\"font-family:initial\">// whatever you want to do with it</span>\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You need to type in a number.\")\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\nIn this case, you should still be prepared for anything else the player could do. For example, what if they type \"0\", or \"-5\"? For situations like this, using an `else` clause like you posted may be the best solution, because it handles the case where result is greater than 5, the case where result is less than 1, *and* the case where the player types something that isn't a number.\r\n\r\nAlthough I would suggest that the most efficient way of doing this particular code would be using a switch block:\r\n```\r\nTextFX_Typewriter (\"You can move 1,2 3 4 or 5 spaces\", 100)\r\nGetInput() {\r\n  switch (result) {\r\n    case(\"1\") {\r\n      MovePlayer (S89)\r\n    }\r\n    case(\"2\") {\r\n      MovePlayer (S90)\r\n    }\r\n    case(\"3\") {\r\n      MovePlayer (S91)\r\n    }\r\n    case(\"4\") {\r\n      MovePlayer (S92)\r\n    }\r\n    case(\"5\") {\r\n      MovePlayer (S93)\r\n    }\r\n    default {\r\n      msg (\"Please enter 1,2,3,4, or 5\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if the numbers of the pages are all consecutive, you could shorten it like this:\r\n```\r\nTextFX_Typewriter (\"You can move 1,2 3 4 or 5 spaces\", 100)\r\nGetInput() {\r\n  if (IsInt (result)) {\r\n    result = ToInt (result)\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    result = 0\r\n  }\r\n  if (result > 5 or result < 1) {\r\n    msg (\"Please enter 1,2,3,4, or 5\")\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    MovePlayer (GetObject (\"S\" + (88 + result)))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",
