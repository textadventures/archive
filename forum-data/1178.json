It seemed a little vague but as I realized that grammar/spelling errors were minimal and the room/object descriptions were detailed, I continued playing.  The first goal is to get into the house.  Thatâ€™s a little bit of a chore because the author creatively makes you use two items to get in.\nI admit that I â€œcheatedâ€ on that part because I thought I had tried everything and I assumed there was a programming mistake.  There wasnâ€™t.  It turned out to be a creative puzzle.\nIt was neat to see the look and examine definitions being different for each object.  (Currently being generally discussed in a topic in the forums)  Once you look at â€œpicture 1â€, the picture changes to a name that describes the picture such as â€œbeach pictureâ€.  It was just a nice touch.\nI played through the whole thing from start to finish and I have to say that there were a lot of creative touches throughout including the option to write on the post-it notes.\nThe only real error that occurred through the game is if you open a cabinet or examine a particular item where you find another object, it will always revert to the same description.  In other words, letâ€™s say I opened a cabinet (or whatever) and found a pack of gum.  If I take the gum and then open the cabinet again, the gum flies out of the inventory back into the room as if you just found it.  This happens with several objects during the game.\nWithout playing through the game again, I canâ€™t think of any other real â€œbadâ€ things about it.  It wasnâ€™t too long.  In fact it was on the verge of being too short.\nSoâ€¦in conclusion, it was not a perfect game but the playability, the mad puzzles and attention to detail were great so the final score is:\n[b:1zw2l9pi] 4 out of 5[/b:1zw2l9pi]",

Extra special thanks to Steve: The Gaming Guy for the positive review.  This was my first game and I tried to make the mundane chore of exploring a boring house as humorous and stimulating as possible.  There are a lot of boring houses in the world.  Thank you Overcat for pointing me in the right direction for my next game (if I ever get around to making one).  Any advice I can get for making decent games are appreciated.  I'm also very happy that you discovered the magical post-it notes.  You should stand at the front door and attempt to read the house number for the super ultimate Zork reference of all time.",
