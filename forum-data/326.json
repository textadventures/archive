I have read the online help file (I really, really did), yet some things are still a little hard to get.  When/where/how for scripts, for example.  The help guide covers all the objects, properties, variables, etc.  But you have to know what to use, when and how to use it.  That's where the value of tutorials come it.\n\nI downloaded all the sample games, not to play but to learn how to do various things.  But then, you have to first figure out what the author was trying to accomplish before you can see how it was done.\n\nMy wishlist?  A super simple sample (it's Friday) game which has a few locations, a few objects, and a few scripts to show how to interact with the environment.  Stuff that's pretty common to almost any adventure (hide, show, drink)  And, *when* to use a script, variable, flag, etc.  Simple, huh?
