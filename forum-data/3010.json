      "EditableText": "I ask this because I normally will never play a game unless it has been played before and reviewed.  I am not sure if when a game is put up if it has been tested and everything is fine with it.  As in no pop ups start occurring or spy ware or anything else that could be bad for a computer.  I am not sure with it being text if anything can be filtered into a game, but I figured I would ask anyway.  And I am not saying any one would purposely do it, but maybe the person making the game is unaware they themselves have something on their own computer and had by accident, by uploading, sent a virus with it.  Do you guys check every single game and or have an automatic system that does?  I see tons of games with no reviews and that makes me think they were never played and or tested.\n\n  Also what does &quot;Sandlot&quot; games mean?  There are tons of games in that category.  Thanks.",
