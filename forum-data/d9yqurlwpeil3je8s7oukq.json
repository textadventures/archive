      "EditableText": "I've been mulling over a simple way to allow players to turn off audio.\r\n\r\nThis has only been tested in my head, but the one I came up with is to set a command in **game** for **sound off** and have it run a script which just sets any audio you have in your game to off. As long as you don't have a massive list of audio files this wouldn't be too much of a pain to set up.\r\n\r\nThis, however, relies on the player reading your game info so that they're aware such a command exists, and it also creates a potential hiccup in which any room that triggers sound will result in said sound starting up again every time the player revisits that room.\r\n\r\nA fix for this would be to set a flag in the **sound off** command, and then check for that flag in the room where the sound is triggered. If they have the flag (meaning they've turned sound off) don't play it, otherwise do play it.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

      "EditableText": "In game, I think it would be difficult but I think you would need to place IF scripts whenever you play a sound.  If the player chooses to mute sound by typing 'turn off sound' or the like, you could set a flag.  Then whenever a sound might trigger, just check for that flag in an IF script.  That would work, right?  My game had tons of sounds but no so many that it would be a pain in the ass to throw IFs in front of them.\r\n\r\nAlso, you could just suggest they mute that Internet tab?\r\n\r\nEDIT:  lol.  Did I just not read that last bit or did you edit it when I typed my response??  Ha.  I'm getting so old!",
