There's a lot of really cool string/msg manipulation and etc stuff you can do, if you got stuff in the game (or whateve the program you're making) that requires it.

There's a huge world of coding involved with string/msg manipulation, lots of really cool stuff that can be done! So, while the text process commands are nice when they're all you need (and when/what they can be used for or able to used, lol), you really should though also start to learn and get some practice into using the normal scripting with/for your msg scripts too, learning some of the cool and neat things that you can with them/it. Just concatenation, in it's simpliest form, enables you to do really neat/cool stuff, such as 'building up' a message based upon conditions being met or not.",
