      "EditableText": "I think most people would use the expression `box.parent` - which refers to the room or object containing `box`. That will work as long as the box isn't inside another box.\r\n\r\n<code>FilterByAttribute <b>(</b>ListParents (box), “isroom”, true)<b>)</b></code> is a slightly more robust expression. It goes through all the objects that `box` is inside, and gets a list of all the ones that are rooms. However, that's a *list* of rooms, not a room, so I suspect that it won't work if you pass it to `MoveObject`.\r\n\r\nI think that you could probably use something like <code style=\"color: green\">ListItem (FilterByAttribute (</b>ListParents (box), “isroom”, true))<b>, 0)</b></code> to get the first object on that list, which will be the outermost room the box is in.\r\n\r\nIf there's a possibility that the box is inside a room inside a room and you want to move the player to the inner one, you'd want a slightly more complex script. This goes over the objects the box is inside, closest first, until it finds one that is a room.\r\n\r\n```\r\nroom = box\r\nwhile (not GetBoolean (room, \"isroom\") and HasObject (room, \"parent\")) {\r\n  room = room.parent\r\n}\r\nMoveObject (gamme.pov, room)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that's clear enough. Alternatively, you could just use the expression `box.parent` - as long as you're sure the box won't be inside a non-room container.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\nHope that all makes sense. And for future reference, the character counting for error messages is a bit wonky. In order to say what's wrong with a particular line of code, it will help a lot if you can quote the actual error. You can put it code and error messages between a pair of backticks (`) so that the  forum doesn't  try to add weird formatting.",
