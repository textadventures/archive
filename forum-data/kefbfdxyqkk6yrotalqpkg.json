      "EditableText": "Hello Folks! \r\nSo this is my first time using Squiffy and I have somewhat gotten the hang of it(no, not at all actually). I have most of the base code down and all of my story content written out and currently assembling! Pretty exciting stuff(in my own mind anyway)! However I have two main problems and I think they can both be solved with same set of code or similar. \r\n\r\nProblem 1: \r\nLets say during Chapter 1 of the story you have the option of picking up an item. Fast forward to Chapter 6. Is it possible to make a two different passages based on if you picked up the item or not? \r\nExample: \r\nPassage 1: The wall seems to have a circular indent. You see nothing else of interest. (Go back)  \r\nPassage 2: The wall seems to have a circular indent. It looks a lot like..... You use the silver talisman and the wall slides open to reveal a hidden passage(Silver Talisman used)\r\n\r\nThat would pretty much solve all my problems honestly. It's the last piece of code I really need to pull the whole thing together. Currently I am using a master section([[]]:) and @set to make attributes and stuff. This last bit is super frustrating! Any help would greatly be appreciated. \r\n\r\nProblem 2 kind of ties into problem 1. \r\nI want to have certain passages/dialouge available if the MC has a good enough relationship with a certain NPC. \r\nExample: \r\n\"Do you want to go on a adventure with me?\" \r\nPassage 1:  \"Sure, we totally smashed those goblins last time.\" \r\nPassage 2: \"Sorry, I don't really know you well enough for that.\"(Reputation too low) \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? I hope it does and I really hope someone can help me out. Much appreciated! If their is a thread like this already, sorry! Please link it to me. Thanks!",
