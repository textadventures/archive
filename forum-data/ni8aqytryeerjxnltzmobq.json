      "EditableText": "Hey,\r\nI just wanted to know if there was a way to wait for a particular period of time (in a gamebook). Currently the only option is to either wait until a key is pressed. The workaround I have found is to insert a blank sound file lasting how long I want to wait for, and restrict continuance until it has finished. However, this makes playing background music whilst progressing impossible. \r\n\r\nI want to print something, then have a wait of two seconds, then print something else.\r\n\r\nI've got literally no coding knowledge so if someone could break it down for me I'd be very appreciative. Thanks!",
