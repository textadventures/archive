The items could be found in any order. I thought I could maybe define a variable kit=0 at the start of the game (? Where?) then put kit=kit+1 each time an item is found and worn, with if kit=5 print message each time. But I can’t find where to put these commands or how to word the instruction.  Can anyone help please?",
