Like: \n\n&gt; TALK TO DEMON (Level 2)\n'Hi, can I help you with...whatever?'\n&gt; You cannot interact with a opponent of that level yet. Collect all required gems/gold/etc. in order to proceed to level 2 and go to sleep in room X.\n\n&gt; TALK TO IMP (Level 1)\n'Hi, can I help you with...whatever?'\n'Sure, I'd need help with...whatever.'\n&gt; HELP IMP\nGrateful for your help, the imp drops you a gem. You have 29 more gems to collect today. \n\nOnce the player has approached enough Level 1 creatures and collected enough gems, he/she can go to sleep and start the next day at level 2 and from then on can approach both level 1 + 2 monsters and so on. \n\nA combat system would be nice but is not that necessary; the counting thingy would be way more important for my plans. Furthermore, an option for e. g. drinking potions that permanently change the players looks would be awesome like 'The potions you just used gave you wings.' So, when the player finds another potion, it would be great if the game could remember that the player already has wings. \n\nIs anything of this possible?

Also, unfortunately unless you know coding decently, generalized help isn't of much help either, as you don't know how to take it's concept/example, and adjust it to whatever you need.\n\n-----\n\nI'd really suggest trying to go through most of the original tutorial (on the docs site), and if you need help with any parts of it, ask/get help on it. Get done the original tutorial well, as it's the basics of using quest and slightly gets into the vital concepts of scripting and attributes.\n\nAlso, ask a lot of questions, as this can help you understand quest and all of the terms and concepts better, which will help you out a lot, as you start to understand quest's structure, and maybe even into its coding and its coding structure. The quicker you can get an understanding all of the terms and etc helps out a lot, as I can attest to (look at my 'help me noob HK' thread ... once I started to understand all of the terms and concepts a lot better, I was a lot less overwhelmed, and was able to learn faster)\n\nAlso, read as many guides and etc/posts/threads as you can too:\n\n1. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/</a><!-- m --> (guides)\n2. <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=18\">viewforum.php?f=18</a><!-- l --> (more guides: libraries and code samples forum-board)\n3. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/</a><!-- m --> (examining/exploring/navigating the doc helps a lot too... click on the stuff at the top of the page: scripts ~ functions ~ types ~ elements, and drill down into them)\n\nnext, do XanMag's 'tutorial and templates' tutorial game, as he too was frustrated that there's still a huge jump from the original tutorial into actually making your own game on your own, and thus he created this &quot;game&quot;, as that bridge from the original tutorial to doing stuff on your own, for your own game making\n\nafter that, then it's learning how to do the scripting (mainly the 'if' Script) and Attributes, as these two things are the basics of game making, especially when used together, lets you do 90% of everything you want to do in/for your game.\n\nthen... you slowly move on to learning more advanced stuff and also becoming familair with all of quest's built-in stuff (studying/using the doc site).\n\nneedless to say, none of this is easy, you must be patient and dedicated, taking small step by small step, every time you're successful with learning something new, and/or getting something to work right/figured out, is a huge achievement. Slowly those small successes start to build up, and you start becoming more knowledgeable and capable game maker.\n\n-----\n\nunfortunately, this is the same for any game making, there's a learning curve no matter what software/engine is provided to you, and quest is one of the best. Quest let's you get into game making the fastest and easiest, but it's still not easy nor fast.\n\nIt's taken me 4 years to get at where I'm at now, and thanks to quest, I'm now taking programming classes as my hopeful major/career in being a programmer, and am doing pretty well, I am amazed at how much quest (and its community here: users/mods, Pixie and Jay are workaholics when it comes to helping out and/or providing more libraries and code samples for quest, and Pertex too, can really help out) has helped me with learning to code/program, hehe.\n\n-----\n\nP.S.\n\nif you ever get interested in learning to code with quest, I'd love to help you out, as it's not as scary as it seems, and it makes game making so much easier and faster too. Though, coding isn't for everyone (well it can be, again it's not as scary as it seems, meh), and quest has an excellent GUI~Editor for non-coders, but you got to learn it, and the concepts and 'if' logic mentality/mindset required of game making.",

The quicker you can get an understanding all of the terms and etc helps out a lot, as I can attest to (look at my 'help me noob HK' thread ... once I started to understand all of the terms and concepts a lot better, I was a lot less overwhelmed, and was able to learn faster)<br/><br/>Also, read as many guides and etc/posts/threads as you can too:<br/><br/>1. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/</a><!-- m --> (guides)<br/>2. <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=18\">viewforum.php?f=18</a><!-- l --> (more guides: libraries and code samples forum-board)<br/>3. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/</a><!-- m --> (examining/exploring/navigating the doc helps a lot too... click on the stuff at the top of the page: scripts ~ functions ~ types ~ elements, and drill down into them)<br/><br/>next, do XanMag's 'tutorial and templates' tutorial game, as he too was frustrated that there's still a huge jump from the original tutorial into actually making your own game on your own, and thus he created this &quot;game&quot;, as that bridge from the original tutorial to doing stuff on your own, for your own game making<br/><br/>after that, then it's learning how to do the scripting (mainly the 'if' Script) and Attributes, as these two things are the basics of game making, especially when used together, lets you do 90% of everything you want to do in/for your game.<br/><br/>then... you slowly move on to learning more advanced stuff and also becoming familair with all of quest's built-in stuff (studying/using the doc site).<br/><br/>needless to say, none of this is easy, you must be patient and dedicated, taking small step by small step, every time you're successful with learning something new, and/or getting something to work right/figured out, is a huge achievement. Slowly those small successes start to build up, and you start becoming more knowledgeable and capable game maker.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>unfortunately, this is the same for any game making, there's a learning curve no matter what software/engine is provided to you, and quest is one of the best. Quest let's you get into game making the fastest and easiest, but it's still not easy nor fast.<br/><br/>It's taken me 4 years to get at where I'm at now, and thanks to quest, I'm now taking programming classes as my hopeful major/career in being a programmer, and am doing pretty well, I am amazed at how much quest (and its community here: users/mods, Pixie and Jay are workaholics when it comes to helping out and/or providing more libraries and code samples for quest, and Pertex too, can really help out) has helped me with learning to code/program, hehe.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>if you ever get interested in learning to code with quest, I'd love to help you out, as it's not as scary as it seems, and it makes game making so much easier and faster too. Though, coding isn't for everyone (well it can be, again it's not as scary as it seems, meh), and quest has an excellent GUI~Editor for non-coders, but you got to learn it, and the concepts and 'if' logic mentality/mindset required of game making.",
