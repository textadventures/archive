As an amateur (but proficient) author, I have a tendency to write long-winded, descriptive paragraphs about locations.  Now I'm realizing there is an art to converting story to game, and there just comes a point when you have to back off of the descriptions.  I am more inexperienced as a programmer than a story-teller, so I thought I would bring it up for discussion.  Has anyone else struggled with this problem?  \n\nI'm kind of curious about others' opinions on this and some solutions.  Some of the most enjoyable text games from the 80s seem to have the simple/difficult ratios mastered, and that's why they're so fun!  Your thoughts?",
