For example, in my game, if you read a specific note, I set the note's &quot;read&quot; flag to true.  Then, later in the game, I can check this flag and print a message depending on if the note was read.\n\nHowever, I haven't been so successful with attributes.  I'd like to create an attribute for an object... let's say the attribute is &quot;status&quot;.  Then, I want to set the attribute to a string value - for example, &quot;waiting&quot;.  The I want to check to see if that object's status attribute is set to waiting.\n\nBut I can't figure out how to do this.  I'm using the Quest interface.  I've tried this way:\n\nFor setting the status when the player enters a room:\n---\nAfter entering the room for the first time:\nSet variable [bob.status] = [expression] [&quot;waiting&quot;]\n---\n\nPrinting something out when the status is set to waiting:\n---\nif: [object attribute equals] Object [object] [bob] Attribute [status] = [&quot;waiting&quot;]\nThen... (print something out)\n---\n\nI know this isn't correct.  I'm pretty confused!\n\nAny help would be much appreciated,\n\nThanks,\n- Bret",
