Moss now has a 'taken' flag so it cannot be taken again.  Moss should remain there at the lake on the rocks even after the player has taken some of it.  It'd be idiotic to think the player removes all the moss from the rocks, right?  Moss1 has a different description than moss.  Moss is on the rock, moss1 has been removed from the rock.  Something must be done to the moss1 to make it usable in a 'puzzle', but it's still moss.  When that something is done, I remove moss1 from the game and introduce moss2.  \r\n\r\nAll of that works just fine.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that because moss and moss1 have the same name (and they should), if I 'x moss' in the room where moss and moss1 are at the same time, I get that stupid message asking which moss do I want to look at, moss or moss.\r\n\r\nIs there an easier work around for this?  The easiest is probably to rename moss1 to something like 'Sphagnum'.  Xanadu IS/WAS a science teacher after all and once he takes the moss from the rock, I could print a message like \"You scrape some moss off the rock and examine it.  HEY!  You recognize this as Sphagnum moss!\"  But, I'm not sure I want to do that.  Or should I?  Does it add character or is it just pedantic?  I don't know.  I'm tired.  \r\n\r\nThanks one more time!",
