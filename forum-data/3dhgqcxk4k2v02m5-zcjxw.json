I'm working on a game in my browser (I have a Chromebook which can't run exe files) and I was wondering if the desktop program can open games I made with the browser version. Another question: what file format does the desktop program export as? Is it exe? I can't find out for myself because I don't have a Windows computer available at the moment. If it doesn't export to exe, can i convert it? I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid questions. Thanks in advance.",
