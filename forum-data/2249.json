That is to say, make them say different things. So, say for instance the player typed &quot;Talk to Dave&quot; and it displayed the message.. &quot;I've been waiting for you, where have you been?&quot; How could I make it so the player can type where ever they've been, and get it to print a message with Dave responding with something like... &quot;While you've been at (name of place) Seth has been destroying the town!&quot; If anyone can help I'd be most grateful!",
