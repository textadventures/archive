But I want it to be able to crush multiple eggs at a time. So instead of making 10 different egg objects, I create 1 egg object and stick it in a DebugRoom room. Then I make 10 clones of the egg and move them to the Crusher room. I give it the attribute Crushed and set to false.\r\n\r\nSo the input is given and the Crusher room 'crushes'.
