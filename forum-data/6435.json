      "EditableText": "The game description gets used on the Text Adventurers web site, not in the game. If you look on the web site, click on any game. The image (if it has one) is to the left, this is the cover image. The description is on the right, with the &quot;Play now&quot; button underneath. Neither the cover nor the description are used in your game (and they are only used when you first upload your game; if you update it and upload again, the cover and description will not be changed).\n\nTo do what you want, go to the Scripts tab of the game object, and look at the Start script area at the top. Add a new script, Print a message, and put the text in there (best to have a new Print for each paragraph).",
