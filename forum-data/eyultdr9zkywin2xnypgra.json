I've been a lurker for quite a while and have played quite a few of the text adventures on this site and I am really impressed with the games and I am willing to make some myself. I've just registered so I thought I'd introduce myself.\r\n\r\nMy earliest memory of a text adventure game was The Lord of the Rings for the BBC Micro. It was a cherished memory of sitting around with my family trying to solve this game. Then by the early 90s the Commodore Amiga 500 plus was released and although we had lots of games to try out when we first got the computer for Christmas, I ignored most of them in favour of a text adventure game called Dungeon Quest (anyone remember that one?). I was hooked by it because it was quite atmospheric due to the good art and great sound effects at the time and also text adventures fuelled the imagination. Another text game we had later we used to drive me insane and never completed it was Suspicious Cargo. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I am filled to the brim with ideas and would like to commit them in the form of text adventures. Already I have made a start on writing on notebooks to work out what I want. I will learn more about making games and will give you all a shout if I need any advice.\r\n\r\nThanks for this awesome website. Keep it up and hopefully I'll get around to posting in games of my own!",
