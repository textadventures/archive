You need to actually do something with that returned-selected number...\r\n\r\nwhich gets us to (usually using) Lists, as the items in a list have asssociated number values (their 'index numbers', starting from the left if in coding or from the GUI/Editor the first item you add to a list, as index number 0 item, index number 1 item, index number 2 item, etc etc etc). Now, that randomly selected number from 'GetRandomInt', is doing something, via using a list to get the item associated with that same number value via that list item's index number. To get and return an item from a list using the index number, you use the: generalized/universal 'ListItem', or the specific Attribute type ones: 'StringListItem' or 'ObjectListItem', Functions\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<game name=\"example_game\">\r\n  <attr name=\"color_stringlist_attribute\" type=\"simplestringlist\">red;blue;yellow</attr> // Red (index number: 0), blue (index number: 1), and yellow (index number:2)\r\n  <attr name=\"start\" type=\"script\">\r\n    randomly_selected_color_string_variable = StringListItem (game.color_stringlist_attribute, GetRandomInt (0,2))\r\n    msg (randomly_selected_color_string_variable)\r\n  </attr>\r\n</game>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nyou only have to use '0' as the min range value for your 'GetRandomInt' Function's Parameter (input), due to List Attributes starting at index number 0. Though, if you don't like using zero, you can always do this:\r\n\r\n'GetRandomInt (1,100) - 1' is the same as doing 'GetRandomInt (0,99)' // you CAN do this for getting a List's item\r\n~or, the opposite/reverse~\r\n'GetRandomInt (0,99) + 1' is the same as doing 'GetRandomInt (1,100)' // but you can't do/use this for getting a List's item !!!!!\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nalso, for your max range value, when working with using the 'GetRandomInt' with Lists, is to use the 'ListCount(NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_LIST_ATTRIBUTE) -1', as your various lists will have differing quantity of items as well as individual lists having their quantity of items being changed (you add/remove item to/from the list during game play). Using the 'ListCount(LIST) -1' will handle this all for you:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrandomly_selected_string_variable = StringListItem (NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_LIST_ATTRBIUTE, GetRandomInt (0, ListCount (NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_LIST_ATTRBIUTE) - 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nand here's a more detailed guide/explanation on using Lists/Dictionaries:\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5137/list-and-dictionary-extensive-guide-by-hk\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nas, already been explained by Tin:\r\n\r\nan 'integer/int' in math/programming, is a number that is not a decimal number: ..., -3289798323, -5, 0, 3, 28902903, ...\r\n\r\na 'decimal/fractional number (or whatever the fancy name for it, is in math, lol-meh)/double/float/floating-point' in math/programming, is: ..., -353.9999, -1.123, 0.0, 2.93, 2839283902.4, ....\r\n\r\na 'whole number (if I remember right, too lazy to look up)' in math is: positive numbers (this EX-cludes zero): 1, 2, 3, 4, 32392382938293, ...\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nin programming, working with decimal numbers takes much more work than working with integers (if you can, it's better to not use decimal numbers), due to how computers/programming works...\r\n\r\n(two seperate operations: one to find the integer value to the left of the decimal, the other to find the decimal value to the right of the decimal, along with usually having to shift the bits, and replace the decimal into the correct spot to separate the integer values from the decimal/fractional values for the answer/returning/new decimal number to you. Decimals are jsut so much more messy to work with in computers/programming, as computers are dumb, whereas humans can easily and quickly do what is much slower/harder for computers to do, making it easy and quick for our brains to handle decimal numbers, whereas it's harder for the computer to do so, and thus harder for you if you got to do the coding in of it, and also thus due to having to do more work, means that the performance/speed is slower: a computer having to do more work means longer wating time for you than the computer having to do less work. ie \"efficiency\" handling. General-simple operations, due to our modern computers, generally the increased work/time is unnoticeable, but for critical systems, limited memory/space, and/or complex programs doing trillions of operations, doing more work than needed: inefficiency, can become extremely noticeable... the computer seems to freeze/not do anything... you're waiting on the computer to complete the action for a long long long long time).\r\n\r\nAnd then there's all the programming of the various types of rounding handling... as there's finite resources, a computer/calculator will run out of memory/space in trying to return pi, so there's a rounding cut-off/termination required, as well as people wanting the various types of rounding handling (round up/ceiling, round down/flooring, truncation, etc, etc).\r\n\r\nVery very very messy...
