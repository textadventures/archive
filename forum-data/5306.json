In this room there will also be an as-simple-as-possible walkthrough describing step-by-step how it was done (with screenshots from the GUI).

All I have currently are the room names, universal help commands, and the introductory room completed.\n\nMy questions are this... \n1.  Will it be worth it (with regards to my time invested and new Quest user usage)?  I know it would be worth it personally, because it will help me code better and give me my own personal library to refer to.\n2.

That's why I haven't really fired it up yet.  Also, like I said at the beginning... I'm not even sure if something out there already exists.\n\nThe hard part I think for me would be to make it game-like instead of a tutorial.

Though maybe if you can guide me with what you need help with, code bit by code bit, maybe I could be of better help for you.<br/><br/>if you haven't yet looked at the latest posts in this thread (where I'm trying to help neon learn to code), here is the link:<br/><br/><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=5273&amp;p=36720#p36711\">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=5273&amp;p=36720#p36711</a><!-- l --><br/><br/>(though this is a bit further into understanding code, as neonayon has already learned the more basic stuff then this, so this may be too far ahead in learning to code for you)</blockquote><br/><br/>Thanks mate, I appreciate the help and I am trying to learn.<br/><br/>I tired using gamemaker but I left it since the tutorials don't help since they are to old for the new versions that are out, The code keeps changing and it gets really frustrating. With Quest, it's really simple to understand, even though a lot has been left out of the Quest tutorials. Though there will come a point when I will push myself to learning code here.",
