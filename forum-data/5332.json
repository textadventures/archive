Sorry!  <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? --> \n\nIn my game I have four keys hanging on a peg board.  The number of keys match the number of vehicles they can be used on.  All four vehicles are essentially identical, thus so are the keys.  When you look at the peg board with the keys on it, it says &quot;It contains unknown key 1, unknown key 2, unknown key 3, and unknown key 4.&quot;  For obvious reasons, I'd rather it not read this way, but I still want to have four keys instead of resorting to swapping out an object called 'four keys', 'three keys', and 'two keys'.  If there is more than one key on the peg board, is there a way I can make it read &quot;If contains 4 similar keys&quot; or &quot;It contains 3 similar keys&quot; or &quot;It contains 2 similar keys&quot;?  \n\nIs there a VERY easy way to do this?  If not, no big deal, especially if I have to dork around with code.  It's more of a cosmetic thing.  Thanks again!",
