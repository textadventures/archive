Seems easy enough requiring another object when using custom verbs, though Take doesn't give you that option, and to create a custom verb of Take clashes with the default Inventory command. It would need the user to type 'Take ice cube with tongs' rather that 'use tongs with ice cube'. I'm sure there must be a simple way I'm missing.\n\nThanks in advance!",
