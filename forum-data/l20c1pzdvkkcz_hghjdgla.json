I enjoy the challenge of expanding my knowledge of tricks that can be used in Squiffy coding). I would like to become more involved with Textadventures. As I have said in some spots in the forum, I think Squiffy is an incredible learning tool and am planning on having my students again create text based games based on the literature we read (Haven't done that since 2019 with students actually using Squiffy.) As an English teacher, I think I would have a tremendous understanding of the language necessary for a text based game, and as a teacher who has assisted students on many occasions with Squiffy coding in class, assisting with such coding has become like second nature. In addition, as someone who has created numerous Squiffy games, I feel I have a strong knowledge base of what makes choices challenging. I would really enjoy assisting game makers out with advice and with tricks that I've picked up along the way with coding.\r\n\r\nReally believe in Textadventures and truly want to help it reach the enormous potential that I know it has.",
