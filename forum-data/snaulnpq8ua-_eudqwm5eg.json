I'd be surprised if the editor was ready before the end of this year.  The Pixie is the sole developer.  Also, the maintainer of this site is currently handing everything over to The Pixie, and Pixie will likely be focused on site-related things for a month or few once the transition is complete.\r\n<br/>Honestly, I was just thinking about asking Pixie when he thought the editor might be ready.  I was discussing this with another forumer just this morning. I assume it will be a few months, but The Pixie usually knows stuff that I don't know.  :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n2. I think I know what you mean by hotspots...  Basically, anything you can do with JS or CSS or HTML, you will be able to do in Quest 6, as long as you know how to code it.  It sounds like you want to make it so clicking a certain area inside of an image will send a command to the parser, and I'm certain this can be done, but I doubt it will be built-in by default -- meaning you would have to code it yourself. (If you don't know how to code it, I'd bet that someone on this forum would be more than happy to help out.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n3. Sort of.  It will work just like Quest does right now, which is sort of the opposite of that.  You click on the object and a list of verbs appears.  You could add a verb block, but, again, you would have to code it yourself.  And, again, the forum is here to help if you don't know how to code something.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> I was going to give you some context as to why I'm asking these particular questions, but I quickly realized I was wedging several conversations into one post. \r\n\r\nHeck, I do that all the time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> So, instead I'm going to spam the forum with three separate topics.\r\n> Is this when you say, \"sorry, not sorry?\"\r\n\r\n[ MANIACAL LAUGH ]",

      "EditableText": "It's times like this I wish I knew more about programming, so I could help out. I realize it's mostly Pixie doing it all at this point with little help. Thanks for continuing the legacy of Quest! When I first wanted to make a text adventure a few years ago, I shopped around quite a bit, and nothing else was satisfying. \r\n\r\nFrankly, it's kind of pathetic I'm not fluent in anything at this point. I read \"C++ For Dummies\" about 12 years ago, plus a couple of other books on C# and game design. I've used C#, html, JavaScript, Python (and Ruby2/3), and CSS, but always for very small projects or with assistance from a GUI editor. I made a Quest game and built an iFrame for it to put it on Kongregate, I've done little patches for people, and I made some neat stuff happen in RPGMXP. Yet, I still can't say I really know any language confidently. I'm always looking things up on W3Schools or suffering trial and error.\r\n\r\nFor some reason JavaScript intimidates me. I don't know if it's the look of it or what. However, I have ideas I want to play with, and I find myself disinclined to go back to Quest 5, so... I'm gonna try to learn more about JavaScript. It'll be good for me, lol.\r\n\r\nFor the graphics and hotspots, I was really just curious. I can hardly draw a stick figure to save my life. Creative writing is my thing, so, yay, text adventures! In principle, it would work the same with hyperlinks anyway.\r\n\r\nIf I manage to learn enough, I may offer to help out (it would be kind of a thrill for me, if I could). In the meantime, I imagine testing the editor requires actually making games in it, which would be a time consuming process, and potentially hard to find volunteers for. When you're ready, let me know, and I'd happy to spend some time on testing.\r\n\r\nAlso, and I'm just thinking out loud here, the servers on this site seem a bit under-powered. If some philanthropic minded passer-by wanted to help fix that, roughly how much money would be needed to make a noticeable improvement?",
