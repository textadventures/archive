The destruction of the American dream started in the early 1660s with the start of the Civil War. \r\n\r\nThis 4 hour documentary by Bill Still gets you into the history of our current banking regime, who the bankers were, and it isn't very hard to do some research into who started stuff like Zionism.  The Chabad Lubavitch are a bit harder to track down. \r\nhttps://youtu.be/WVxWPkMXOmw\r\n\r\nBenjamin Freeman exposes what really happened with WWI and WWII, and what our current system is based on.\r\nhttps://archive.org/details/UsIllegallyEnteringIntoWw1AndDefeatingGermanyIllegally\r\n\r\nThis is actually what the focus of my text adventure is on, why I am using a cellphone as a game object to allow the player to navigate through snippets of videos and files and images that trace the 13000 years of human history I have mapped. \r\n\r\nAs a teaser, solar flares hit the planet, the dating has been essentially confirmed to 13000 years ago. Anthony Peratt was working at Los Alamos labs for the US Department of Energy on experiments to replace nuclear reactors with Plasma reactors. What he found blew a hole right through everyone's notions of world history.  What he found was that the plasma discharge morphology created in his experiments was not only consistent every time, but variations on the exact same patterns was carved on rocks on every continent we have access to.  So far at least 139 countries. \r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/6meaU1QcSdA\r\n\r\nhttp://mythopedia.info/books.html\r\nMarinus Anthony van der Sluijs\r\n\r\nTraditional Cosmology: The Global Mythology of Cosmic Creation and Destruction\r\n(London: All-Round Publications, 2011; 2018)\r\n\r\nThis work, in 6 volumes, is a compendium of traditional cosmologies worldwide. The material includes the global mythology of creation and destruction, but also comprises information drawn from other areas of traditional knowledge, ritual, iconography, shamanism, costume, and dance. Relying on original sources, universal points of agreement are identified, often on counter-intuitive ideas. These suggest a single template, a blueprint for a universal mythology of origins with local variations.\r\n\r\nhttps://archive.org/details/vanderSluijs-SIS-REVIEW-2016-2-3-2017\r\nHis primary paper discussing his work.  425 categories of agreement between all global myths and Peratt's experiments and the rock art.  This is the origins of global tree of life and creation mythology, what caused the floods and fires in myths, and what inspired stories of battling gods. \r\n\r\nCheers.  \r\n\r\nP.S. The computer stuff, well, Bill Gates recently admitted that Israel  wrote most of the code for Windows 10...\r\nIsrael has given control of its major ports to China and is moving its technology sector into China to use its capacity to mass produce all kinds of interesting and dangerous technology.

These are all American legal actions that give the Chabad Lubavitch power to create special Talmudic Courts of Justice in every city in America, and then Globally.

The destruction of the American dream started in the early 1660s with the start of the Civil War.</p>\n<p>This 4 hour documentary by Bill Still gets you into the history of our current banking regime, who the bankers were, and it isn't very hard to do some research into who started stuff like Zionism.  The Chabad Lubavitch are a bit harder to track down.<br>\nhttps://youtu.be/WVxWPkMXOmw</p>\n<p>Benjamin Freeman exposes what really happened with WWI and WWII, and what our current system is based on.<br>\nhttps://archive.org/details/UsIllegallyEnteringIntoWw1AndDefeatingGermanyIllegally</p>\n<p>This is actually what the focus of my text adventure is on, why I am using a cellphone as a game object to allow the player to navigate through snippets of videos and files and images that trace the 13000 years of human history I have mapped.</p>\n<p>As a teaser, solar flares hit the planet, the dating has been essentially confirmed to 13000 years ago. Anthony Peratt was working at Los Alamos labs for the US Department of Energy on experiments to replace nuclear reactors with Plasma reactors. What he found blew a hole right through everyone's notions of world history.  What he found was that the plasma discharge morphology created in his experiments was not only consistent every time, but variations on the exact same patterns was carved on rocks on every continent we have access to.  So far at least 139 countries.</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/6meaU1QcSdA</p>\n<p>http://mythopedia.info/books.html<br>\nMarinus Anthony van der Sluijs</p>\n<p>Traditional Cosmology: The Global Mythology of Cosmic Creation and Destruction<br>\n(London: All-Round Publications, 2011; 2018)</p>\n<p>This work, in 6 volumes, is a compendium of traditional cosmologies worldwide. The material includes the global mythology of creation and destruction, but also comprises information drawn from other areas of traditional knowledge, ritual, iconography, shamanism, costume, and dance. Relying on original sources, universal points of agreement are identified, often on counter-intuitive ideas. These suggest a single template, a blueprint for a universal mythology of origins with local variations.</p>\n<p>https://archive.org/details/vanderSluijs-SIS-REVIEW-2016-2-3-2017<br>\nHis primary paper discussing his work.  425 categories of agreement between all global myths and Peratt's experiments and the rock art.  This is the origins of global tree of life and creation mythology, what caused the floods and fires in myths, and what inspired stories of battling gods.</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n<p>P.S. The computer stuff, well, Bill Gates recently admitted that Israel  wrote most of the code for Windows 10...<br>\nIsrael has given control of its major ports to China and is moving its technology sector into China to use its capacity to mass produce all kinds of interesting and dangerous technology.  Check out Brendon O'Connell on YouTube.</p>\n<p>#AlJazeera undercover investigation into the Israel Lobby in America.

These are all American legal actions that give the Chabad Lubavitch power to create special Talmudic Courts of Justice in every city in America, and then Globally.  I promise you, they are going to be like Gulags.</p>\n<p>For more reference, or in case you can't get to the website listed above,<br>\nhttps://goyimgazette.com/truth-talmud/<br>\nThere is a section pretty far down that talks about the US Government and Talmudic Courts</p>\n<p>And a final gift for everyone, Yuri Bezmenov, KGB Defector explains how nations are infiltrated and destabilized and their cultures manipulated.<br>\nhttps://youtu.be/5gnpCqsXE8g</p>\n<p>I figured a choose your own adventure game that walked people through this in jumps and such and let them figure out how to navigate it would be fun.</p>\n<p>Anyone that wants to help, I am always game for more coding help.</p>\n<p>And perhaps a team with enough experience can get together to rebuild the engine from scratch in small teams of 1 or 2.
