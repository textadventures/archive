      "EditableText": "Making a status attribute that changes when some other value changes is a common request. The most common ways to do it are using a _changescript_ (which runs whenever a certain value changes), or a _turnscript_ (which runs every turn).\r\n\r\nIn this case, I suspect that the turnscript option would be easier. You can create turnscripts at the bottom of the game's \"Scripts\" tab.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the only coding needed is the mathematical formula you want to use. You can just enter the calculation as an expression. I don't know what stats you're using, but as an example I'll assume your player is going to have a _success_ status attribute that is the average of their _fame_, _influence_, and _reputation_. You should be able to adapt this to your stats easily enough.\r\n\r\nthe script for the turnscript in this case would be:\r\n```\r\nplayer.success = (player.fame + player.influence + player.reputation) / 3\r\n```\r\nor as it appears in the GUI view:\r\n<img src=\"https://bolshevik.mrangel.info/Quest_success.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the code above in GUI view\"/>\r\n(you can't see the whole expression there because it's cut off by the edge of the box, but I'm sure you know what it means)\r\n\r\nYou can make the arithmetic as complex as you want, in an \"Expression\" box.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't clear enough, please let me know what you're having trouble with :) I'd be happy to help",
