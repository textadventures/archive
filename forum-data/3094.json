I would like for the player to simply be able to type &quot;show health&quot; or &quot;health&quot; and have the game display the remaining health. I have created a player attribute called &quot;Health&quot; (with an integer of 100) as well as a status attribute (Health: !). I am simply uncertain how to phrase the command.\n\nAlso, is there a way to destroy/remove an exit after the player does a specific action? I don't want the direction to be listed after that.\n\nThank you for any help you have.",
