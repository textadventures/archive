We sure seem to get a lot of them, and it's not always clear from the description whether they're sequels, remakes, or just another section of a game the author is writing as they go that shouldn't have been broken into pieces in the first place. (especially when it comes to some of these really short CYOAs, I really get the sense they got impatient and just wanted to shove what they had out the door for feedback without waiting to finish the rest.)\n\nI admit that, based on earlier experiences here, I usually just assume the latter and don't bother playing unless there's some really compelling evidence the author knows what they're doing, as in the case of the Victorian Detective games. Otherwise I basically just treat most of them like all the 'demos' that we also get too many of here.    \n\nAm I being unfair? Are there some gems I'm missing out on this way?",
