I have several questions which I have attempted to find answer for on the web as well as searching and searching here. Quest is pretty simple to use as far as I can see when it comes to creating rooms and objects, even NPC's. Where my questions come in is related to creating combat and classes or guilds. If there is anyone out there that may know of some good tutorial sites or be willing to assist me with trying to learn how to do this it would be much appreciated.",
