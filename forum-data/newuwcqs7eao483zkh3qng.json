This happens to characters that are read properly in other areas of the game, and randomly changing things in the game seems to change which characters are affected. I thought uploading the game might fix this, but they are still present when the game is reached through that page. (you can see for yourself) The only thing that seemed to fix this was exporting the file and opening it in the squiffy editor, but text adventures won't let me upload that file as a game because of an invalid file type (squiffyscript) and I have no clue how to convert that either. If you can help with any of this, please do!\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n--constant ",
