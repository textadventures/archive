      "EditableText": "Hi all,\n\nI apologise in advance if this topic has already been answered but I can't seem to find it anywhere. Basically I am writing my first game and there is a lot of interaction with NPCs. So far I have managed with ConvLib and making new objects for each conversation topic and using the Print Message script. I must point out I am not experienced in coding, so haven't been using code view, though I know I might have to.\n\nWhat I am looking to do is be able to make a menu of things to say to an NPC. Like speak to them in a different tone about things. Then based on which you choose then make new topics available. But I would like the original options to be gone, even if they weren't selected. For example:\n\nSpeak to James:\nDo you know anything about the murder aboard?\nWhere have you been this evening?\n\nThere would be a response to each of these, and then I would like a new menu to appear based on the choice of the first. So if the player chose option 1, then in the next menu option 2 would not be available but another 2 options would appear, and vice versa. \n\nReading through the forums I have come across speak about Menus, but am not sure how to implement them using ConvLib?\n\nMany thanks in advance, and I reiterate, I am a total noob!",
