I cant script so I'm using the in-game clickable script editor.\r\n\r\nI have it setup right now so that under the containers tap there is a script that runs when trying to put an object in the fire pit. It is an if statement that checks to see if \"this\" object has the attribute of name \"pit\".  If it does then it moves \"this\" object to object fire pit. Else it just prints a message saying \"You decide against putting this in the fire pit.\"\r\n\r\nSo I have an object called \"wood\" and added an attribute called \"pit\". So...... Shouldn't this in theory check to see if the object added has the attribute, which wood does, and then allow the wood to be placed into the fire pit? Because what keeps happening for me is it always comes up and says \"You decide against putting this in the fire pit.\"\r\n\r\nThank in advance, I hope I made that clear. I'm new here, first time poster. So bare with me. :)\r\n\r\nThanks again!",
