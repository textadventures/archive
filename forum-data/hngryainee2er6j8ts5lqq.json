Be yourself.\r\nPut yourself into any scenario and try not to stray too far from it.  This doesn't mean having all the characters be like you but you write the story as you would if speaking it. Draw upon who you are as a person and your writing will be genuine and far more believable with less effort. You can tweak or learn new skills and use them because they will still be based on who you are.\r\n\r\nCharacter building (not stats) is the hardest thing for me because I know how I would react to something but lack somewhat in the ability to really understand someone else's motivations. I am trying to write in a more narrative style so I can tell the story showing a person's motives in my own opinion which can lead to a learning experience or a real understanding of other people's emotional motives later in the story. I add a lot of humor because that's who I am. The Steve Martin of Text Adventure.",
