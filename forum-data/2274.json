      "EditableText": "Hi,\n\nI've only very recently downloaded Quest and have been playing around with it and struggling somewhat, so patience please!\n\nIn the Script Editor there is a very helpful option under the 'Other' menu which allows you to &quot;Enter next command into string value&quot;. This means, for example, you can get the player to give you their name, which your game can then use in future interactions.\n\nIs there a way of allowing the player to set numerical variables as well? What would I do, for example, if I was making a nation simulation game and wanted the player to set an income tax rate between 1 and 60%? \n\nAny help much appreciated!",
