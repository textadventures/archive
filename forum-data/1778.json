That way the author can still put his game up on the site (even if it sucks).

At the moment, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of categorising going on and all the drivel games are mixed in with the half decent ones. And more and more drivel is being uploaded each day and nothing seems to be done about it. Even the top 10 list is nothing to go by as most of the games there are unplayable tripe and the only really good Quest game ever written - Gathered in Darkness - isn't there.<br/><br/>*Is* something going to be done or are the few decent authors using Quest doomed to have their games lumped in with all the crap by dther, Gamer, emojo and the rest? Believe me, when a potential author comes along to Quest and has a look around, is he really going to want his game ranked alongside one that is described by the author as &quot;Hey, im back! with a cooler game! i know its been very long, so heres my best game yet!&quot;",
