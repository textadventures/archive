You will want to use a `foreach` loop, which lets you go over a list of objects and do the same thing to each one.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n<pre><code>foreach (<em style=\"color: blue\">object</em>, GetAllChildObjects (game.pov.parent)) {\r\n  if (HasInt (<em style=\"color: blue\">object</em>, \"<em style=\"color: green\">FRESHNESS</em>\")) {\r\n    <em style=\"color: blue\">object</em>.<em style=\"color: green\">FRESHNESS</em> = <em style=\"color: blue\">object</em>.<em style=\"color: green\">FRESHNESS</em> - 1\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\nWhere <em style=\"color: blue\">object</em> is an arbitrary name; you can call the variable whatever you want; and <em style=\"color: green\">FRESHNESS</em> is the name of the attribute.\r\n\r\nAs I previously mentioned, you must not `destroy` the object within this loop, as `foreach` generates an error if the list changes before it has finished. But you can do anything else you would normally do with an object.\r\n\r\n`GetAllChildObjects` gets a list of every object that is inside the room, or inside an object inside the room. You could use `ScopeReachable()` or `ScopeVisible()` instead; those only deal with objects the player can see (so not objects that are invisible or in a closed box)",
