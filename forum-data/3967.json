(Thanks for providing both.)\n\nI couldn't find any instructions for the convertor, so if I missed something, please point it out.\n\nThe game [i:i3ued0al]seemed[/i:i3ued0al] to compile (after some initial crashes due to spaces in file and maybe directory names), but the web game opens titled &quot;Game (Mobile)&quot;, rather than using the name I gave it in quest.\n\nI'm using a desktop, but the mobile version of the game is all that I can get to run?  It looks like the game should be responsive, leveraging bootstrap.   How do I get a desktop or responsive version of the converted game?\n\nThanks in Advance,\nJill",
