      "EditableText": "I just bought the new Hellsing OVA (if you're into anime) and it's the first episode of a ten episode series. The original series did not follow the manga, but the new OVA (Original Video Animation) is an episode that's roughly an hour for each volume of the manga. Although the original series was thirteen 23 min episodes, the new 1 hour episode is better than the entire original series combined.\n\nIf you're into anime and/or vampires, check out the new ep.\nIt's on DVD as Hellsing Ultimate Vol. 1 and it's quite spectacular. Excellent CG/Cell animation",
