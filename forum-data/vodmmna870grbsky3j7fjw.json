I may have done so before but it will have been closed now because of the 60-day, no-replies rule.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as we all know good TA are very few and far between, and while our recommendations can only ever be subjective, it should unearth the odd game that others may also enjoy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll start with this. I was on youtube the other day searching for stuff on TA and found a walkthrough for this game. I kind of wish I hadn't watched it becuase it spoiled my enjoyment of playing, but I think this is very good.\r\n\r\nI could have done without the interface and 'typewriter' effect, but certainly worth a playthrough.\r\n\r\nhttps://jonnocode.itch.io/the-house-abandon\r\n\r\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/PYx-sSdCSz8",
