      "EditableText": "Well... let's begin. In my experience, it is not the most common mistake. But I will play along.\r\n\r\nIf you are writing a STORY, you must remember what a story is. The equation is: Plot + Setting + Character = story. The so called three dimensional character is important for two reasons. The first reason is that if you are adding CHARACTER to the equation, it must count. It must be somewhat colorful and entertaining. The second, and most important reason, is that a character MUST have a transition of some sort. It is called polarization. Your main character - sometimes other characters too -must start the story one way and another one. I remember my directing classes at collage, my teacher used to ask \"who is the main character in this play?\". The trick is looking for what character has polarization. It is a good exercice and you will find out that nor Romeo, nor Juliette are main characters.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide the change for the character arch, your character must have some essence and a conflict to deal with. Basically, it has a state, a conflict, overcomes the conflict and becomes something different. In most stories, conflict is external. t is weak and wants to be srong, it is a nerd and wants to be popular or it is lonely and wants someone to love. But sometimes the conflict is internal. And both are ok. And you may even have both in the same character.\r\n\r\nAt the moment you state these things, you already have a dramatic character. Sometimes, writers adds a small thing ot two to add color. Color is something to spice up the character, but not a must to the drama. I always remember \"John Smith\", from \"The Dead Zone\". The color for this character was the weird habit of announcing what it was about to do. Going to bathroom, drink water, seekfor smeone, whatever.\r\n\r\nIt is important remembering that a fictional character is just a fictional character, It must not be less, but also must not be more. Another teacher I had at college once asked class to state one trait for \"Indiana Jones\" which is not in the movies. And no one could. The reason is because a character is not a person. It only exists in the dramaturgy and its traits may only happen inside the drama. Keep this in mind when designing a character. Stay focused on what is important for the story. If you begin to covey your audience a lot of irrelevant information to the story, just to prove you have designed a three dimensional or complex character, you will be risking an \"Info Dump\", what is actually one of the most common mistakes in story writing.\r\n\r\nOh, by the way, is not the fact a charecter be one dimensional, three dimensional or five dimensional that makes it move the story. It is action. And action is the key for a good dramaturgy, because we are all looking for a character who sees the problem, acts on the problem and faces the consequences of actions. Passive characters are bad characters. They may be passive at some extense, but not absolutely passive. ",
