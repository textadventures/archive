But, the ALIAS attribute is *NOT* used by the game engine to recognize~identify things, so you can have multiple things with the same ALIAS attribute.<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">In Code, for example</span>:</span><br/><br/>to CREATE (Add) a Name Attribute to an Object and~or an attribute (and to create~add an object and~or Attribute too, if that is what you've choosen to code):<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;orc_boss_1&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>OR, in this format (an old version but still useable format for attributes), the first word~string (orc_boss_1) is recognized as the NAME attribute:<br/><br/>&lt;orc_boss_1 type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/orc_boss_1&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;dead type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/dead&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;strength type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;50&lt;/strength&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;hit_points type=&quot;double&quot;&gt;5005.9813&lt;/hit_points&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;race type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;human&lt;/race&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;race_string_list type=&quot;simplestringlist&quot;&gt;human;
