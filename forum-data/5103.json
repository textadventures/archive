Putting the menu choices in a row across the screen instead of in a column? and for the normal column view, can there be an empty line between the choices to separate them?\n\nSecond, I'm trying to do something similar to the &quot;Return to previous room&quot; thread.\n\nI've created an item called &quot;beacon&quot; and want to be able to drop it in any room and then use a simple game command script like &quot;move object&quot; to move the player to the location of the beacon. In game when I try using &quot;move player object to beacon object&quot; script , it moves me INTO the beacon and gives a few dictionary/ coordinates errors as well, probably since I haven't done any setup on the item except create it.\n\nCan what I want be done be coded without complex scripting? If I cant' move to an object in a room, can I set the object so that I automatically exit it one I &quot;jump&quot; inside it to achieve the same thing in the end?\n\nThanks for any advice on these.",
