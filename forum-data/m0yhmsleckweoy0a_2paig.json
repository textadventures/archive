That’s all fine. I’m good with that.\r\n\r\nMy problem is I want it to be a bit harder for the player- the NPC they can add to the party has to be in the same room as the player for this command to work (cause irl it would be weird if you shouted to the sky “I summon ‘blah blah blahh’ and that person would teleport to you- cool)\r\n\r\nSorry if this is a stupid question I feel there’s a really obvious answer to this I’m missing >n<",
