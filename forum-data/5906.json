      "EditableText": "I almost hesitate to answer such questions, because Quest keeps changing underneath me, removing limitations. For example, you used to not be able to get text input directly, but now you can. All that aside, I would suspect that maps would not work in Gamebook mode because the map has to do with game world topology - rooms, exits, etc. Gamebooks don't have such topology; they don't even have the concept of rooms, at least in Quest.\n\nWhat would you want to use the map for in gamebooks? If you're trying to simulate world building in a gamebook, then I would recommend using a text adventure mode but have it look and act like a gamebook.",

      "EditableText": "Thanks for all the replies.\n\nBasically it is a high school freshmen class where we explore uses of technology.  For example we had a unit on video editing, 3D character creation and now game design.  Because we are spending 10 weeks on this unit, I wanted to make the execution of the design easy.  However I have a group of three students who have done the basics and want to move on with a special project.   We came up with a 'game' for incoming freshmen where they can wander around our building meeting teachers and staff.  Each room will have a photo of the teacher, a short description of the class and maybe a video of a typical class.  Yes there are better programs to do such a project, but we are learning Quest and I think it can be done.  The map was an idea that I consider a nice feature, but not a requirement.\n\nFrom what I've seen Quest will work.  It is a great product, easy to understand, yet it can be powerful.\n\nMark",
