In the character creation screen I make a choice for the player to be a Dark Elf and use set variable to change 'player_race' to 'darkelf' (makes it easier to code). However, when the player picks Dark Elf as their race, the status menu shows 'Race: darkelf'. Is there anyway to make the proper name display?\n\nIf it's not too much trouble I'd like to get all my help in QDK...I have no clue how to use the ASL editor yet. <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? -->",
