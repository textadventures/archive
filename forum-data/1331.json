The way I understand it is that if you want the variable to effect the entire game and all players it needs to be global if you want it player specific then you need it to be local, correct?\n\nNow assuming this if I change my stat var to local such as strength etc. So that each player has different stats I get a subscript out of range error. Either I'm totally off on the way I'm seeing this or I'm missing something else. Can anyone please explain this to me?",
