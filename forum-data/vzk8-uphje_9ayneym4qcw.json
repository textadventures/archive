You play as Gold, and you travel in the Johto region. The game is based off of Pokemon Gold, but there's aspects of it that are based off of other games too.\r\n\r\nI have updated the game. Here are the changes I've made since last time:\r\n\r\n1. I've gotten rid of the descriptions that make the Pokemon look like zombies (I was using code from the Pixie, and I hadn't removed/changed everything yet.) I changed ```ProcessText(\"A \" + obj.alias + \", {random:covered in maggots:missing an arm:one eye hanging out}.\")``` into ```ProcessText(\"A \" + obj.alias + \". A normal type. A very cautious Pokémon, it raises itself up using its tail to get a better view of its surroundings.\")```.\r\n2. I updated the Old Fisherman's dialogue. See for yourself!\r\n3. I changed \"Go out. East. North. West. Follow Silver.\" to \"Go to Silver. East. North. West. Follow Silver.\"\r\n\r\n Game link here. https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5jllte-m4e2e2whw4gf5jq/pokemon-type-harley-johto-and-sinnoh",

There is still the chance of getting stuck in a loop or two, but it's not endless.\r\n2. I made it so the player and the Pokemon teleport to the Battle Room, with an alias of \"battle\" so it says \"You are in battle,\" so it's harder for the player to run away from battle.\r\n3. I added new rooms and objects. In particular, Kurt's house, along with Kurt, is in Azalea Town.\r\n4. I added Apricorn bushes.\r\n5. I fixed buying and selling pokeballs. If you are in the player's room, the first room, you can use the password \"give me money,\" and you'll get 20000 pokedollars. Be aware that some may find this cheating. Alternatively, you can sell pokeballs, and get money that way, this is fair game.\r\n6. I've added 2 gym leaders. Temporarily, each gym leader has one or two Pokemon for a test battle. I made 2 gym badges in one room, then moved them to the player's inventory once the player defeated a certain Pokemon.\r\nThese are the gym leaders so far:\r\n\r\n* Falkner:\r\nPidgey\r\nPidgeotto\r\n\r\n* Bugsy:\r\nBeedrill\r\n\r\n7. I have made a few more new commands.\r\n___\r\n\r\nGame link here. https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5jllte-m4e2e2whw4gf5jq/pokemon-type-harley-johto-and-sinnoh",

There is still the chance of getting stuck in a loop or two, but it's not endless.</li>\n<li>I made it so the player and the Pokemon teleport to the Battle Room, with an alias of \"battle\" so it says \"You are in battle,\" so it's harder for the player to run away from battle.</li>\n<li>I added new rooms and objects. In particular, Kurt's house, along with Kurt, is in Azalea Town.</li>\n<li>I added Apricorn bushes.</li>\n<li>I fixed buying and selling pokeballs. If you are in the player's room, the first room, you can use the password \"give me money,\" and you'll get 20000 pokedollars. Be aware that some may find this cheating. Alternatively, you can sell pokeballs, and get money that way, this is fair game.</li>\n<li>I've added 2 gym leaders. Temporarily, each gym leader has one or two Pokemon for a test battle. I made 2 gym badges in one room, then moved them to the player's inventory once the player defeated a certain Pokemon.<br>\nThese are the gym leaders so far:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Falkner:<br>\nPidgey<br>\nPidgeotto</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugsy:<br>\nBeedrill</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>I have made a few more new commands.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Game link here. https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5jllte-m4e2e2whw4gf5jq/pokemon-type-harley-johto-and-sinnoh</p>\n\n",

You can also choose the gender and pronouns.\r\n\r\n3. I made new rooms for Route 42. I'm almost up to Mahogany Towm, meaning I'm more than half way through Johto now. I'm very excited!\r\n\r\nI'm also quite anxious to get new players, and to get the game done. I know getting the game done takes time and effort, but Ijust want it done! I know, I know, I've made two games already, I should be proud of myself. But I just want this game done! And I'm still comong up with new ideas for Fing game/Dante's Parody/Dante's Infarcer.
