      "EditableText": "think of the 'Objects' as containers of Attributes and/or other Objects, and Attributes as containers of Data (or of actions: Script Attributes). \r\n\r\nin the Text Adventure, you got (can create/add) unlimited Objects, and all of these can contain Attributes\r\n\r\nin code, you'll see:\r\n\r\nplayer.strength = 100\r\n\r\n'player' is the Object, the 'dot/period' is saying that 'strength' (the Attribute) is 'attached to' (contained within) the 'player' Object, and the '100' is the data that the Attribute is holding/storing (containing). An Attribute always includes the Object containing it, as these are all different/separate/individual Attributes:\r\n\r\nplayer.strength = 100\r\ngame.strength = 100\r\norc.strength = 25\r\nogre.strength = 75\r\n\r\nin the GUI/Editor, it has you 'add'/create Attributes to an Object, but underneath, it's creating/'adding' the Attribute to be contained within/by that Object.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nit doesn't matter (for the most part) functionally what Object is containing what Attribute, but for us humans, you should do what is conceptually logical, for example:\r\n\r\nplayer.strength = 100, makes sense\r\n\r\nwhereas:\r\n\r\ngame.strength = 100, doesn't make sense\r\n\r\nboth work fine, but 'game.strength = 100' doesn't make conceptual logical sense.\r\n\r\nsame as this too:\r\n\r\nplayer.game_greeting = \"Hi welcome to my game, I hope you enjoy it!\", doesn't make much sense\r\n\r\nwhereas, this does:\r\n\r\ngame.game_greeting = \"Hi welcome to my game, I hope you enjoy it!\"\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nmaybe the best example is using the Game Book, as it's limited to only two Objects that you can create Attributes for:\r\n\r\nthe 'game' Game Settings Object\r\nand the 'player' Player Object\r\n\r\nwhile, you only got these two Objects, you can still create the effect of having more Objects:\r\n\r\nplayer.orc_strength = 100\r\nplayer.orc_current_life = 100\r\nplayer.orc_dead = false\r\nplayer.orc_weapon = \"club\"\r\n\r\nplayer.dragon_strength = 500\r\nplayer.dragon_current_life = 999\r\nplayer.dragon_dead = false\r\nplayer.dragon_weapon = \"fire_breath\"\r\n\r\n--- or ----\r\n\r\ngame.orc_strength = 100\r\ngame.orc_current_life = 100\r\ngame.orc_dead = false\r\ngame.orc_weapon = \"club\"\r\n\r\ngame.dragon_strength = 500\r\ngame.dragon_current_life = 999\r\ngame.dragon_dead = false\r\ngame.dragon_weapon = \"fire_breath\"\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nboth work fine, but which makes more sense?\r\n\r\nobviously using the 'player' Player Object doesn't make any sense to us humans\r\n\r\nwhereas, using the 'game' Game Settings Object makes better/some sense to us humans\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nAttributes (that) are contained within Objects, are NOT destroyed (they are \"permanent\") and are global (able to use/reference them from anywhere in your game), so long as the Object containing the Attribute exists/still-exists, of course.\r\n\r\nthis makes Attributes extremely useful for game makers: being able to permanently store and get/reference data from anywhere and/or at any time within their game.\r\n\r\nfor example, once I create/add this Attribute (as code scripting, as I'm lazy):\r\n\r\nplayer.damage = 100\r\n\r\nI can now use that anywhere and at any time within my game, as well as being able to change/adjust/manipulate its stored value too, for examples (in code, as creation tags):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<object name=\"room\">\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"room_50\">\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"room_99\">\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"player\">\r\n  <attr name=\"parent\" type=\"object\">room</attr>\r\n  // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n  // the scripting that I showed above (aka: player.strength = 100), does/creates this for you:\r\n  // (you'd have to have that scripting of 'player.strength = 100', be somewhere that can contain scripting, of course, see the 'smith' Object, for an example of where/what such scripting can be placed/put/added-to)\r\n\r\n  <attr name=\"strength\" type=\"int\">100</attr>\r\n\r\n  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  </attr name=\"current_life\" type=\"int\">999</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"damage\" type=\"int\">100</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"bahamut\">\r\n  <attr name=\"parent\" type=\"object\">room_99</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"alias\" type=\"string\">Bahamut (King of Dragons)</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"dead\" type=\"boolean\">false</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"current_life\" type=\"int\">9999</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"damage\" type=\"int\">400</attr> // I changed it from '500', so that (now only doing 400 damage to you), you'll be able to kill it (with the tempering from the smith), just to be a bit more thorough for this example, lol\r\n  // this is the 'attack' Verb (yes, Verbs are just Script Attributes but with some addition coding elsewhere to make it function-as/be a Verb), that you would create/add in the GUI/Editor to the 'bahamut' Object (and it's the same for the 'smith.temper' Script Attribute below: on the 'smith' Object):\r\n  <attr name=\"attack\" type=\"script\">\r\n    <![CDATA[\r\n      if (bahamut.dead) {\r\n        msg (bahamut.alias + \" is already dead, silly.\")\r\n      } else {\r\n        player.current_life = player.current_life -

Then, save it, obviously. Now close/get out of it.\r\n\r\n6. now you can open it up in the GUI/Editor and study how its done, and you can play it too, to see it in action / working (assuming I don't make any mistakes, lol). Let me know if it doesn't work and/or if you need help with anything.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nI'm still using an older version of quest (550), so if it doesn't work, first try (in my game code below) changing the version to:\r\n\r\n(you can see your version number by opening up quest in the GUI/Editor, and in the menu bar at the top, is 'about', this tells you your 'quest.exe' quest engine's/software's download's version number: ignore the decimal numbers, and the 1's column regardless of what it says, will always be zero for how you add/write it to your game code: version=\"##0\", or just see below)\r\n\r\n```\r\n// the current most recent version is:\r\n\r\n<asl version=\"560\">\r\n// or:\r\n<asl version=\"570\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso... I hope the 'gameid' random generated hash string works... if not... just create a new game, open into the game code (right click, and open with text editor software), highlight and copy its 'gameid' randomly generated has string, delete this new game file, and then paste its gameid into my game code's 'gameid' below for your 'example.aslx' (you could have copied the new game code that it had when you created your new game: 'example.aslx', before you deleted its code and replaced it with my code, and then paste that 'gameid' into my code for your 'example.aslx' game file)\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"example_game\">\r\n\r\n    <gameid>14940bcf-bfa0-45ad-8c7c-4ec787b5586b</gameid>\r\n\r\n    <version>1.0</version>\r\n    <firstpublished>2017</firstpublished>\r\n    <author>HegemonKhan</author>\r\n    <category>DEMO</category>\r\n    <description>This demo game is 100% publically available to anyone/everyone, feel free to use it or parts of it, and/or modify it  or parts of it, and then use it or parts of it.

I think the 'null' issue is that since it (the Attribute's Value) is 'null' the Attribute is seen by quest as 'not existing', and hence the error when trying to increase/change or set/re-set it's value, it has to be made 'un-nulled' first, then we can increase/change/set/re-set the Attribute's value...
