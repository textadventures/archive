Its a pokemon type game, but I got permission from Monsters MMORPG to use there art work since this is not for profit. And some fan made art too. But here is a shot of some prototype battle play. If this game will be liked and played there will be lots more added to it.\r\n\r\n<https://imgur.com/9Pi8yTa> \r\n\r\nI hope to have it in beta phase in a few days ;) ",
