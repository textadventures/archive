I've searched for ages through the documentation and through other forum posts and haven't yet found what I'm after.\r\n\r\nBasically, I have a room called hallway. Inside hallway is an \"object and/or room\" called cupboard. \r\n\r\nI want players to be able to look at, open and close the cupboard, put things in and take them out of it etc.  All that's fine. But I also want people to be able to climb into the cupboard.\r\n\r\nI tried setting an exit from hallway to the cupboard (and vice versa), using the normal directional method. But when I then use the exit, it glitches out the map, puts the cupboard too far outside of the room. I don't want the map to show the cupboard outside of the hallway at all.\r\n\r\nSo I tried using the \"In\" exit command. But I can't figure out how to choose that exit when in the hallway.\r\n\r\nCan anyone point me in the direction of a tutorial for how to set up a cupboard object that is also a room that you can climb into, while staying inside the parent room that the cupboard is in?",
