I know I can't use ClearScreen because that seems to delete the existing content completely and I need to be able to get it back. But I only want that room's worth of content up until when the player entered the fight.\r\n\r\nI know about the ```StartNewOutputSection()``` then ```EndOutputSection``` then ```HideOutputSection ``` method but that seems  to delete the content like ClearScreen does. Maybe there's some way of using this ```JS.uiHide (\"#divOutputAlign3\")``` followed by ```JS.uiShow (\"#divOutputAlign3\")``` for all the divOutputs on the page so far but... \r\n1. I don't know how to tell what range of number outputs have been created (obviously it  won't always be 3) \r\n2. I don't know how to code them all to hide and then show because there could be a lot of them\r\n3. I don't know how to get the game to then show the fight outcome at the end and go back to playing like normal\r\n\r\nI read [this post](https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/ik0dbblaq0o5fdqq7nuwia/js-function-to-find-the-last-divoutputalign-in-a-saved-game-solved) and [this linked post](https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/ik0dbblaq0o5fdqq7nuwia/js-function-to-find-the-last-divoutputalign-in-a-saved-game-solved#14cb0c29-3383-4c85-ae2b-611a9ae81558) which seem like they're related to my problem but I'm not good enough at Quest code to really understand what's going on...\r\n\r\nThank you so much to anyone who is able to help!",
