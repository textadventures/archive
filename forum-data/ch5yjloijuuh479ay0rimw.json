Anyone else having trouble with this? Saving was broken when the site finally was fixed after games not running for two weeks, then it seems to have broken again pretty profoundly. At this point, I'll probably just use the web version as a preview, since saving seems to be something you can't be guaranteed any longer, and just encourage people to download the game. Very disappointing.",
