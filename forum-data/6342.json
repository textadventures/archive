Having an issue with Quest only running a partial script.\n\nUsing the online Quest program, I have an object that I set up using the use/give command.\n\nI set it up to handle objects individually.   When one gives an object to another, I want it to take three actions. 1) Move the object to the other - in this case giving sheep to a Shepherd  2) print a message and 3) unlock an exit.\n\nI get no error messages, but when I test this all that happens is the object gets moved.  No message prints and the exit remains locked.\n\n\nThe Code view looks like this:\n\nMoveObject (Flock of sheep, Old Shepherd)\nmsg (&quot;The Old Shepherd nods and beckons the sheep who seem willing to go with him.&quot;)\nUnlockExit (loft ladder)\n\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?  Any help will be appreciated!",

If the same thing happens (sheep still move, no message), then something else is moving the sheep. Check the Use/Give tab of both the sheep and the shepherd to see if that is possible (code left from failed attempts for example).",
