Now, I have a few quick questions that weren't covered, or else were only touched upon, in the tutorial. Any input on any of these questions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n1. Is it possible to have the player converse with an NPC about a particular subject while in one specific room, then later have that same NPC appear in another specific room, where the player can converse with him/her on a different subject?\r\n\r\n2. If there is a door in the room that has writing on it or some other distinguishing marks/characteristics, and I want the player to see them, should I create both an exit and a door object? Or would it be better to simply include a description of the door in the room description, and skip making a door object?",
