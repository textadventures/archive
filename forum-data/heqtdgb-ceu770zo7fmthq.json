I was thinking using ShowMenu and then using CallFunction in order to go from one menu to another. It works well for the first batch of mails I receive, but as soon as the second round needs to come into my inbox, things become extremely complicated and I can't get it to work. This is the script I found here and tried to make it work:\r\n```\r\ntopics = Split (\"What mission?;I was born ready!;Err.. what mission?;Actually I am having second thoughts about it.\", \";\")\r\nShowMenu (\"\", topics, true) {\r\n  switch (result) {\r\n    case (\"What mission?\") {\r\n      msg (\"Viconia smiles. 'Oh don't be so coy. Haven't you heard you are going to Gliese 667 Cc?'\")\r\n      speak_to_android_female_mission\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"I was born ready!\") {\r\n      msg (\"'Good.'\")\r\n      speak_to_android_female_mission\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"Err.. what mission?\") {\r\n      msg (\"'Mission to Gliese 667 Cc.'\")\r\n      speak_to_android_female_mission\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"Actually I am having second thoughts about it.\") {\r\n      msg (\"'Oh don't worry about it.'\")\r\n      speak_to_android_female_mission\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tried using the ConvLib library made by Pixie. Her library works great with dialogues, but when it comes to a computer, I cant get it to work properly. Namely, I can't make it read follow-on topics. I can consult the computer only once and then the dialogue shuts down. Here is my whole test script, so hopefully someone can help me to get it to work properly. As you can see, the two dialogues are set up identically for character and for consultable, but the consultable part just doesnt work for some reason. \r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\n```<!--Saved by Quest
