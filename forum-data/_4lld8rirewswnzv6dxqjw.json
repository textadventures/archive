      "EditableText": "Wow! I must say I am very happy for having a debate with mrangel and The Pixie - Right two people I strongly respect and admire in this community.\r\n\r\nI dont thing the two ideas exposed by mrangel are wrong in the core, but they are shifted to a different angle. When I say that Parser is for puzzles, I mean there is a component of try and error, combine things and try the effect and this sort of things. Nothing is \"impossible\", but some approches are harder and some tools are more appropriate. For example, Quest has the Parser mode and the Gamebook mode. I shifted the approach on the Parser mde to write Gamebooks because it is a better tool for non-programming users to program. Actually, the point where the parser breaks the story telling is tryng things and getting weird inputs, but a story would support it or we could just pretend it is \"believeble\" as it happened so many times in games like Indiana Jones or the Monkey Island.\r\n\r\nI also agree with you that an easy software for design games is a good thing and that if a given person is poorly writing a story or designing a game, it would be bad in any system. However, when you have to put some effort to make a game because it is hard, you have to make it worthy. I believe it was Pixie's point. A couple of days ago I did read a blog about a guy telling how mastering coding didnt help him on making actual games and that other skills are far more valuable as a starting point to develop a game and THEN bring the coder into the team than knowing coding and THEN bring other skills to the team. But this point we see everyday. 30 years ago, to mock or bother someone and feel as a troll, you had to write a letter with a pen, put in an envelope, walk to the mail box, pay for the stamps. Today, just log on server and say whatever comes to your mind. I suppose the same goes on games. \r\n\r\nReminds me a story I did read some years ago, set in Warhammer 40K universe. The nun had a pen covered in throns. If you are going to write something, it must worth the pain.",

I must say I am very happy for having a debate with mrangel and The Pixie - Right two people I strongly respect and admire in this community.</p>\n<p>I dont thing the two ideas exposed by mrangel are wrong in the core, but they are shifted to a different angle. When I say that Parser is for puzzles, I mean there is a component of try and error, combine things and try the effect and this sort of things. Nothing is \"impossible\", but some approches are harder and some tools are more appropriate. For example, Quest has the Parser mode and the Gamebook mode. I shifted the approach on the Parser mde to write Gamebooks because it is a better tool for non-programming users to program. Actually, the point where the parser breaks the story telling is tryng things and getting weird inputs, but a story would support it or we could just pretend it is \"believeble\" as it happened so many times in games like Indiana Jones or the Monkey Island.</p>\n<p>I also agree with you that an easy software for design games is a good thing and that if a given person is poorly writing a story or designing a game, it would be bad in any system. However, when you have to put some effort to make a game because it is hard, you have to make it worthy. I believe it was Pixie's point. A couple of days ago I did read a blog about a guy telling how mastering coding didnt help him on making actual games and that other skills are far more valuable as a starting point to develop a game and THEN bring the coder into the team than knowing coding and THEN bring other skills to the team. But this point we see everyday. 30 years ago, to mock or bother someone and feel as a troll, you had to write a letter with a pen, put in an envelope, walk to the mail box, pay for the stamps.
