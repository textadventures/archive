I'm trying to show a menu to ask what gender your character is, but when I select the option of female it doesn't carry out the assigned code, only on the male or first option. Here is the code I used\r\n```\r\noptions = Split(\"Male; Female\", \";\")\r\n      ShowMenu (\"What gender is your character?\", options, false) {\r\n        switch (result) {\r\n          case (\"Male\") {\r\n            msg (\"So your character is a man.\")\r\n            player.sex_type = \"male\"\r\n          }\r\n          case (\"Female\") {\r\n            msg (\"So your character is a women.\")\r\n            player.sex = \"female\"\r\n          }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nAny ideas why this is? I might be where I placed it in the rest of the code which I can also provide if needed.",
