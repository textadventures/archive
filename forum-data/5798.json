I ask because I think most players that come to the site look on the first page and that is it.  If it's not there, they never see it.  So, if there were, say, 6-9 games in each of the categories (editor's picks, top rated, latest, and classics) they at least might stay on the main page for a few days.  Or, better yet, have a whole new category where a select few games go that are elaborate and thoughtful - maybe a couple trusted moderators can only route games to that category?  Every game I have played that has been [b:264hxo4s]publicly[/b:264hxo4s] published (and it has been a LOT) in the last month or so has been pretty much garbage with the exception of a small handful.  You can call me a TA elitist or a TA snob, but... correct me if I am mistaken.  Please.\n\nWithout advertising and commenting on my own recently released game (which I will not do) just to get it mentioned in the 'New Feed', it is quickly on its way into the released games that very few that venture to this site will ever see.  I admit, I'm a bit salty, that after 10 plays while on the home page (for about 40 hours), X2 got bumped from the latest games category after three UNFINISHED games made their way on to the 'latest games' list, when in fact they are probably better left in the uncategorized or sandpit category.\n\nOn top of that... there are 14/18 (or close to that) games on the first page of the 'latest games' page that have been categorized that are not complete.  Hell, a handful of them only have ONE room!\n\nYou can give me that 'as long as you enjoyed making the game' it was worth it bit... and I half buy that... X2 was a journey in madness, happiness, frustration, and accomplishment regardless of who plays it or how many play it.  I really did have fun making it and I'm proud of it, but the bottom line is that I DO want people to play it.  Yes... I'm a bit biased.  I know that.  I apologize if I sound like a big baby.  I will continue to create games because I enjoy it that much.  It makes me wonder, however, how many really good games have been created on this site that I'll never know about.
