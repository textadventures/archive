I'm thinking that I could move Phil to the current room when the player phones him, but the problem is if the player 'looks' they will see him, I could make him scenery but they could still 'examine phil', you could also give things to Phil which also wouldn't make sense!\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this or am I wasting my time?",
