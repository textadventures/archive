When you save, it adds one to the value. And then when you want to return to the save point, it keeps on undoing until the value goes down. If there's a cost for returning to a save point, you would have to apply that cost after all the 'undo' steps. Because \"undo\" restores the previous value of objects and their attributes, but not local variables.\r\n\r\nYou could do something like:\r\n```\r\nif (HasInt (game, \"savepoints_reached\")) {\r\n  x = game.savepoints_reached\r\n  while (Equal (game.savepoints_reached, x)) {\r\n    undo\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if you only want to be able to go back one savepoint, you could \"save\" using:\r\n```\r\ngame.is_savepoint = true\r\nstart transaction (game)\r\ngame.is_savepoint = false\r\n```\r\nand later return to that point using:\r\n```\r\nif (HasBoolean (game, \"is_savepoint\")) {\r\n  while  (not  GetBoolean (game, \"is_savepoint\")) {\r\n    msg (\"Undoing command: {game.pov.currentcommand}.\")\r\n    undo\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // insert any XP penalties here\r\n  game.is_savepoint = false\r\n  msg (\"Save point reached!\")\r\n\r\n  // Showing the description might be useful to let the player know where they are\r\n  ShowRoomDescription\r\n\r\n  // And you need to refresh the map if you want to  remove any areas that the player hasn't explored yet\r\n  if (GetBoolean (game, \"gridmap\")){\r\n    Grid_DrawPlayerInRoom (game.pov.parent)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You haven't reached a savepoint yet.\")\r\n}\r\n```",
