But every time I try to upload the file, I get a weird runtime error after a few minutes. When I was publishing the game, it did warn me that it's over 20 MB in size, so I compressed all of my images, which still didn't work. I have images and mp3 files for each page (it's a gamebook). I've tried on two different browsers, Chrome and Brave. Is this a common issue? Is there a fix? Is it because the images and music is too large? How can I reduce the size, if so? Thanks!",

This would also remove the limitations regarding the size and give you control over who can access this file. Your family members would need a quest client in order to play the game though.",
