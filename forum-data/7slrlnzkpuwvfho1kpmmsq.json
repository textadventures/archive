Now I've tested it to death myself and would really appreciated some help.  If anyone is willing to give it a try I would really welcome the feedback/comments.\r\n\r\n_Pathway to Destruction_ is a sci-fi/time travel game about a technician who is working on a new transportation project when something goes wrong.  Finding yourself thrown into an empty and desolate future, finding out what went wrong is your first priority. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested let me know in this thread or PM me and I'll send the link.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.",
