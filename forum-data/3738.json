In the main they're bad, I guess people don't like to give bad reviews. You'll play a few bad ones and then an ok one will come along that you then over rate as it's just so much better (even just a better concept) than the rest of them. Like losing a fiver then finding five pence. On the flip side I probably didn't have much patience for ones that I could have perservered with. I tried not to be too harsh but it's hard when virtually zero effort has been put into something.",
