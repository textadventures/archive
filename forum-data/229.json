I use this in a status variable display as so:\ndisplay &lt;%HP% / #object:MAXHP#&gt; (well - something similar)\n\nThis generates 200 / 200 (or something like that when you start up).\n\nNow when you change the object's property, to say 250, it doesn't change in the status variable....\n\nIs there a way you could have it so we can manually refresh or change the display of the status variable?",
