I am using The Pixie's Clock library, [url:17ssc5ey]http&#58;//quest5&#46;net/wiki/Clock_Library[/url:17ssc5ey], and am having trouble with the boolean functions for time of day. \n\nExample:\nI'm trying to have a room display a different description for each time of day. So, I call function IsMorning (no parameters), IF expression = TRUE then print message. Elseif, call function IsDusk, IF expression = TRUE etc...\n\n[i:17ssc5ey]Note: I am new to Quest and am using the GUI mostly, but am not afraid of code and am trying to learn more as I go.[/i:17ssc5ey]\n\nSo, what is occurring instead of the desired result is that all messages from all times of day are being printed which leads me to believe that I'm doing something wrong as far as passing the IsMorning boolean into the IF command. \n\nThis silly little hiccup is preventing any progress on my project, so any help is greatly appreciated!",
