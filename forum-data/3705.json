      "EditableText": "So the simplest way I can think of is as follows:\n\nChange the Lounge Room description from &quot;text&quot; to &quot;script&quot;. For the script, you need to tell it what to print for each option, so create an if... script to begin with and use conditions based on what the parent of each of those objects is:\n\nif - (toys.parent=lounge room) and (rubbish.parent=lounge room)\n  then: print message x\n\nelse if (toys.parent=lounge room)\n  then print message y\n\nelse if rubbish.parent=lounge room\n  then print message z\n\nelse\n  then print a message if neither the toys or rubbish are in the lounge room.\n\n\nThat is what you should do if the description changes significantly for each permutation. If having the object in the room just adds another part of the description rather than changing or subtracting the entire description, then you could go about it differently. e.g. have a script that says:\n\nprint first part of description.\n\nif rubbish.parent=lounge room\n  then print next part of the description.\n\nif toys.parent=lounge\n  then print another part of the description.\n\n\nIt all depends whether these different combinations are additive (each object adds another sentence) or transformative (each object affects all of the sentences).",
