But I would like to learn how to create such books myself without intermediaries.\r\n\r\nI had a question or a problem (as someone who likes to call it). In each book there are \"Chapters\". Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, etc. I start with the \"Introduction\". After 5 pages - 1 chapter. After another 5 pages - 2 chapter. How can I make the code in the program so that I, from, for example, chapter 5, can go into chapter 2? I also want the chapters to open gradually. That I had a separate menu, which will list the chapters. But playing in chapter 1 so that there are not all chapters in this list. To chapters opened as you progress through the game.\r\n\r\nHelp me please!\r\n\r\nSorry for my bad english.",
