The keywords I entered were &quot;chemistry&quot; and &quot;book,&quot; being that it's a chemistry book. But when I ask him about, say, &quot;babies&quot; in the game, he responds with the dialogue I've written for when he is asked about the chemistry book. Turns out he mistakes ANYTHING for &quot;chemistry book&quot; as long as I write &quot;Ask Mitch about ...&quot; before it. Can this be fixed?\n\nEdit: I found the &quot;Script to run when asked about an unknown topic&quot; option and added dialogue. He still yaps off about his chemistry book when I ask him about &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;jock itch.&quot;",
