There's no error or anything. It just won't progress past turn 59. I thought maybe I had written it incorrectly at first so I tried...\r\nplayer.turnscriptcount = player.turnscriptcount + 1\r\nplayer.turnscriptcount = player.turnscriptcount + 59\r\nand even reenabling the turn script after that turn, but nothing seems to work. \r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas if this is a bug or if something else is going on?
