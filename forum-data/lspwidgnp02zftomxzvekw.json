However, it sounds like it might mean every game created weighs the server down a tiny amount. five games with 20 commands each would have the ßame as one game with 100, afterall .I do hope with future improvements, the game engine will be able to take on even more work.\r\nThe games I was working on when I asked that were published to City Art Centre quest text adventure page. \r\n",
