I had success with the cloning part, but I can't figure out how to remove the clones or set the number to 0.\n\nHere is how I cloned the objects. (I have a stackable library.) I've never cloned things in a game before and I've been reading up, but haven't found the answer to this question.\n\n[code:1k68c78w]msg (&quot;You take out the axe and begin chopping down the tree&#46; It's hard work&#46; You can feel yourself gaining strength&#46;&quot;)\nb = Clone(Wood 1)\nstack (b)[/code:1k68c78w]\n\nThanks all.",
