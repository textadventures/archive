      "EditableText": "Hi, I'm new to Quest, and I can't seem to figure out nor find a solution to my problem. I'm using the latest desktop version of Quest.\r\n\r\nMy question is, how can I make it where a certain object can only be used in specific rooms?\r\n\r\nLet's say, I want to be able to have the main character change clothes(So the object being a Shirt, for example), but only in rooms that can be considered \"private\", so if a room has another character in it, or you're in a public space, you can't use the object/shirt at all.\r\n\r\nI have a house mapped out, where the MC's room, his sister's room, the bathroom, living room, and kitchen exist. I only want the MC's room and bathroom to be places where the object can be \"used\".\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this? Without going into the heavy scripting part of Quest?",

      "EditableText": "I would, as DarkLizerd suggests, set flags on the rooms that are private.  I think the easiest way to do this is on the after entering room script.  In that section, just add the script 'set flag' on an object (like the player) and name the flag private.  Make sure that you add a script to 'unset flag' when you leave that room.  Some coders might tell you that setting flags on the player is unwise, so if you want to set a flag on something else, just set it on any other object in the game.  Hell, you could create an object called 'private', make it invisible, and just use it to set/unset a private flag.\r\n\r\nYou have two options, I think, for changing your clothes.  you can add a global command and type - change clothes; change shirt; switch clothes - etc (whatever you want as an accepted synonym for changing clothes) and run an 'If' script and select 'if object has flag' object (wherever you placed the flag (player?) named private, 'then' run your proper scripts.\r\n\r\nOption 2 - add the verb 'wear' to whatever objects the player has that they could wear.  Check to see if your private flag is set, and run the proper scripts.  Else  print message \"This room is not private enough to strip down to your birthday suit.  Try another room.\"\r\n\r\nIf you need more help, I'd be glad to post code or send you a small sample game.\r\n\r\nGood luck.",
