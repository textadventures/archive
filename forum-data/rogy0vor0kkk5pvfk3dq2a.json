Maybe there's some games that you can't even use Assembly Language to 'hex editor' hack the game's data, but there are some games where you can do this, as everyone is probably aware of. Ultimately, maybe the only protection is the use of force (courts/law/law enforcement). The movie industry is the best example, surely having paid off the FBI, to punish anyone plagerizing movies, as you see the warning on every movie made, but you don't see such a warning for any other media/industry... Movie industry must have paid off the FBI to be in bed with the FBI... as they're the only ones to have such strong protection by the FBI.",
