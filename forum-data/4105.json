For example: You enter a room and each time you enter the room (for instance...you died and have to re-enter room) it displays different objects/items you can interact with using hyperlinks. I tried the random text, but that only generates random text that you can't interact with. Basically, all I need is random objects/items I can interact with each time a room is loaded.\n\nThank You\nInsertCoin25",

For example, when you &quot;respawn&quot; in the room, are the objects you find there taken from a pool of existing objects (e.g. you find a sword, but there is only one sword ever) or do they need to be created dynamically (e.g. you have a healing potion, and in the room you can find another)?\n\nIf it's the former, then you can just have a list of possible objects that can appear in the room, and then randomly select from that list, moving the desired objects into the room.

You can either use an object list (which directly references the objects), or you can use a string list that contains the names of the objects. The latter requires you to use GetObject to get the actual object from the name. The only advantage to the string list is that you can create and edit it in the Quest editor. The editor doesn't know how to deal with object list attributes.\n\nI decided to punt and not use a static list but rather generate the list by which objects were in a source room. Some code to examine is follows. Note that I have Quest 5.5 installed, so if you have 5.4, you'll have to change the asl version or dump the code into your own game.\n\n[code:qh36baza]&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;5&#46;5101&#46;21548--&gt;\n&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;objlist_text&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;cd9e7a8a-fb1a-4bb3-8c90-cc19b37793aa&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2014&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n    &lt;objects type=&quot;objectlist&quot;&gt;&lt;/objects&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;beforeenter type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n      MoveRandomObjects (limbo, this, 3)\n    &lt;/beforeenter&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;exit alias=&quot;south&quot; to=&quot;otherroom&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;southdirection&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/exit&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;limbo&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;take /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;banana&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;take /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;monkey&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;take /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;drum&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;take /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;stick&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;take /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;doll&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;take /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;otherroom&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;exit alias=&quot;north&quot; to=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;northdirection&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/exit&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;function name=&quot;MoveRandomObjects&quot; parameters=&quot;source, destination, count&quot;&gt;\n    if (not HasAttribute(source, &quot;objects&quot;)) {\n      set (source, &quot;objects&quot;, GetDirectChildren(source))\n    }\n    objects = GetAttribute(source, &quot;objects&quot;)\n    foreach (object, objects) {\n      object&#46;parent = source\n    }\n    set (source, &quot;tempobjects&quot;, objects)\n    tempobjects = GetAttribute(source, &quot;tempobjects&quot;)\n    for (i, 1, count) {\n      index = GetRandomInt(0, ListCount(tempobjects)-1)\n      object = ListItem(tempobjects, index)\n      list remove (tempobjects, object)\n      object&#46;parent = destination\n    }\n  &lt;/function&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:qh36baza]\nThe basic idea behind this is that there is a room that holds the objects you want. I called it &quot;limbo&quot; in the example. Then there is a function called MoveRandomObjects that moves the specified number of objects from the source room to the target room. In order to know what the objects are, the function assumes that the first time it's called, the objects are all in the source room. It captures that list for later use. It also resets all the objects back into the source room before selection. You can see this if you go south in the example and then back north again. Every time you enter the room, a new selection of objects will be there. If you had any of the objects in your possession, they will be moved back to limbo and selected a new.\n\nThis may be more complicated than you wanted. In order to pick &quot;n&quot; objects, I had to create a temporary list to pluck objects from. I use that fact that when you assign a list to an object attribute, it copies the list. So when I set the &quot;tempobjects&quot; attribute from &quot;objects&quot;, it makes a copy of objects we can remove objects from.\n\nI couldn't put comments in the source that would stick, so it's a bit &quot;self documenting&quot;. If you have any questions about how any of it works, I'll be happy to explain.\n\nHope that gets you at least part way on your way! (And sorry again for the delay getting back to you.)",

Note that I have Quest 5.5 installed, so if you have 5.4, you'll have to change the asl version or dump the code into your own game.<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;5&#46;5101&#46;21548--&gt;<br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;objlist_text&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;cd9e7a8a-fb1a-4bb3-8c90-cc19b37793aa&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2014&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>    &lt;objects type=&quot;objectlist&quot;&gt;&lt;/objects&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;beforeenter type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>      MoveRandomObjects (limbo, this, 3)<br/>    &lt;/beforeenter&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;exit alias=&quot;south&quot; to=&quot;otherroom&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;southdirection&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/exit&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;limbo&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;take /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;banana&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;take /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;monkey&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;take /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;drum&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;take /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;stick&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;take /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;doll&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;take /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;otherroom&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;exit alias=&quot;north&quot; to=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;northdirection&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/exit&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;function name=&quot;MoveRandomObjects&quot; parameters=&quot;source, destination, count&quot;&gt;<br/>    if (not HasAttribute(source, &quot;objects&quot;)) {<br/>      set (source, &quot;objects&quot;, GetDirectChildren(source))<br/>    }<br/>    objects = GetAttribute(source, &quot;objects&quot;)<br/>    foreach (object, objects) {<br/>      object&#46;parent = source<br/>    }<br/>    set (source, &quot;tempobjects&quot;, objects)<br/>    tempobjects = GetAttribute(source, &quot;tempobjects&quot;)<br/>    for (i, 1, count) {<br/>      index = GetRandomInt(0, ListCount(tempobjects)-1)<br/>      object = ListItem(tempobjects, index)<br/>      list remove (tempobjects, object)<br/>      object&#46;parent = destination<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/function&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/>The basic idea behind this is that there is a room that holds the objects you want. I called it &quot;limbo&quot; in the example. Then there is a function called MoveRandomObjects that moves the specified number of objects from the source room to the target room. In order to know what the objects are, the function assumes that the first time it's called, the objects are all in the source room. It captures that list for later use. It also resets all the objects back into the source room before selection. You can see this if you go south in the example and then back north again. Every time you enter the room, a new selection of objects will be there. If you had any of the objects in your possession, they will be moved back to limbo and selected a new.<br/><br/>This may be more complicated than you wanted. In order to pick &quot;n&quot; objects, I had to create a temporary list to pluck objects from. I use that fact that when you assign a list to an object attribute, it copies the list. So when I set the &quot;tempobjects&quot; attribute from &quot;objects&quot;, it makes a copy of objects we can remove objects from.<br/><br/>I couldn't put comments in the source that would stick, so it's a bit &quot;self documenting&quot;. If you have any questions about how any of it works, I'll be happy to explain.<br/><br/>Hope that gets you at least part way on your way! (And sorry again for the delay getting back to you.)",
