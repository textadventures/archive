      "EditableText": "OK. So you want a script to run when the player enters a new room.\r\nYou want the `game.roomenter` script, which is called something like \"Script when entering a room\" on the 'Scripts' tag of the game.\r\n\r\nYou want it to check a flag on the player, for which you use the function `GetBoolean`, and you want a random chance, for which you use the function `RandomChance`.\r\n\r\nSo your script would look like:\r\n<pre><code>if (GetBoolean (game.pov, \"<em style=\"color: blue\">unlucky</em>\") and RandomChance (<em style=\"color: purple\">15</em>)) {\r\n  <em style=\"color: green\">// Put the code for your pickpocket event here</em>\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n(Where <tt style=\"color: blue\">unlucky</tt> is the name of your flag, and <tt style=\"color: purple\">15</tt> is the percentage chance of it happening each time the player enters a room - 15% will be about every 6 rooms on average)\r\n\r\nIf you'd rather do that using the GUI rather than code view, just create an \"If\" statement. Set its type to \"Expression\", and the expression will be <code>GetBoolean (game.pov, \"<em style=\"color: blue\">unlucky</em>\") and RandomChance (<em style=\"color: purple\">15</em>)</code>. (I realise this is probably unnecessary, but too many times lately I've posted code here and got the followup question how to enter it in the GUI, because copy-and-pasting a few lines of code is too hard)",
