All you have to do is add an extra parameter and name it 'script' or something, and at the end of the function, invoke it. Example:\n[code:2iaqn1ob]&lt;function name=&quot;TestFunction&quot; parameters=&quot;msg, script&quot;&gt;\n  msg (msg)\n  invoke (script)\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:2iaqn1ob]\nThis isn't a problem. However, if you try to call the function with the GUI, it doesn't allow you to add a script to it. Even if you go into code view and do something like this\n[code:2iaqn1ob]TestFunction (&quot;Blah&quot;) {\n  msg (&quot;Blah blah&#46;&quot;)\n}[/code:2iaqn1ob]\nWhen you go back to the GUI, all it will say in the parameters box is &quot;Blah&quot;.\nThis isn't a huge problem, and I don't think it actually removes the script (it just hides it), but it's a little irritating to go into the code view every time you have to change the script.",
