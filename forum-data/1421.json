I've forgotten practically everything in QDK so they WILL go step by step, but for ASL I may asume they have [i:2bcgjrg8]some[/i:2bcgjrg8] programming knowledge at least from QDK. I'm also planning a big section on making big rpg's, and may be turning hAvenHold into an online rpg library at some point (once it's finished)... But it's not going to be a library in the normal sense, but something you build your game around... If you understand me?",
