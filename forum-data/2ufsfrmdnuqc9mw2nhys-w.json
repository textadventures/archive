The standalone node player is really something, but I haven't been able to import my own test games successfully, however.  Based on what I saw with the blank.aslx it looked like a matter of injecting the core dependencies into the file itself, which I've attempted without success (specifically, it seems to \"defaultify\" my test games, I think by initializing the pov).  Am I just missing a step or is it just not ready for prime time yet?  I understand it's still in development, I was just wondering if the web player part of it at least is test drivable with Quest 5 files in its current state.",
