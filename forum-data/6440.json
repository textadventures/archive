      "EditableText": "Hi,\n\nI wonder if I could have some help with this issue please:\n\nMy game (The Zen Garden) was written on version 5.3\n\nA player has recently complained that the game seems to freeze/crash at a point which I suspect it's trying to play a sound file. Is this likely to be a compatibility issue, I wonder? He'll have encountered other sound files without crashing in order to reach that point, so perhaps it's something else...I'm unsure how to advise him. I would be sad to see my game become obselete but I don't have time to keep up with new iterations of Quest if they render it so.\n\nThanks very much in advance for you help.",
