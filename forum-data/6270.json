Using the editor *online* is fine, but I'd like to be able to use it *offline* as well, and would prefer that.  Problem is -- the text editor font is [b:16g2tgvh]way[/b:16g2tgvh] too small me. (Windows 10, crappy 1366 x 768 LCD screen).  Otherwise, it seems to work fine.\n\nIf there's a way to increase the font size in the offline text editor itself (the actual script/code you write), could someone tell me how?  Thanks.",

As I said, I have no problem using that version (as it's easy to expand a browser page).  I'm asking about the offline version that you download, and which runs as a standalone program on your computer.\n\nI can bring up the &quot;DevTools&quot; (F12) in the offline editor -- and set the font size for the 'Output' panel.
