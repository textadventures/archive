Who knows... maybe at the end of the year we can have a link on the home page where challenge \"winners\" are posted?  Maybe the winner gets to choose the theme for the next challenge?\r\n\r\nAnyway, here are some ideas that caught my eye when sifting through the website below.  I can see writing a text-adventure around any of these.\r\n\r\nJanuary - Appreciate a Dragon Day (16th)\r\nFebraury - Groundhog's Day, Presidential Theme, Children's Dental Health Day, Fat Tuesdsay\r\nMarch - Spring, Easter, Holy Experiment Day (4th)\r\nApril - April Fools, Easter, FYI... it's National Beer Day on the 7th!\r\nMay - Moms, In Memorium, Clean Up Your Room Day (10th), or Lumpy Rug Day (3rd)\r\nJune - Dads, Summer Theme, <strike>Choke</strike> Hug Your Cat Day (4th)\r\nJuly - Independence, Summer Theme, World UFO Day (2nd)\r\nAugust - International Beer Day Theme, \"Grab Some Nuts\" Day (what?!) (3rd)\r\nSeptember - Labor/work related, Fortune Cookie Day (13th)\r\nOctober - Halloween!, International Newspaper Carrier Day (10th)\r\nNovember - Thanksgiving, Veteran/War Theme, Men Make Dinner Day (1st), Dias Los Muertos\r\nDecember - Christmas, New Years, Bathtub Party Day (5th)\r\n\r\nI know a lot of these are American-related themes, but you get the idea. I think it might be fun to pull a few challenges from days \"dedicated\" from this site -- http://holidayinsights.com/moreholidays/\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
