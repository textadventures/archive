I had to add and rework quite a lot of code to make some of the new stuff possible so there are of course a whole raft of bugs and similar wobblies to sort out.\n\nI'm fixing the faults as fast as my testers find them, and the bug discovery rate has now slowed down to a trickle, so the libraries (Typelib is now a 'two-parter' so that you don't have to bloat games by including code they will never need) should be ready for a more public 'testing' soon.\n\nOnce the feature set is finally fixed, I can add the QDK interface and write a manual/demo piece, at present that would be premature.   \n\nThanks for your interest!\n\nAl (MaDbRiT)",
