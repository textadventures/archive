Game runs out there!&quot; \n\n[b:2gms97l5]Descriptive Level[/b:2gms97l5]\nDescriptions were a little more verbose than most Quest games, but only a little. The game might go from a reasonably decent (by the standards of the last few Quest games I've played anyway) location description such as \n\nYOU ARE IN A NARROW TUNNEL.\nTHERE IS A POINTY STICK HERE.\nYOU CAN GO EAST, WEST, UP OR DOWN.\nTHERE IS A FAINT SMELL OF GOBLIN HERE.  THE TUNNEL SLOPES UP TO THE EAST, WHERE THERE IS A SMALL GLIMMER OF LIGHT, AND DOWN TO THE WEST, WHERE IT GETS DIMMER.\n\nto something like:\n\nYOU ARE IN A CAVE ENTRANCE, BY A SWAMP.\nTHERE IS A FEARLESS DRAGON-SLAYER AND A CAMPFIRE HERE.\nYOU CAN GO EAST, WEST OR DOWN.\n\nNow the first makes an effort to add a bit of depth to the game (and succeeds), the second doesnâ€™t. \n\nSpelling and grammar-wise, the game has few faults. The writing isn't especially polished and only rarely has any real effort been expended to make it any more readable, but there's nothing especially horrible here.\n\n[b:2gms97l5]Plot[/b:2gms97l5]\nSparse. In the extreme. You're a goblin, you're in a cave and you're hungry. Thatâ€™s it. You wander from place to place, finding food, eating it, and then hunting for some more.\n\nItâ€™s possible to die regularly. The hunger factor (an unpopular theme in IF precisely because itâ€™s such a pain) kicks in after a while and kills you off if you haven't eaten anything. Unfortunately, the game doesnâ€™t actually tell you this is going to happen beforehand, so itâ€™s likely you'll need to die to discover it. If you're going to kill the player off, particularly in a game written with a system that doesnâ€™t have an UNDO command, you ought to warn the player beforehand that it could happen. Eat food and your hunger timer decreases a little, giving you a bit more time to find some more food, although itâ€™s kind of strange seeing my little goblin drop dead of hunger two minutes after heâ€™s stuffed himself on some venison.\n\n[b:2gms97l5]Interaction[/b:2gms97l5]\nBetter than average for a Quest game. There were a few honest to god puzzles here in relation to some of the objects, and I even managed to use a few of them to perform simple tasks. On the negative side, the game uses the same kind of bizarre wording that seems prevalent in Quest games. If you're carrying, say, a stick and need to pick up, say, some venison with it, you canâ€™t type the simple and straightforward GET VENISON WITH STICK but instead USE STICK ON VENISON. Still, as this is the kind of thing I've come across in more than a few games before (Quest games and otherwise), it didnâ€™t require too much of an effort to figure out what I needed to do.\n\nAnother refreshing thing, and so rare in Quest games in general, is that items and NPCs donâ€™t necessarily need to be referred to by their full name to be recognised. So the fearless dragon-slayer can be referred to as slayer and will still be recognised. I wish a few more authors did this.\n\n[b:2gms97l5]Stability[/b:2gms97l5]\nThe game didnâ€™t crash on me (thankfully) and I didnâ€™t run into anything that was [i:2gms97l5]definitely[/i:2gms97l5] a bug, although the hunger timer certainly needed some work. A proper timer shouldnâ€™t increase itself when a typo is entered, or when you're saving or loading the game.\n\n[b:2gms97l5]Originality[/b:2gms97l5]\nWell, I've never before played a game where I was a goblin who needed to eat every few minutes or die of hunger, so in that sense the game was original indeed. At the same time, it wasnâ€™t a particularly good idea, and after dying a dozen times in almost as many minutes from hunger, the novelty was beginning to wear mighty thin.\n\n[b:2gms97l5]Overall[/b:2gms97l5]\nAn amusing little, albeit frustrating, game if you have five minutes to spare.

I think you'll find they're light years better than this game.<br/><br/>The point I'm trying to get across is that I can't see how this game can possibly be rated 4 out of 5 on any proper scale. Granted, it's one of the better Quest games I've played but there are so many things wrong with it, I think I was generous with my 3 out of 10 rating.<br/><br/>I hate to ask this but you're not just giving the game a high rating to encourage people to use Quest and check out its games?",
