The user interface is a web browser, so more or less the same as Quest, with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\r\n\r\nI had a look at how a strategy game might be done in Quest, and came up with this interface:\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ohqyc_lfuuiqjsuwmvbkbw/star-empire-v0-1\r\n\r\nClick on stars and planets, and look at the star map. The star map is created in Quest using SVG, and you can click on the arrows at the sides to move, zoom in to see star names displayed, and click on a star to see data on that star.\r\n\r\nIt is not simple, but is doable (could be done in Twine too, pretty much the same, I would guess).",

My suggestion that the new forum should have the same features as the old forum and which other forums had was dismissed out of hand with a simple \"just because other places have them is no reason to have them here\" without even entering into a proper discussion about why it might be a good idea to have those features. Until such time as someone manages to convince him otherwise - and good luck with that, he's nothing if not stubborn - I don't see things improving.",
