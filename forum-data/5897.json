Having the player &quot;cradle&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; the person is just a weird way of putting it, so I just wanted to use &quot;hug&quot;. I try to enter in new verb, and a table underneath gives me the four verbs I gave to the cat. However, I just want &quot;hug&quot;. I've tried not clicking on it, putting in a space, whatever, but it won't let me isolate one of the verbs.\nI know that they won't all show up with the hyperlink, but it's annoying me to no end.\n\nThis wouldn't be a big deal, except that this is not the only time this has happened: I have grouped other verbs together that [i:3vhl6tvs]need[/i:3vhl6tvs] to be separated for a different object.\nIt seems like once I group verbs together, they can't be separated. Is there a way to fix this, or should I just put &quot;hug&quot; in as a command?",
