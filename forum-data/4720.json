Choosing a base font in [i:1rottzn8]Quest[/i:1rottzn8] is a form of drudgery.\n\nAs currently implemented, [i:1rottzn8]Quest[/i:1rottzn8] programmers must select a base font, write a little game that includes a &quot;Print a message&quot; script to display the selected base font, play the game to see the selected base font, then repeat the cycle multiple times until a final base font is chosen.  Drudgery.\n\nWhy doesn't the &quot;Base font&quot; drop-down list on the game / Display tab include samples of each font?  Microsoft Word does for font selection.  Paint.NET does.  Most contemporary software does...except [i:1rottzn8]Quest[/i:1rottzn8].\n\n2. Choosing a background or foreground colour in [i:1rottzn8]Quest[/i:1rottzn8] is a form of ludicrous drudgery.\n\nAs currently implemented, [i:1rottzn8]Quest[/i:1rottzn8] programmers must select from a list of colour [i:1rottzn8]names[/i:1rottzn8].  Colour names?#@!  The names are either inaccurate (e.g. LightGray sure isn't &quot;light&quot; to me) or meaningless (e.g. how any people on the face of the Earth intuitively know the hue &quot;HoneyDew&quot;?).  Then, write a little game, play the little game, repeat the cycle multiple times. Ugh.\n\nWhy don't &quot;Background colour&quot; and &quot;Foreground&quot; on the game / Display tab give us a palette for colour selection?  (Again, see Microsoft Word, Paint.NET, and most contemporary software for examples.)  Geez, the code doesn't even need to be written;  just grab a library that includes a color palette class.\n\nA list of colour [i:1rottzn8]names[/i:1rottzn8]?#@!  Ludicrous.",

      "EditableText": "To answer your first question (somewhat), Word shows the fonts available *on your system*. Such programs use a common control built into Windows to show such fonts, which is why the use of that mode of selection is so prevalent. Quest is a different matter. Besides the standard stock fonts (which I suppose could be displayed), the vast majority of fonts available to Quest are Google fonts, which are not available in programs like Word. So until there is such a common control for Google fonts, with widespread implementations in programs of such *off-system* fonts, you're comparing apples and oranges (they're both fonty fruit, but of a different kind. One shows what's in your fridge, and the other shows what's at the store).\n\nAnd the Google fonts website provides a much more in-depth, accessible and worthwhile way to browse the fonts. You do have to make an additional click or two, but... as they say, why re-invent the wheel when this is all being done by volunteers on a part-time basis?\n\nIf you do find deficiencies in Quest that you would like addressed, feel free to put in a feature request - or better yet, roll up your sleeves and contribute the code yourself!",
