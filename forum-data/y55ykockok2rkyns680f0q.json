      "EditableText": "Hello, everyone. I have a small design problem that I was hoping the community could help me with. Basically, I am writing a gamebook using Quest, and I want certain choices to only be visible to the player (and only be selectable) if certain pre-existing conditions that will be set up through variables and such are met. So, for example, an option to buy something in a store showing up only if the player had sufficient money to purchase the item. Is there a way to do this? If so, can someone enlighten me as to how this might be achieved? Thanks a lot in advance for any help with this topic!",
