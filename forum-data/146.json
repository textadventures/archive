I'm thinking it would only need to go to two decimal spaces, I can't really imagine needing anything more than that ever, though there is the ideal of, if you are going to do something do it right, and it may make more sense to just have a fully functional \"calculator\" built in. \n\nAlso, it might be nice if it had it's own syntax or something, though at this point I'm not really sure how to do it well. I'd say a function, ie; $math(4+2/3*8)$ but then there may be complications(perhaps it could have  a built in feature to go by PEMDAS) but this also brings the problem of not being able to invoke other functions inside of it.\n\nI don't know, just a suggestion.",
