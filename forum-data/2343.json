      "EditableText": "Hey,\n\n If I'm reading this correctly I might know the answer to your question. You want to create a stand alone file (.exe) from a CAS file right? You should be able to that that using the Quest Packager. You can also skip the step of creating the CAS file if you want, and make a package directly from choosing your ASL file. Once it's packaged it's going to be .exe either way, so people wont be able to &quot;open&quot; it in the QDK editor. Hope this helps. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

I know it will include them in the package, but I don't know how it will effect game-play/loading. In the game I'm currently coding I can say that using the .wav format comes in handy as it can be looped (for BG music), but not so much when packaging it as a stand alone .exe. The game takes uber long to load and then crashes.. hopefully Alex will remedy this somehow.",
