They were one of the early pull requests I received, so not my idea, but it sounded reasonable enough. The idea is that you could &quot;look north&quot;, &quot;look south&quot; etc.\n\nBut surely you can do that by just adding those as commands - &quot;look north&quot; and &quot;look n&quot; would cover it, I think. You could define these globally as a fallback so you could have some default &quot;There's nothing interesting in that direction&quot; text or whatever.\n\nSo I don't think this is a feature that is needed by the core library - it complicates and overloads what an exit &quot;is&quot;, which seems too big a cost for the value this feature adds.\n\nAny objections if this feature doesn't make it into QuestKit? Have I missed something useful about how this currently works in Quest?",

Having a &quot;look only&quot; exit seemed to be the solution.  I created a look only exit, with name &quot;window&quot;.  Confusingly the destination of the exit disappears when you assign the &quot;look only&quot; attribute.  In fact it turned out to be a real pain.  As soon as an exit is &quot;look only&quot; it disappears from all listings, and the only way to interact with it is to manage to type the correct command &quot;look south&quot; or whatever.  You can't &quot;look window&quot; or &quot;look at|through|in window&quot;.  \n\nI have been using the text processor extensively in my game (yay text processor!) and plan to eschew the GUI compass completely relying on hyperlinks.  So to deal with the obscure &quot;look south&quot; command issue I did:  &quot;In the south wall is a {command:look south:window} facing the farm&quot;.  But the pain does not stop there: you'd be forgiven for thinking that you'd get a description of the room for free when you look south.  Instead you have to write a script or text - and the script has to do something like iterate over ScopeVisibleNotHeldForRoom.  I got all that working in the end, but it took quite a bit of code.\n\nSo in short, &quot;look only&quot; exits as they are now are so painful I can't imagine anyone wanting to use them.  Its probably a good idea to get rid of them and create a help page that describes how to implement that with a script.",
