      "EditableText": "Alex said we could start threads if we had ideas for things to add to QuestKit, but also that there wouldn't be a lot of new additions.  With that in mind, one feature -- common to IF, but absent from Quest -- strikes me as enough of a priority to at least open up a discussion: the ability to tell NPCs to do things.\n\nThis usually comes in the form of &quot;Bob, wash car&quot; or something like that, (less commonly it'll have an actual command, like &quot;tell Bob to wash car&quot;), but there's no real mechanism to do this easily in Quest.  The best way I've seen is to co-opt &quot;tell about&quot; into &quot;tell to&quot;, but this leaves a lot to be desired, mostly because the &quot;ask/tell&quot; system works by identifying key words rather than objects (in this case, a car) to be acted upon.\n\nTwo possible ways it could work:\n\nFrom the NPC end- Add a new feature type for objects that accept orders, with a tab where you can pair verbs to objects and assign behaviors to them.\n\nFrom the target object end- Add a fourth option to the verbs tab, &quot;perform by other character&quot;, which would work just as &quot;require another object&quot; does, but would be populated by other characters who can be made to perform the action (including the player character themself).\n\nThese are just suggestions.  I don't know which of these would be easier to program, or which would be easier for people to use.  I can see pros and cons to each, and maybe neither is the right answer, but it's a commonly used IF feature that Quest really ought to have built into it somehow.\n\nThoughts?",
