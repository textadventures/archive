I just had to rearrange the placement of my commands. \r\n\r\nI realize there is a volume option and you could set small containers to a volume of 1, medium to a 5, and large as a 100, but then you would need to assign volumes to every object the player can pick up.  Oh, elephant > 5, then \"it won't fit in there.\"\r\n\r\nI also realize you could probably assign an attribute to every object - small, medium, large, and... If object has 'small' attribute, then it can be put in any container, medium attribute can fit in medium/large container, etc...  And, I believe there is an option under limited container to only allow so many objects in said container.  That way you can't put 100 small objects in small container.\r\n\r\nAnyway, **for now** the current problem with containers seems to be solved.  \r\n\r\n... It amazes me how picky I'm getting with certain things as I delve into my third big game.  In game one, I was sooo very lenient on scripting.  Game two, I thought I tightened the screws about as much as they could tighten, and now... well, I'm getting nit-picky about everything!  Not sure if that is a sign of quality game making or just a severe case of OCD.  lol\r\n\r\nThanks a ton for your help!",
