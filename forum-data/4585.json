      "EditableText": "Hey Jay, thanks for the response.  Sorry for not providing more information.  That's super helpful with the HandleCommand bit.  I'll take a more specific look at it.  In regards to the capitalization, actually what I want to do IS to capitalize the verb.  The issue is that it seems to automatically lowercase it.  I have yet decided if I want to get rid of the &quot;&gt;&quot; or not.  I might leave it but I'll bold the whole line also.  But thanks to you I know how to do that now.  If you have any ideas on the capitalization issue that would be extremely helpful.  Thanks again so much!\n\nCheers!",
