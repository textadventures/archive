She has got some bad advice along the way and she's done a fair amount of backsliding too.  \n\nThe whole idea about being in the public eye like Britney is that they  need to balance the tone of their lives  somewhere between a church and a bowling alley.  Too much either way and they either begin to become smug and sanctimonious like Tom Cruise or trashy and crude like Li'l Kim.  I'm afraid that Britney is standing dangerously close to the door to the bowling alley.",
