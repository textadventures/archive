So I made a short gamebook and I want to put it on my website, but I don't want my users to need to download anything...so I read the documentation and according to it: \n\n[quote:15pbloqq]This will take your game file together with all included libraries, and package it up with all the picture and sound files in your game folder. The result will be one .quest file that contains everything your game needs to run. You can then upload this file to textadventures.co.uk, which will mean other people can play your game online in their web browser - without having to download any software.\n[/quote:15pbloqq]\n\nSo the only way to get my game working without needing to download software is to upload it to the website? \n\nWhat if I want to constantly update my game, will it be a problem?",
