Press “End” keyboard button to scroll down faster.)\r\n\r\n3. https://www.google.com/ (Or any search engine that you prefer.)\r\n\r\n4. https://copilot.microsoft.com/ (Or any AI that you prefer, find out some tricks from Ip man at https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/general/topic/tbsjgi8zhesexc1fv05v-w/copilot-and-quest )\r\n\r\n5. https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/ (I heard other people are also building their own libraries but I dunno where they are.)\r\n\r\n6. Offline quest app (It might have more functionalities than online quest app.)\r\n\r\n7. Quest app attributes tab (Almost every single object, room, game, player have attributes, you can easily create a customized code from that like ice cream.visible = false and possibly paste it at code view of entering specific room or game’s scripts tab’s Scripts when entering a new room.)\r\n\r\n8. Press play Quest, click html tools, “Cough… if you dun understand code like me, you simply scroll through all codes by pressing down and right buttons until the game screen highlights the User Interface that you want to modify, then on the right hand side, there are styles tab, then you will have to copy the keywords that you want to modify and paste into your game as a Javascript code. ” (An example is JS.setCss (\"#gameBorder\", \"margin-left: 0px\") from https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/_5fm70vcreejxifcp1tryw/width-and-position-of-page)\r\n\r\n9. If you need further advanced customization of the user interface, you are in deep funny situation. Use https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_scrollbar.asp A successful example is at https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/jue4u7tdj06fgq4ap5n53q/trying-to-change-the-inventory-pane But yeah, I dun understand how to use this website as well.\r\n\r\n10. If all of the above does not solve your coding problems, it simply means a solution have not been created or asked yet, you can definitely ask in https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest Or perhaps, you dun have that much time to search through so many links or steps for your problem, just ask in the forum, the other coders are so advanced, they can probably just write the answer on the spot.\r\n\r\n11. If you have not been receiving help in the forums, the code you need might be hidden inside quest app, learn overriding functions at https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Overriding-Functions to unlock and modify any of the built in functions. As complicated as it sounds, it is simply creating another function with the same name, then you copy and paste over the function’s code inside code view and modify the areas you want to change. Before you change a function, you need to guess what function you need to be changing, it will save you some time by clicking already written function definitions at https://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/ A successful example is at https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/2ozazescok_qifwb4d4a4g/any-way-to-change-the-color-of-the-dot-on-the-map-that-represents-the-players-lo\r\n\r\n12. How to install library or even create your own libraries? The answer is at https://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/using_libraries.html\r\n\r\n13. How the hack do I play parser-based games? An example game with a complete hint system is at https://blog.textadventures.co.uk/2020/09/22/a-tutorial-for-playing-parser-base-games/\r\n\r\n14. My game is crashing. A solved crashing game example is at https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/2ejapyv8be_uwd8hphvffg/game-crashing-when-i-try-to-run-it But basically (1. Make a good habit of saving backup copies of your game, so if you messed up with something complicated, you can just go back to a previous backup game. 2. Reduce the size of your game file like pictures, music, youtube links. 3. Verify the integrity of the codes that trigger at game startup. 4. Delete complicated functions or codes until the game crashing stops, remember to make a backup game copy! 5. Understand what lags the game, 20 timers is laggier than 100 different codes that triggers on entering 100 different rooms. Because the coding of 20 timers runs all the time while 1 different code only trigger one time when entering 1 different room. Mrangel also explained that infinite loops and recursion can cause a crashing game. Obviously this is a more intricate topic, so you will need to ask on the forum if you are not sure if something or some codes is lagging your quest app.)\r\n\r\n15. How do I write spoilers or block quotation in forum? Full answer is at https://docs.textadventures.co.uk/forum/\r\n\r\n16. The forum is blocking my topic posting because it is too long. Most likely you are trying to paste your whole game code. A working example is https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/g4wdchoonkicauyfzjryww/k03-free-game-code-templates-2024 Use https://gist.github.com/ or whatever coding pasting website you are more comfortable with and paste the link into the forum.\r\n\r\n17. How do I paste a picture in forum? One possible answer is https://imgbb.com/ I do not know the alternatives.\r\n\r\n18. I want a game cover art, but I cannot draw. I recommend AI art like microsoft pilot because it is free, more techniques on how to use it is at https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/general/topic/pzxsb929x0kjs_t0qtghhg/free-game-cover-art-via-copilot But of course, if you want more quality art, you can buy 2d art assets from game creation companies, they usually have a marketplace website for that, but beware, the price is… staggering.\r\n\r\n19. Why is my game not categorized? The full explanation is at https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/games/topic/m3t_r00w5kii7qjn66cwgq/who-bothers-to-categorise-new-games The short explanation is the moderators are busy and working for free, they will probably categorize games a few times per year. Cough… I have two trojan horse games to test how strict the game approval is. https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/RWkq9yp__kiObD4RVxVMRw/asdfghjkl-2021 This game have a strange name and horrible game story but it was aprroved. https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ODLtp2PsSE6lBJ_MpS2gKg/explore-vore-sculpture-gallery-with-shrinking-furry-and-its-best-friend-a-real-c This have a state of the art gameplay, the best walkaround coding that I have with full-fledged story from start to end, but the game title is… outstanding. Thus, from this 2 trojan horse games, you can understand that the game approval rate is actually not strict at all as long as you make your “presentation” of the game is not degrading to the reputation of the website itself, whereas the content itself is more up to your creativeness and individuality, but of course, players might leave a scarring review as everyone’s personality is different.\r\n\r\n20. Too long didn’t read: Easy, you do not have to read all of this, press control + f (keyboard buttons), and type in some keywords from your particular question, press the down arrow button until you find relevant solutions.",
