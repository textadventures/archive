For example, Bilbo has 3 apples in his possession. The server is shut down, and work is done on the .ASL file. The server is brought back up with the new ASL file. Those 3 apples will be returned to their original placement in the world, no? Am I missing something here?\n\nI understand how to save player's inventories -- but this is another matter entirely.",
