      "EditableText": "> It generates a map with just one path from entrance to exit.\r\n\r\n<!-- That's relatively easy to do.\r\nOne method is to make a grid of rooms first (can be a complete grid, or some other pattern), and give them descriptions/contents/etc. If you're doing something more complex than just a square grid, it might be worth making invisible exits for all the possible directions.\r\nThen make a list of 'connected' rooms, consisting of just the starting room.\r\n* while (connected rooms < all rooms) {\r\n  * make a list of possible exits from a connected room to a non-connected room\r\n  * pick one possible exit from that list, and create it\r\n  * add the destination of that exit to the list of connected rooms\r\n* }\r\n* If you used invisible exits to represent places where there could be an exit, it's a good time to delete the unused ones.\r\n\r\nThis generates a maze where all rooms are connected, but there are no alternate routes. So if you have things like some doors requiring keys, you apply the lock to an exit created after the room containing the key is connected.\r\n\r\nIf you want certain obstacles to be encountered in a certain order, then you could give a newly-connected room a certain % chance of having the next obstacle from the list copied into it. If you want to allow loops and alternate paths, but force the player to pass through those 'significant' rooms as a bottleneck, then instead of a list of connected rooms, you'd have separate lists of rooms connected since the last bottleneck, and rooms connected before that. And filter your possible exits to choose ones that connect an exit on the recently-connected list, to an exit that is not on the previously-connected list. -->\r\n\r\nEdit: Sorry, thought my thoughts might be helpful",
