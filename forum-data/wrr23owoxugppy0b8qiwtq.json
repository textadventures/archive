Honestly, it sounds awesome, all hail king javascript,  but it still seems a ways off, plus the dearth of activity in that area makes me worried that it's stalled somehow.\r\n\r\nSo, is it safe to start working on a project with Quest 5 with the expectation that it will eventually be portable to Quest 6 and made web-deployable?  Would Quest 6 be backwards compatible?  Or should I just bite the bullet and figure out the server code?",
