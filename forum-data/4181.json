There is something I am trying to do in the gamebook I am writing, but I am not sure if it is possible.\n\nI can get the random text option to work fine, but I am wondering if it is possible to link a picture to each different text possibility. That is, if random text A is displayed, then picture A is displayed, but if random text B is displayed, then picture B is displayed. \n\nI attempted to &quot;nest&quot; the {img} command in the random text command, but that didn't work. Is there a way to make this work or is it simply not doable?\n\nThanks!\n\nJMC",
