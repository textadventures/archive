      "EditableText": "You can't combine objects really (well, you can put objects inside each other, but in this case you probably want to treat the &quot;tube and bung&quot; as one object). So, you have two options:\n\n1. Swap objects around. Have &quot;tube without bung&quot; and &quot;tube with bung&quot; as two separate objects, and move them when required\n2. Modify the object. You can change any object attribute with a script, so you could change the alias of the tube, set a flag etc. Your scripts can check for the presence of the object flag to determine what happens.",
