It has its parameters by default, but in some room i want modify it a bit. So can i somehow create a object template, use it as default in some rooms without adding it as new object for each of them?\r\n\r\nAs its clear, mostly there is hundreds of dungeon style fight scripts available, just cant find one :-/\r\n\r\nSo is there a coding snippet or library i could study to make some fights on my planned game?\r\n\r\nThanks, Ek",
