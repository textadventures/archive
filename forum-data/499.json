However, I have found four other files which have the extension of .vbz, two of which are the add-ins that I listed above.  If I double-click on them, they open up a new VB window (despite the fact that I already have one open) and then tell me that I need an open project to run the wizard.  Are vbz files VB Add-ins and if so, where do I put these files, or how do I run these wizards stand-alone.\n\n[EDIT]: Just got a new question: How do you load all fonts that are on the computer into a combobox, and does the normal textbox control support different fonts and sizes at one time (like Word does), or do I have to use the RichTextBox Control?\n\n[EDIT 2]Sorry, more questions:  How do you make a custom right-click context menu?",
