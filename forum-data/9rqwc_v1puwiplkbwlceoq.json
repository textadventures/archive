I think it may be because the attribute \"wear_slots\" is a string list and this causes some sort of error. Why is this happening? How could I solve this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and happy gaming :)\r\n\r\n(Sorry I don't know why this was posted twice)",

So the second line would find all worn items for which their `wear_stols` attribute is the string `\"armadis\"`.\r\n\r\nI believe `wear_slots` is a stringlist, so can't be equal to a string. To do this, you'd want to loop over the list yourself and find the matching elements.
