But here's something that I thought about off the top of my head:\r\n```\r\n  <function name=\"AddStatusAttributesForElement\" parameters=\"status, element, statusAttributes\" type=\"string\">\r\n    if (not statusAttributes = null) {\r\n      params = NewDictionary()\r\n      foreach (attr, GetAttributeNames (element, true)) {\r\n        dictionary add (params, attr, GetAttribute (element, attr))\r\n      }\r\n      foreach (attr, statusAttributes) {\r\n        list add (status, FormatStatusAttribute(attr, eval (attr, params), StringDictionaryItem(statusAttributes, attr)))\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  </function>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, for the key of the statusattributes dictionary, it doesn't have to be just an attribute name. You could have something like `currenthp + \"/\" + maxhp` as the variable name for a status attribute, or even have status attributes tied to function calls rather than attributes.",
