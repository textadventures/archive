So, this will have to wait until a bigger overhaul of ASL.\n\nNot sure what you mean by the string comparison - if it's just whitespace that's the problem then you can always do &quot;if ( .#blah#. = .#something#. ) ...&quot;. Not pleasant but it should work.\n\nBasically none of Quest's features are written in ASL, except if you're using net.lib or stdverbs.lib.\n\nEverything else is VB6, of varying degrees of whackiness.

You can't nest expressions within brackets, and there's no point in overhauling the &quot;if&quot; statement if it can't do brackets as well. So, this will have to wait until a bigger overhaul of ASL.<br/><br/>Not sure what you mean by the string comparison - if it's just whitespace that's the problem then you can always do &quot;if ( .#blah#. = .#something#. ) ...&quot;. Not pleasant but it should work.<br/><br/>Basically none of Quest's features are written in ASL, except if you're using net.lib or stdverbs.lib.<br/><br/>Everything else is VB6, of varying degrees of whackiness. (Yes, I was 16 years old when I started Quest, and some of that code lingers and makes me want to cry)",
