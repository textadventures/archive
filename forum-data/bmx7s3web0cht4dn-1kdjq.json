      "EditableText": "Hello fellow text-adventure enthusiasts!\r\n\r\nApologies for my first post on the forums being a plug but I recently released an Android based text adventure app on the Play store. It's a 1950's noir thriller set in New York. The interface is an old-school 'type what you want to do' affair rather than a 'pick a path' adventure. \r\n\r\nI used to love text-based adventure games growing up and half the fun for me was discovering how to do what you want to do rather than the current gaming trend of hand-holding a player through the game. As a consequence, the feedback I've received so far is that it's too difficult.\r\n\r\nI admit, it is challenging but every puzzle is logical and has clues . You just need to find them.\r\n\r\nBTW, although it's set in New York, I'm English, so it understands the way words are really spelt as well as the American equivalents ;o)\r\n\r\nSo, if you're looking for a game that you have to think about and can't solve in 20 minutes, I think you might enjoy it. \r\n\r\nlink: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/1CSU23\">Betsy Sykes Mysteries</a>\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear how people get on and, if possible, get the odd review on the play store. At the moment, I don't have enough reviews for it to be seen by anyone that doesn't know the exact name of the game!\r\n\r\nMany thanks & happy adventuring,\r\nMark Rigby",

      "EditableText": "Brilliant! \r\n\r\nMany thanks, R2T1. Sometimes you can be too close to a project to notice things like that.\r\n\r\nA new update has been rolled out a few minutes ago..\r\n\r\nIncluded - Location name in the description box, shortcuts x,l,i added as well as g(et) and r(ead). I wanted to add 'u' for use but it's already being used for 'up'. I can get round that but it's a little more time consuming so it'll be coming soon. Oh, also you can now use 'g a' as a shortcut for 'get all', which will pick up all objects in a location. Saves having to type in the names of the objects and suffering more spelling woes.\r\n\r\nTotally take your point about the pictures. To be honest, they were added firstly for a bit of atmosphere and secondly as a cosmetic device to fill the space when the keyboard isn't on screen. Frankly, I made a rod for my own back setting it in the 1950's - as this is my first release, I used only free-to-use stock photos. That greatly reduces your options normally, but set the game that far back and, boy, do you have to dig around to find anything useful!\r\n\r\nAlso get your point about items mentioned that you can't interact with. I've updated for the desk and filing cabinet in the office and will be rolling out more items in time. Again, this is quite time consuming.\r\n\r\nThank you for noticing the automatic 'save' system - That took quite some time to work out so I appreciate you noticing it!\r\n\r\noh, and the 2 reviews on Play were from my sister and nephew - they were just being encouraging. Frankly, I don't think they've even played the game.\r\n\r\nMany thanks, and I hope the updates will encourage you to keep playing.\r\n\r\nMark",
