      "EditableText": "Ewww.  =)  I would make the door NOT a container.  Make the door an object and just put the open verb and close verb on the door (and door1) and place a flag named 'ajar' on both 'door' and 'door1' when you open it.  If necessary, you would also place an unlock (open) exit or lock (close) exit on each door object.  Use an 'If' 'flag' combo in the description box for both 'door' and 'door1' and remove the flag for the close verb for both doors.\r\n\r\nI assume both doors are actually the SAME door, right?\r\n\r\nI do this method a lot when I have the 'same' visible door in different rooms.",
