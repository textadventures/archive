But I can't remember if I'm doing a gamebook or text adventure, and I'm not sure how to check! Yeah...like I said, I have a LOT to learn. Help please?",

In time, after you understand the possibilities of Quest, you will find there are ways to create a Gamebook using the Text Adventure mode, what opens certain funtions, like allowing you using more complex scripts, or just managing inventory. I am working on something like that righ now: a Gamebook using the Text Adventure mode. \r\n\r\nBut until you get comfortable with Quest and the making of Interactive Fiction, perhaps it is better you stick to what you need. Actually, my recomendation is forgetting about Quest for now and focusing of the word processor (Like Microsoft Word) and a branching tool (Like ChatMapper) and work on your story, tracking branching and taking notes of everything you would possibly need. After it is done, you worry about how placing it all in Quest. If not, you will have a creative block, focusing on things you don't really need right now.",
