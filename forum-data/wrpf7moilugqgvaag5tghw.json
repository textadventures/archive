Now it is happening again.\r\n\r\nI only need to fix a dozen or so exits because of it, however until the issue stops occurring I cannot even do that. The game just does not save the alias name I type in, and so when I return to the interface after leaving it is just blank. Regardless of how many times I retype it in.",
