The game is.......The Sims 2!!!! I recommend it for everyone. In fact, to tell you the truth, I haven't even been playing the actual game. It has an in game feature that you can make movies...meaning that you can record your sims. So you can create a storyline and set the scene and tone, and then download a code to make your sims react emotionally how you want them to, and then shoot it. You get to experiment with really cool camera angles, and use a lot of creativity. Even if you haven't played the sims 1, I think you will love it. Though you will probably appreciate all the additions to the game more if you have played the first one. Anyway, just thought I'd share my opinion of a great game.   \n\nP.S. I will probably start again on quest soon.....I can't keep away from it <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
