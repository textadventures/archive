      "EditableText": "Hi. I also have copies of the Usborne books - The Mystery of Silver Mountain, The Island of Secrets, and a few others. Back in 2003, I translated Island of secrets to Inform 6 but never published it to the wider community due to worries about copyright, etc although I did acknowledge the original authors and publisher in the opening of the game.\n\nI have started using this as my test case to build something in Quest 5.2 and have so far added a few of the rooms and descriptions. It is slow going as I am scouring the tutorial &amp; forums for 'how to' stuff. I must say, I am finding Quest to be quite easy to use.\n \nI have added a lot of embellishment to the descriptions based on what I saw in the book's drawings. I've also created a map in Excel (saved as PDF) I have attached the z5 file here if you would like to play the game to see how it works. (enjoy)\n\nPS. As I am not creative when it comes to writing from scratch, I find enjoyment from translating code into other languages. I did this a lot back in the '80s when computer magazines were full of listings but not for my Exidy Sorcerer. \n\nIf you think I should load this to the IF archives, I'll include the other material with it including the source file.\n\nPPS. I have downloaded Mystery of Silver Mountain here and will play it alongside the book to compare.",
