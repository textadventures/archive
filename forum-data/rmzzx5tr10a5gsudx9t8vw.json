      "EditableText": "I'm trying out a new, live text chat/text app.  It's called Discord.  It's pretty nice and easy to use.  I thought maybe if anyone wanted to stop by and chat about Quest, text adventures, or really just life in general, the invitation is open!   Also, if anyone is seeking step-by-step help solving a problem with Quest, this also might prove pretty useful.  The forum is great, but sometimes it's a little easier to give/receive clearer instruction in real time as opposed to hoping a forum post makes sense.\r\n\r\nDiscord is different to many chat/text rooms in that you do not need to keep the app open to see the message board.  Anything posted in the community forum can be viewed by anyone even if they just logged in.  So, be careful what you say (you can delete/edit your posts, too)!  It's also very easy to PM people if you don't want to bog down the main forum.  This is a nice little PM replacement until Alex has time to reinstate the PM option in the Quest Forums.\r\n\r\nI always leave it open on my computer (I just change my name to XanMag - AFK when I'm away).  Most of you are \"English-types\" so my correspondence time is limited to about 6-11 EST, which I believe is about 5-6 hours behind you all.  Discord is a nice, little break to all this crazy school prep stuff I have to do this year.  To get started, download Discord and use this link to jump right in --  **https://d-i-s-c-o-r-d.gg/vevXE** Remove the hyphens in discord first.\r\n\r\nHope to see you there!  Happy gaming!\r\n\r\nXanMag",
