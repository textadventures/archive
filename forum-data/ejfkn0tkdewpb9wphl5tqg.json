      "EditableText": "I'd suggest something like KV's answer. However, I'm thinking that if the item is consumable, you could get odd errors (trying to clone an object that's been destroyed). I'd change the 'take' script to something like:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"You pluck the fart blossom from the branch.\")\r\nnewblossom = CloneObjectAndMove (this, game.pov)\r\nnewblossom.take = true\r\nthis.visible = false\r\nSetTurnTimeout (6) {\r\n  fart blossom.visible = true\r\n  if (game.pov.parent = fart blossom.parent) {\r\n    msg (\"A new fart blossom blossoms.\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis puts a clone in your inventory, and makes the original invisible for 6 turns (including this one). It also can be used in cases where the branch is strong enough to put items on. KV's version checks if the blossom is on the branch in order to decide whether to clone it or pick it up normally. Mine just sets `newblossom.take = true`, which removes this script from the clone and causes it to follow the default item-that-can-be-taken behaviour.\r\n\r\n(I'm using this method in my woodlands; except the cloned object isn't always the same. I've got an object for a flower growing in the ground, but its take script gives you a clone of a picked_flower, with a different description because it's been picked)",

      "EditableText": "I think that the easiest way to do it if you want to have multiple plants, and have all of them respawn an item after some number of turns, then the easiest way is going to be having a factory object. This could be a bush that regrows leaves, or it could be an invisible object.\r\n\r\nFor an example, I'll give you a bush that regrows flowers.\r\n\r\nThe bush's initialisation script [I'm using the web version. If you're on desktop, you could probably do this more easily in the attributes tab]:\r\n```\r\nthis.regrows_after_turns = 15\r\nthis.hasflower = true\r\nthis.regrow => {\r\n  this.hasflower = true\r\n  this.look = \"It's a bush, with a red flower growing on it\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd the bush's \"take\" script:\r\n```\r\nif (this.hasflower) {\r\n  msg (\"You pick a flower from the bush\")\r\n  this.look = \"It's a bush, but you picked the flower now\"\r\n  this.hasflower = false\r\n  this.turns_since_picked = 0\r\n  AddToInventory (CloneObject (red flower))\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"There's no flower to pick. You might need to wait for another one to grow\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI'm assuming there is an object named \"red flower\"; the original is probably somewhere the player can't access, but it doesn't matter as long as it doesn't get destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd then to make this work, you have a turnscript. You can put this in a turnscript on its own, or include it within your existing time system, to be run every time a real turn has passed.\r\n```\r\nforeach (object, AllObjects()) {\r\n  if (HasInt(object, \"turns_since_picked\")) {\r\n    object.turns_since_picked = object.turns_since_picked + 1\r\n    if (object.turns_since_picked = object.regrows_after_turns) {\r\n      do (object, \"regrow\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen you have it; a bush that regrows after 15 turns. You can clone the bush in different rooms, and each one will keep its own timer to decide when to grow a new flower. You can use the same script on different bushes, and just change the type of flower grown.\r\n\r\nThen if you want some object (a stone on the ground, maybe?) that reappears without growing on a bush, you could add it like this. Its initialisation script:\r\n```\r\nthis.regrows_after_turns = 22\r\nthis.regrow => {\r\n  if (HasObject(this, \"original_location\")) {\r\n    newstone = CloneObjectAndMove (this, this.original_location)\r\n    newstone.turns_since_picked = null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd its 'take' script:\r\n```\r\nAddToInventory(this)\r\nmsg (\"You pick up the stone.\")\r\n\r\n// If it doesn't already have a turns_since_picked, this is the first time so we start counting\r\n// ... and remember its original_location so we know where to put the clone.\r\nif (not HasInt(this, \"turns_since_picked\")) {\r\n  this.turns_since_picked = 0\r\n  this.original_location = this.parent\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that's clear enough. From your posts, I think that should do everything you want. You just need one turnscript to keep it ticking over; and you can have as many bushes or stones as you need, or different types of items using the same script.",

      "EditableText": "Did you include the turnscript?\r\nThe first two scripts in that post were for a bush that grows flowers. The last two for an object that respawns itself. And the one in the middle is the Turnscript that powers both of them. You should be able to put that in a turnscript on its own, or you can incorporate it into your existing timing system if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe turnscript increases the \"turns_since_picked\" attribute of every object that has one; and if any of them have reached the same object's \"regrows_after_turns\" attribute, the objects \"regrow\" script is run.\r\n\r\n\r\n... yes, I made a dumb mistake.\r\nThe take script should be:\r\n```\r\nif (not HasInt(this, \"turns_since_picked\")) {\r\n  this.turns_since_picked = 0\r\n  this.original_location = this.parent\r\n}\r\nAddToInventory(this)\r\nmsg (\"You pick up the stone.\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis checks if the object already has a \"turns_since_picked\" attribute (in which case it's already been picked up).

It took me a long time to learn how to do damage and displaying it, and then to select/choose to attack, and/vs other actions, lol. Not easy to learn... and that's about as simple as you can get with combat design... lol.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n@ enpherdean:\r\n\r\nunfortunately, computers are stupid, you got to tell them exactly what to do... think of a computer as a very stupid child/baby, you got to hold its hand in-for getting it to do exactly what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nthe other big part (frustrating mess) of coding... is dealing (\"handling\") with the user's inputs...\r\n\r\nfor example,\r\n\r\nI can have 'type in your age', which is a simple enough action for the user to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Age?\")\r\nget input {\r\n  player.age = ToInt (result)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nunfortunately... users are either (or whatever combination) stupid, curious, and/or malignant.\r\n\r\nfor whatever the motive (stupidity, curiousness, malice), the user types in 'sdfneo'\r\n\r\nwhich unfortunately will cause an error because of the 'ToInt', as 'sdfneo' can't be converted into an Integer Data Type.\r\n\r\nthus, we have to code in \"handling the user/user's input\". (handling 'user input' is just one part of what is known as \"error and exception handling\") ... for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Age?\")\r\nget input {\r\n  if (IsInt) {\r\n    player.age = ToInt (result)\r\n  } else {\r\n    msg (\"ERROR: wrong input: You did NOT type in an Integer (a non-decimal number), which you must do so, please try again\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe're good now, right?\r\n\r\nwell... not neccesarily.... unfortunately...\r\n\r\nthe person could type in '-1', which would be a problem, as there's no such thing as a negative age (unless you want to count zygote to birth as negative age, lol), or they could type in '200', which, (in 2017) is impossible for a human to be that age, lol. for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Age?\")\r\nget input {\r\n  if (IsInt) {\r\n    input_integer_variable = ToInt (result)\r\n    if (input_integer_variable > 0 and input_integer_variable < 120) {\r\n      player.age = ToInt (result)\r\n    } else {\r\n      msg (\"ERROR: wrong input: You must enter a number (Integer: non-decimal number) between 0 and 120, please try again\")\r\n    }\r\n  } else {\r\n    msg (\"ERROR: wrong input: You did NOT type in an Integer (a non-decimal number), which you must do so, please try again\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow, we handled everything that's possible by user input, yay!\r\n\r\nthough, most stuff requires a lot more handling than just what I've shown with this example\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\na great way to store/save a specific clone as well as its origin (original object parent), is by using Attributes:\r\n\r\n1. an Attribute on/of the clone Object itself for storing its (reference/pointer of its) original object, so you have access to it\r\n2. an Attribute elsewhere to store that specific (reference/pointer of the) clone object, so you have access to it\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n1. (see below)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate (\"box\") // creating our original object\r\n\r\nclone_object_variable = CloneObject (box) // cloning our box, and temporarily storing its reference/pointer to it, into our local/temporary 'clone_object_variable' Variable VARIABLE\r\n\r\n// we do this because/so-that, we can now do this:\r\n\r\nclone_object_variable.original_object_pointer_object_attribute = box // we're storing the (reference/pointer of/to the) 'box' (original object) into our 'original_object_pointer_attribute' Object (reference/pointer) Attribute, on our specific (and just made) clone object\r\n\r\nmsg (\"The original Object of our clone, \" + clone_object_variable.name + \", is: \" + clone_object_variable.original_object_pointer_object_attribute.name)\r\n\r\n// output/result:\r\n\r\nThe original Object of our clone, box1, is: box\r\n\r\n// here it what our Objects look like, an example:\r\n\r\n<object name=\"box\">\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"box1\">\r\n  <attr name=\"original_object_pointer_object_attribute\" type=\"object\"box</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n// and let's say we've made more clones (looped/did-again the scripting, say, 2 more times):\r\n\r\n<object name=\"box\">\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"box1\">\r\n  <attr name=\"original_object_pointer_object_attribute\" type=\"object\"box</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"box2\">\r\n  <attr name=\"original_object_pointer_object_attribute\" type=\"object\"box</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"box3\">\r\n  <attr name=\"original_object_pointer_object_attribute\" type=\"object\"box</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n// results/output:\r\n\r\nThe original Object of our clone, box1, is: box\r\nThe original Object of our clone, box2, is: box\r\nThe original Object of our clone, box3, is: box\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n2.

It took me a long time to learn how to do damage and displaying it, and then to select/choose to attack, and/vs other actions, lol. Not easy to learn... and that's about as simple as you can get with combat design... lol.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>@ enpherdean:</p>\n<p>unfortunately, computers are stupid, you got to tell them exactly what to do... think of a computer as a very stupid child/baby, you got to hold its hand in-for getting it to do exactly what you want it to do.</p>\n<p>the other big part (frustrating mess) of coding... is dealing (\"handling\") with the user's inputs...</p>\n<p>for example,</p>\n<p>I can have 'type in your age', which is a simple enough action for the user to do:</p>\n<pre><code>msg (\"Age?\")\nget input {\n  player.age = ToInt (result)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>unfortunately... users are either (or whatever combination) stupid, curious, and/or malignant.</p>\n<p>for whatever the motive (stupidity, curiousness, malice), the user types in 'sdfneo'</p>\n<p>which unfortunately will cause an error because of the 'ToInt', as 'sdfneo' can't be converted into an Integer Data Type.</p>\n<p>thus, we have to code in \"handling the user/user's input\". (handling 'user input' is just one part of what is known as \"error and exception handling\") ... for example:</p>\n<pre><code>msg (\"Age?\")\nget input {\n  if (IsInt) {\n    player.age = ToInt (result)\n  } else {\n    msg (\"ERROR: wrong input: You did NOT type in an Integer (a non-decimal number), which you must do so, please try again\")\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>we're good now, right?</p>\n<p>well... not neccesarily.... unfortunately...</p>\n<p>the person could type in '-1', which would be a problem, as there's no such thing as a negative age (unless you want to count zygote to birth as negative age, lol), or they could type in '200', which, (in 2017) is impossible for a human to be that age, lol. for example:</p>\n<pre><code>msg (\"Age?\")\nget input {\n  if (IsInt) {\n    input_integer_variable = ToInt (result)\n    if (input_integer_variable &gt; 0 and input_integer_variable &lt; 120) {\n      player.age = ToInt (result)\n    } else {\n      msg (\"ERROR: wrong input: You must enter a number (Integer: non-decimal number) between 0 and 120, please try again\")\n    }\n  } else {\n    msg (\"ERROR: wrong input: You did NOT type in an Integer (a non-decimal number), which you must do so, please try again\")\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>now, we handled everything that's possible by user input, yay!</p>\n<p>though, most stuff requires a lot more handling than just what I've shown with this example</p>\n<hr>\n<p>a great way to store/save a specific clone as well as its origin (original object parent), is by using Attributes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>an Attribute on/of the clone Object itself for storing its (reference/pointer of its) original object, so you have access to it</li>\n<li>an Attribute elsewhere to store that specific (reference/pointer of the) clone object, so you have access to it</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>(see below)</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>create (\"box\") // creating our original object\n\nclone_object_variable = CloneObject (box) // cloning our box, and temporarily storing its reference/pointer to it, into our local/temporary 'clone_object_variable' Variable VARIABLE\n\n// we do this because/so-that, we can now do this:\n\nclone_object_variable.original_object_pointer_object_attribute = box // we're storing the (reference/pointer of/to the) 'box' (original object) into our 'original_object_pointer_attribute' Object (reference/pointer) Attribute, on our specific (and just made) clone object\n\nmsg (\"The original Object of our clone, \" + clone_object_variable.name + \", is: \" + clone_object_variable.original_object_pointer_object_attribute.name)\n\n// output/result:\n\nThe original Object of our clone, box1, is: box\n\n// here it what our Objects look like, an example:\n\n&lt;object name=\"box\"&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=\"box1\"&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=\"original_object_pointer_object_attribute\" type=\"object\"box&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n// and let's say we've made more clones (looped/did-again the scripting, say, 2 more times):\n\n&lt;object name=\"box\"&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=\"box1\"&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=\"original_object_pointer_object_attribute\" type=\"object\"box&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=\"box2\"&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=\"original_object_pointer_object_attribute\" type=\"object\"box&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=\"box3\"&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=\"original_object_pointer_object_attribute\" type=\"object\"box&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n// results/output:\n\nThe original Object of our clone, box1, is: box\nThe original Object of our clone, box2, is: box\nThe original Object of our clone, box3, is: box\n\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>(see below)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(see if you can understand/follow this without any comments/explanations on what is happening... as...

I'd say that's overkill when you could just do:</p>\n<pre><code>CloneObjectAndMove (Boar carcass, object.parent)\ndestroy (object.name)\nmsg (\"You killed the boar.\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>In that case, you'd put the meat/skin in the carcass object. Maybe it's a container, or maybe something more complex that requires extra tools to skin/butcher.</p>\n<p>Two ways to do it; you can use the one that best fits how you want the game to work.</p>\n\n",
