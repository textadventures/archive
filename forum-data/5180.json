If a property appears on a tab, then you get some clue about it, but there are others you have to delve deep into Quest to find. Each room has a Boolean attribute called &quot;visited&quot; that is useful if you want to know if the player had been there yet, but is not documented anywhere as far as I know and does not appear on any tabs. I discovered just yesterday that rooms have a &quot;transparent&quot; flag; not documented anywhere.",
