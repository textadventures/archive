(That is already in it's own thread and on it's way of getting taking care of, so no need to discuss it on here in detail.  I was just curious.)\n\nAlso is there a way to make a game downloadable for the Nintendo DS or 3DS, 2DS or what ever iteration they are on now?  They use the whole pen on the screen thing and can type out messages, etc.  Or at least they could with the original DS anyway...  And they have a lot of casual games as well.  I think decently made text adventures would fit in that category.",
