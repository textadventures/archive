How can I get my shop to actually charge?\r\nIf you buy from the traveling merchant, you just lose coins and get the item, even if the item costs more than what you have.\r\n\r\n2. Randomisation\r\nIs there a way to make the merchant encounters random?\r\n\r\n3. Level-related loot\r\nI'd like to have the loot dependent on the player's level. \r\n_E.G You get 1 gold × player level._\r\n\r\n4. ASCII Art\r\n(If you don't what this is, look it up.)\r\nWhenever I add ASCII art to my game (even using the ```<pre>``` html tags), squiffy squashes it into a little box.\r\n\r\nThanks",
