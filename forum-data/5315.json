      "EditableText": "Basically what you want is a get input, then have it repeat the same code if you enter an invalid option.\n\nThe method I'm currently using for this involves using a 'get input' with a 'switch' inside of it. Then for the default response you set an action that will repeat the whole thing if they didn't make an acceptable choice.\n\nThere are a few ways to create the loop, but basically you need the menu/question/whatever to be stored as a separate block of code somewhere to call it easily. Probably the most immediately obvious way is to create a Function that has your code, however I don't prefer this method unless its something you plan to reuse often, as having a lot of these can end up as clutter in the editor. Another way I have used is to have a room, and set the description to a script instead of text, then having the script call the function 'ShowRoomDescription()' to repeat itself. Probably the most flexible method is to store the actual script as an object attribute then call it from there, although it's a bit more complicated I think it's probably the best method I know of.\n\nEDIT: also a helpful trick if you aren't already using this, in any text you can use {command:input:text} to create a link that will show as the &quot;text&quot; part in the display and will act as though the player typed &quot;input&quot; in the command prompt. It doesn't have to be a valid input of any type, but will act as though the player typed whatever you put in the &quot;input&quot; section.",
