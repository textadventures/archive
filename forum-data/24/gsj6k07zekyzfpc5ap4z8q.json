      "EditableText": "I think I found a solution, albeit a dirty one. Squiffy doesn't seem to support an escape function for < tags, but you can use the Ascii code:\r\n\r\n    &lt;\r\n\r\nAs a substitute. So, using the above example, the code would become:\r\n\r\n    @title test\r\n    @set love = 9\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n    {if love&lt;10:show me}\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nThis seems to render correctly. \r\n\r\nI'm not completely happy with the solution a it's a bit messy, but unless an escape function exists it's probably the easiest solution.
