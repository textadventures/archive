It's as if the length of the text is what defines the size of the canvas.  I've found ways to keep it the same size, but when the text adventure goes on, the image stays at the top of the game so that when you scroll down, you only get the background color. I want to be able to scroll and only have the text scroll and the image stay perfectly in place. If there are any questions on what I mean by this, I'd be happy to specify further.",
