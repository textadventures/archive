But it's clunky - you have to click through to another section each time to update eg the selected hairstyle.\r\n\r\nI really want my users to see the paper doll update immediately, rather than having to do all of them and then output the result (and require the user to go through the whole thing each time to find a combination they like). So they select red - blonde - black - purple from a dropdown, and the paper doll updates immediately with the chosen colour. Is there a way to do this in Squiffy?",

I've actually been attacking this with a will this weekend and figured out a way of doing it within a single section with jQuery, with each layer of the PNG changing as the user changes the associated dropdown value. I'll share it with the group when it's finished - it's really cool!\r\n\r\nWhat I find frustrating with getting more complex javascript to work withinb Squiffy is that any script after the very first section gets ignored. So for example you can't have some initial script that relies on an onClick in an element later - the onClick just isn't recognised.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to get something like an old-school Concentration card-matching game working within Squiffy - you know the sort, a number of face down cards, user clicks on two to reveal the face image, if they match they remain face up, if not they go face down and the user tries again until all pairs have been matched, with a time and score at the end. But I can't figure out how to set that up without onClick (and other) events on the card elements!",
