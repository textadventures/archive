I apologize if this is asked elsewhere; I searched multiple times and couldn't find anything matching what I was looking for.\r\nSo I plan to start a game, and I will be working on both my PC and a laptop. If I do this while logged into my account, will my game sync between the two? Like if I work on my PC and make progress, then later want to open it up and continue on my laptop - is that an option? \r\n\r\nThanks!",
