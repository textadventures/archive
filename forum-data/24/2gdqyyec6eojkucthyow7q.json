In Javascript you can make random things happen.\r\n\r\n     ```var coin = Math.ceil(Math.random() *2 ); ```\r\n    ```squiffy.set(\"coin\", coin);```\r\n\r\nThis should be marked down in Squiffy as \r\n\r\n    {random weekday:Monday:Tuesday:Wednesday:Thursday:Friday}\r\n    {random coin:heads:tails}\r\n    {random die:1-6}\r\n\r\nThis is the same syntax as the already-existing {rotate coin:heads:tails}. Easy to learn and remember.\r\n\r\n2. In HTML and Javascript you can make inputs for the player to type in, and you have to use javascript to make Squiffy read it.\r\n\r\n        What's your name?
