But I dont know how I can add this...well, yeah, I know that I have to add the script that adsense gave me after <head>, or after <body> if <head> is not accesible. \r\n\r\nSo, I did this in my index.html. I put the script after <head>, immediately. But it´s not working...is there something that I can do to achieve this? Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nBest Regards!",
