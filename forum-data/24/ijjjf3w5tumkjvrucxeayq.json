      "EditableText": "Hmm, I use Edge all the time and have never had any issue with Squiffy. \r\n\r\nThe main known issue is that some browsers, in private browsing mode, will disable access to local storage.

Cookies are probably the safest option from a security point of view. \r\n\r\nI guess you could implement some sort of server side saving mechanism, storing it on the server rather than local PC, but then you'd not be able to play games offline. \r\n\r\nI did suggest some code to the main Squiffy developer that basically ran an initial check for access to local storage and, if not available, would throw up an explanation as to why the game would not run. \r\n\r\nIt would be pretty easy to develop this further so that, in the event of no access, the game disables the save system and tells the player that they will be unable to save. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you pop the code below into your index.html file it will show a pop-up if access to local storage is disabled.  \r\n\r\n    <script>\r\n    try { localStorage.test = 2; } catch (e) {\r\n    alert(\"my error message\");\r\n    }\r\n    </script>\r\n",
