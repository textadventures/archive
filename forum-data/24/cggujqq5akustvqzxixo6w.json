It's entirely possible I'm mixing JS and Squiffy incorrectly, any guidance would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI'm attempting to put a button at the bottom of my Section that allows users to check their 'inventory'. The inventory is a standalone section( [inventory] ) that functions as expected when a passage link is set to it. Here's my button setup:\r\n```\r\n<button type=\"button\"\r\n<button onClick=squiffy.story.go(\"inventory\");>Inventory.</button>\r\n```\r\nThe button displays as expected, but clicking it will not prompt the [inventory] passage.\r\nI've also tried removing the button logic entirely and simply entering:\r\n```\r\nsquiffy.story.go(\"inventory\")\r\n```\r\nThis also fails to trigger the [inventory] passage. Is there something I'm doing incorrectly with squiffy.story.go? Do I need to activate some additional js code in order to enable this?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nWill\r\n",

I see what I should have seen last time.\r\n\r\nI believe the `squiffy` object is kept in a closure, so it only accessible within the javascript part of a section.

A passage would start with `[inventory]:`.\r\n\r\nIf you mean it's a passage, then `squiffy.story.go` isn't the function you want.
