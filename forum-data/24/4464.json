Can someone who does know what they're doing walk me through:\n- What exactly I need to download\n- How to create a Squiffy file\n- How to play a test version, ie how to locally run it\n\nThink I get the second part - create your file in any text editor, save it as name.squiffy, then run squiffy.py name.squiffy to compile it...is that right? But I'm not 100% sure how even to do that...\n\nIf anyone has the time to provide a step by step guide to getting started, I (and I imagine many others) would be extremely grateful!\n\n(Also, are Squiffy files currently uploadable/playable on the main TA site?)",

Eventually there will be a web-based editor - before that, I'll probably create a simple online service where you can upload a Squiffy file and then download the generated game.\n\nUntil then, here's what to do:\n\n- if you're using Windows, you need to install Python from <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a><!-- m -->. Either Python 2 or Python 3 should work - I've been mostly testing with Python 2. If you're using a Mac, you already have Python 2.\n- install pip. If you're using Python 3 you've already got this (apparently). Otherwise follow the instructions at <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html\">https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html</a><!-- m -->\n- install the Markdown package by typing this at a command prompt or Terminal window: pip install markdown\n- download Squiffy by clicking &quot;Download ZIP&quot; at the bottom of the right-hand column on <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://github.com/textadventures/squiffy\">https://github.com/textadventures/squiffy</a><!-- m -->, and unzip it somewhere.\n\nYou can create a Squiffy file in any text editor - Notepad, Sublime Text, TextEdit etc. It's probably easiest to make a new folder inside your Squiffy folder and put it there.\n\ne.g. if your new folder is called &quot;mygame&quot; and your Squiffy file is &quot;mygame.squiffy&quot; then you can go to a command prompt and type:\n\n[code:3pr60jeh]\npython squiffy&#46;py mygame/mygame&#46;squiffy\n[/code:3pr60jeh]\n\nIf it all works then you'll get some files written into your &quot;mygame&quot; folder. Double-click index.html to play the game.\n\nYou can zip the files up and upload to textadventures.co.uk.",
