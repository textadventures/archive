When I set or change a variable in a section, it appears that the change is \"acquired\" by the system only after I move on the next section; if I want to show it in the same page, it shows the old value. But is there some way to make the system \"update\" the value during the view of the same section in which the value was set or modified? I have this feeling that it may be related to the command \"get\" but I'm not sure where I heard of it, I'm not even sure a \"get\" command exists in Squiffy.",
