The Squiffy UDL - this is the syntax colouring.  Once you have it in your Notepad++ you can customize it further to use your own colours\r\n2.  The Squiffy function list - this will fill Notepad++'s functionlist with a list of all sections and passages in the document.  You can easily see all their names, the order in which they appear and you can double-click them to navigate to those areas.  Way easier than the Squiffy Editor's dropdown list.\r\n3.  A couple of RUN commands for Notepad++'s own RUN menu.  One will do the traditional build to output all the regular files, and the other will simply compile the story.js file for you.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this stuff in my Github npp repository main page.  There are more directions in the xml files there for Notepad++.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BGMcoder/npp\r\n\r\nAnd stay tuned to the files for awhile, because I'm still updating them to make them better.\r\n",
