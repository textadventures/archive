KaiSD has a good idea - if you can get those files open in any other viewer, you could then paste them back into the squiffy editor and see if that works.\r\n\r\nSomething I always do (and this comes too late, of course). If I'm working on a game called filename, I always save a new version, i.e. filename1, filename2. I do this at the start of every coding session. This way, in case I enter a command that crashes it somewhere and I can fix it, or the editor conks out, I still have various working versions. When I'm ready for release, I rename it back to filename, save off all the other versions, and ship it to my game page.\r\n\r\nThis was very useful when I discovered that the editor was not listing any new sections I'd added. They would run like normal sessions, and you could see them on the screen, but the pulldown list of sections wouldn't work right. I ended up going back a night or two to a version that worked fine, and then pasting the new sections in (from a txt file, as KaiSD suggests) one at a time until everything was rebuilt.\r\n\r\nHope you can restore.",
