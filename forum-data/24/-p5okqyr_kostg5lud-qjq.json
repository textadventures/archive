For example, the character, a girl, who follows the protagonist around has an opportunity to get a slight wardrobe upgrade as a result of the protag buying it for her in order to hurry her along from a dangerous situation. I wanted to make it to where that gained accessory can follow her through future short stories by giving an option at the end of the story to continue to the next, but have certain links lead to the story where she'd have the accessory vs. ones that would lead to the next story where she wouldn't have that accessory depending on the choices the reader picked. I feel the most affective way to do that is by having the ability to make stories that can only be found through a link, but I don't even know if Squiffy has that option, let alone how to do it. I was hoping for some advice on this, if it would be possible, and if not, what would be a sufficient alternative?",

I was specifically trying to link up two different squiffy stories, and I was wondering if there was a way to privatize a squiffy, so that the only way you can get to that one is with a link via the other squiffy. Additionally I wanted to see if it was possible so that I could select people play a WIP of said squiffy and tell me their thoughts before I release it publicly. But as I've stated, as much as I'd prefer to upload several squiffies for each individual plot I plan on writing, I'm realizing in the long run that it may be in my best interest to just upload one and update with the additional plots over time, and then work the earned accessory in that way.",
