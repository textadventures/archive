At that point I'd usually make the rooms and necessary procedures and functions in the game before I write content, but do it in stages so there are portions of playable games to test. There are a few FAQs out there you might want to check out. You can probably google them or search this forum as they've been linked before. If you're making a complex game you'll likely want to plan it out and create a general timeline and storyline to diffuse ambiguity and make the gameplay more consistent.",

I figured that theres no need to get into the making of the game if there's no game to make..LOL We're compiling alot of data for our game. I only hope that this will turn out as good as my vision in my mind.\n\n\nthanks again.",
