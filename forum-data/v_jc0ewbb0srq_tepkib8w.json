Taking a crack at making a simple text adventure game, and I need a bit of help understanding something. \r\n\r\nThe situation I've set up is having an NPC dealing the player 3 tarot cards, then flipping them over and revealing each one with the following function.\r\n\r\n    <function name=\"tarotchoice\">\r\n    msg (\"The man lays his hand on the leftmost of the three cards, and in one fluid motion flips it over.\")\r\n    wait {\r\n      card1 = PickOneChild (tarotdeck)\r\n      firstcard.alias = card1\r\n      card1pic\r\n      msg (\"Before you on the table, a stylized tarot card with \\'\" + GetDisplayName(card1) + \"\\' written on the bottom.\")\r\n      MoveObject (card1, boundcards)\r\n    }\r\n  </function>\r\n\r\nThis works fine, and when the 'card1pic' function is called in the middle there, it also works fine and displays the randomly selected card's picture.\r\n\r\n    <function name=\"card1pic\">\r\n    if (firstcard.alias = Death) {\r\n      picture (\"Death.jpg\")\r\n    }\r\n(there are like 20 more if/then's for the rest of the cards).\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I had some trouble getting it to do that. I'm on desktop, and for a while I was trying to do everything in code view. And when I typed up the list of card pictures in code view, it would keep giving me \r\n\r\n    \"Error compiling expression 'firstcard.alias = (((card)))': Unknown object or variable '(((card)))'\".\r\n\r\nBut when I went back in the non-code interface and added script \"if (object attribute equals) Object (object) (firstcard) Attribute (alias) = (((card)))\" by clicking on the little blue down arrow and selecting which card I wanted, it worked without a hitch. I went back and did it for every single card except Wheel Of Fortune (which I typed in), and that's the only one that isn't working now (for the sake of error reproduction).\r\n\r\nAm I going to have to keep editing this in the non-code thing? Is something big flying over my head here? Is there something I should be doing that I'm not doing to make this run smoothly?\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post. Thanks for any help!",
