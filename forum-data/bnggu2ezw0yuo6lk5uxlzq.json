      "EditableText": "I think you probably have two options, one is easier to implement but less accurate and vice versa.\r\n\r\n**Easy option**\r\nIf you know the length of your audio file, you could simply use the following Javascript to advance to the next section after a certain amount of time has passed. In this example 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(function(){ squiffy.story.go(\"nextsection\");}, 10000);\r\n\r\nThe downside to this method is that if the player is playing online in a browser, the audio may take some time to download before it starts playing, meaning that the sound might not, for example, actually start until 3 seconds have passed and then end prematurely when the 10 seconds expire. You can almost get around this with HTML5 audio preloading option (which means the download will occur before it has to play), but this wont work on all browsers (particularly mobile ones) and the issue may remain.\r\n\r\n**Harder option**\r\nMy suggestion would be that you make use of the HTML5 function \"onended\", which will detect when an audio file has finished. \r\n\r\nThe code would look something like:\r\n\r\nIn your main HTML template header:\r\n\r\n    <audio id=\"myAudio\" controls>\r\n    <source src=\"mymusic.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\r\n    Your browser does not support the audio element.\r\n    </audio>\r\n\r\nIn your section:\r\n\r\n    var aud = document.getElementById(\"myAudio\");\r\n    aud.onended = function() {\r\n    squiffy.story.go(\"nextsection\");\r\n    };\r\n\r\nIn theory (I haven't tested the code) that should play the music / sound and then, on complete, tell Squiffy to advance to the next section. I can't see why it shouldn't work, but let me know.\r\n\r\n**Note about mobile browsers**\r\n\r\nAs touched upon, Mobile operating systems put restrictions on the use of audio (to prevent users downloading huge files on their data plan). If you want a mobile user to enjoy your sound, you have to tie the initial load to a \"user event\", such as clicking a button etc. \r\n\r\nMore info: http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/1658-how-to-play-music-on-both-desktop-and-mobile/\r\n\r\n",

If the purpose of the fade is simply to fade in the animated gif, I'd target the container rather than the whole body. If you really want to target the entire body, I'd personally handle it outside of a section, as part of the main HTML template.\r\n\r\nAfter your Javascript, you've included a body tag. Remember, the code you output via Squiffy will already be contained within a body tag, so you're invalidating your HTML by adding more. I suspect this is what is causing your issue, but more on this in a second. Essentially your file now looks like:\r\n\r\n    <html>\r\n    <head></head>\r\n    <body>\r\n    *template content*\r\n    <body>\r\n    *your content\r\n    </body>\r\n    </body>\r\n\r\nAlso, just a comment but you seem to be somewhat over-complicating displaying your animated gif. Why not just use:\r\n\r\n    <img class=\"image\" src=\"myimage\">\r\n\r\nYou don't appear to be making use of the DIV other than to display the picture, so why not just display the picture?\r\n\r\nThe animated gif file is pretty large at just under 10mb. That will take some time to download (plus the music), which will likely throw everything out of sync (as discussed in my original response and why this approach is easier but not the best solution).\r\n\r\nHowever, that all said, the timeout function should move the user to the next section (entitled Main Menu) after 40 seconds. It's possible some of your malformed HTML is causing issues, but it shouldn't have any further influence once it has triggered. My best guess is that the inclusion of the erroneous BODY tag just after the Javascript  is causing the next section timeout to be retained even when the user moves to the next, as it's being interpreted by Squiffy as part of the HTML template, and not code that belongs within a Section.
