To show this I've set up a dummy game at:\r\n```\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/hptwnf35qkwtcgankcqn3w/sound-issue\r\n```\r\nThis problem ONLY occurs when the game is downloaded and played locally. To try it out, use the sequence:\r\n```\r\nsound 1\r\nsound 2\r\nsound 3\r\nsave\r\n```\r\nSaving and resuming the same game online is fine.\r\n\r\nThoughts and wordarounds welcome!",
