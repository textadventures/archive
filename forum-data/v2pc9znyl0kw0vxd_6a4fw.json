      "EditableText": "Hello everyone\r\n\r\nThe Games Technology department at Bournemouth University is conducting a user experience study on improving mental resilience through the use of an interactive narrative application and invites participants over the age of 18 to take part. The storytelling experience will prompt participants to engage in choice-based conversational storytelling and allow them to traverse a narrative as well as engage in optional reading and writing activities.\r\n\r\nParticipants will have to complete two short surveys before and after using the application to give us an overview of their experience. A group of participants who agree, will be further invited for a follow-up short interview.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested to know more about the study and learn about the application, please send an email to Sofia Kitromili at **skitromili@bournemouth.ac.uk** to express your interest or sign up for the study.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
