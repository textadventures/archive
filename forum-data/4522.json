I read on another thread that you could change the player object or do a foreach thing, but I really don't know how I'd pull off either. \n\nI tried doing a foreach, but what do I put for loop variable? How do I create that variable and what should it be? Then when I move each object to a container do I use the same variable for that script?\n\nHaven't tried the player object changing thing. \n\nAnyone want to at least point me in the right direction?\n\nThanks.",
