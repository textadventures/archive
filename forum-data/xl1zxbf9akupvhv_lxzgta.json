Specifically, I had an idea for a game where you play as a teenager living under strict parents, not allowed to date,  but you are \"hot to trot\", so to speak, and so your goal is to sneak out of the house, go to a big party, hook up with someone and, um, get frisky, and then get back into the house without getting caught.  Would such a game be acceptable, and if so, how, um, detailed can I get about the friskiness? Or should I stick to tamer stuff (most of my story ideas are of the latter sort)?",

So, you need to either make sure the character is an adult (\"Why do my parents treat me like a little kid? I'm 18 already!\") or stop short of including sex.",
