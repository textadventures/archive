Every function must have name, and that is the name you use to invoke the function in some other script. \n\n- parameters: These are the values (if any) passed into the function. You give them names, and when the function is called, those parameters must be set by giving values in the function call (e.g. MyFunction(a, b) ). The values are mapped to the parameters in the order they are given. If your function does not take input parameters, then you can omit this or leave it as an empty string.\n\n- type: This is the return type of the function (the value passed out), if the function returns a value. Some functions do, and some don't. If you use a &quot;return&quot; statement in your function to send a value back to the caller, then you need to specify the return type, so that Quest knows what type the function is expected to return. If your function does not return a value, then you can omit this or leave it an empty string.\n\nHere is a trivial example. It's a function to concatenate two strings and return the result.
