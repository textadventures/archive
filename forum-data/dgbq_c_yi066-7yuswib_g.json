      "EditableText": "Hi folks\r\n\r\nI'm new to Squiffy so playing around with a basic game to get to grips with things and have hit a snag. I have a scenario where a \"knife\" attribute is set earlier in one section and then I want to move the outcome of a fight to one of two passages based on whether the character has picked up the knife. I'm using the following:\r\n\r\n    [[JailerFight]]:\r\n    {if knife=1:[Kill Jailer]}{else:[Killed by Jailer]}\r\n    [Kill Jailer]:\r\n    You kill the jailer\r\n    [Killed by Jailer]:\r\n    The jailer kills you\r\n\r\nbut when I run the game (and I've got the knife) I get a link to the \"Kill Jailer\" passage rather than the text of the passage. I can click that link and then see the text, but I want to move straight to \"You kill the jailer\" appearing.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",
