For example, if I talk to a woman, she gives me a clue about murderer(adding a flag to the murderer), but his isn't enough to convict him, so i need to talk to a man, so i can get another clue(flag) and when I talk to the police, they check if the murderer has those flags and he can arrest him. But I don't know how to put &quot;and&quot; mark, like: If, object has flag, object: murderer, flag name: murderer and killer. So how can i get it to check is he has both murderer AND killer flags, or is there more simple way to do this?",
