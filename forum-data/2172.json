      "EditableText": "I've been working on a game for some time now, and I've let a few friends test it. They loved it so much they wanted me to turn it into an actual game. I've done enough coding to make a demo version of it, and thus tried to use the packager. Everything seemed to be going good at first, it said it found all the resource's. Only problem is, one of the ones it found doesn't exists. It says:\n\nFound resource &quot; .wav &quot; \n\n .. then when it goes to add the files, it says it can't find &quot; .wav &quot; \n\n I've looked under the resource tab for the game in the QDK editor, and nothing is listed. Not to mention there are no wav files in my game, only MP3's. I'm at a complete loss. I did have one originally in the beginning, but I removed it.  Also, it doesn't seem to have a file name, just the extension: &quot; .wav &quot;\n\n Any help at all would be most appreciated.",
