      "EditableText": "As you are talking about 'Rooms\" I suppose you are using the Text Adventures mode. So, there is not a special order in it. Think your rooms are just there. Exits you set for each room creates a connection between them in the order and way you wish. If an exit leads from Room 1 to Room 2, it doesn't means necessarily that the other way around is also true. (Good for creating a hole in the ground room)\r\n\r\nSo, there is not an order the rooms come, one after the other. You just connect them. Quest comes with this exot feature for each room, but using some programming may also do the job, like \"teleporting\" the player from one room to the other. The game has this \"player\" object, which tells the game in what room the player currently is. Using a command like move, targeted on ovject player to room X, makes the job too.\r\n\r\nIf it is the case you are not a programming person, take your time taking a look at the documentation and the GUI. Using the GUI, you make Quest write down the code for you in an intuitive (and script noob) way. It is very useful and my main tool of scripting. There you will find the \"Objects\" script and then inside it, \"Move Object\". It is just tell your game yu want moving object player to object room X. Quite simple.",
