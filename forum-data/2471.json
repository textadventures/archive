Like if you have an item &quot;ladder&quot; and you want the person to say &quot;put ladder down&quot;. (This is the best example i could think of on the spot) The verbs always put the object at the end like Climb &quot;ladder&quot; or put down &quot;ladder&quot; But if you wanted put &quot;ladder&quot; down. How do you put the object in the middle of a phrase?\n\nAlso if anyon has any help or ideas for my use item post &quot;problems&quot; below this post it would be great.",
