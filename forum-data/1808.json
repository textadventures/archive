I think all of you will enjoy it.  There was a walkthrough that I submitted with my game to the comp that I did not upload into textadventures.  If anyone needs it, please leave a post here and I will PM it to you.\n\nI do not know if any of you are wanting to play &quot;Gathered in Darkness&quot; or not, but it is coming.  I am finishing the massive editing required from my journey into the IFcomp of 2007.\n\n\n***Please NOTE:  Cabin Fever purposely disables the side panes of Quest.  Do not override that feature or the game will not work properly.******\n\nThanks,\n\nDr. Froth",
