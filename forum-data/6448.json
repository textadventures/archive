I am certain when I can sit down and read through all of the documentation and watch the tutorials and such the answers likely lie within. However, for just the basic just imagining what I want to do phase though, burning questions I have to ask: Does quest have functions to allow a 'party' system (multiple characters controlled by the player), is it possible to have a 'hub' or 'home base' where one could switch out and select different party members and then go out on missions, and is it possible to have passive behind the scenes abilities active that would affect the entire party? As in, you select who is serving as field leader for the squad and that leader gives some sort of buff to the team. At this point I dont need to know the fine details about how such things would work, just for invisioning my ideas if it is even something at all possible. \n\nThanks in advance!",

A word of advice: you should begin with a first, simplier game, to become familiar with the basics and try the scripts you'd need for your big game.\n\nGood luck!",

I can think of two ways you could do this, neither one is built-in and would require you to do some serious altering of the built-in stuff.  Also neither one is very simple for a beginner.  I've been here for a couple years and I would struggle to design something like this.  In VERY short... you could add a new inventory box and rename it party.  You would control the main character and the party would travel with you.  When an event happens you could initiate a turnscript that cycles a turn that allows the player to choose the action of that party member and then changing the player character to the next in the party.  This would be how I would initially try to do it for turn-based battle scenarios.  For non-battle scenarios (like getting different results for different party members talking to NPCs, for example) you could use commands to &quot;become&quot; or &quot;control&quot; a player in the party box.  It's certainly tricky, but I think quite possible.  \n\n[quote=&quot;Pyrceval&quot;:3s51ux1b]is it possible to have a 'hub' or 'home base' where one could switch out and select different party members and then go out on missions[/quote:3s51ux1b]  Yes, this part is easier than the actual exploring.  You could meet new players on your journeys and move them to your &quot;camp&quot; or whatever.
