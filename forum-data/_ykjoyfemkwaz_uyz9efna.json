(In other words... not a line of code for scripting to be put in for every single object and or room, just one line of code to rule them all.)\r\n\r\nUnder Game in the Room Descriptions tab, I see a box to check to \"Clear screen when entering a room\" and also a box to uncheck to \"(not)Display commands entered by the player\".  That helps a lot in keeping the screen clean.  \r\n\r\nHowever I am experimenting with what works best and was wondering with every turn (commands of the player???) is there a way to make all the text disappear, besides the most current text?  The player would have to retype Look Room of course and it would re-appear.  But if they typed Look Bed, now only the bed description is visible on the main play screen, nothing else preceding would be visible.\r\n\r\nIf not already implemented and I some how missed it, why is it not available straight out of the box as it were?  What are your thoughts on that style of play?  Too much, too little, or simply inconsequential?  Thank you.",
