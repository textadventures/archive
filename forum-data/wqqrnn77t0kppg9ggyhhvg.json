But I want that, if people take the box, the description doesn't mention it the next time the player enters the room. Like this: \r\n\r\nNice room, there is a box on the flor. \r\n>take box\r\n\r\nWoah, best box ever. \r\n>west\r\n>east\r\n\r\nNice room.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me here? Thanks! :)",
