Areas (for me) are groups of rooms that start with 100 and end with 999.  I don't want to have to use up all rooms in an area but I want to be able to do so if I choose to.  So numbering my rooms by area and room give me something like 1-100 which is area 1 room 100, which is the 'control room' for my game.\n\nSo I want to be able to first create an area by using a simple command /create area &lt;insert area number here&gt; and have it create a segment that is able to handle rooms 100 - 999 and won't let you go over the limit.  If the segment is already created, I want it to say so and stop the command, and if it hasn't been, I want it to create a blank room of the segment plus the first room number of the segment (i.e. 2-100) and move me to it.  Hehe, I hope this is making sense so far.\n\nI then want to be able to /create room &lt;insert seg-room number here&gt;.  If the segment isn't created yet, I want it to tell me so and stop the command.  If it is and the room number is already created then I want it to stop the command.  If it isn't, then create the room and move me to it.(ie 2-101).\n\nSo now we get to the fun part.  I want to be able to modify the name of the room and the description of the room via a command /modify name &lt;insert text here&gt; /modify description &lt;insert text here&gt; that will only change the name and description of the room you are standing in at the time.  So you won't be able to modify room 2-100 if you are standing in room 5-963.  And I think that is all on the rooms for now...\n\nAs for items...this is going to be tricky for me to explain I think...anywho, I want to create some basic items that can be copied via the /create &lt;item&gt; command.  Say I have a basic prop, a basic sword, and a basic table set with properieties befitting their type so I won't have to modify every single one I create and put them into an 'item_Storage' room.  /create prop would come up with moving a copy of the blank prop to your hand that you can then /modify prop for its new name and description.  I would like to also be able to modify properties via a similar command.\n\nI have a lot more questions and ideas but I think that is more than enough to get me started.  If anyone could help, that would be wonderful, if I sound horribly confusing or confused...it is because I am <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) -->.\n\nThanks,\nPlayer of a few too many.",
