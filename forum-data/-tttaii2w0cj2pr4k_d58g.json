I sincerely believe that text adventure games are good for imagination, so I'm leaned towards those type of games as a programming student.\r\nThe game starts around some ghetto setting and it has a good amount of options for a game that's in pre-alpha yet. You can work, eat, fight, have conversations and seek a secret, that is the murder of a police officer that was recently murdered somehow.\r\nIt would be good to get some feedback on what to add into the game and story, which is still pretty short, but will expand as time goes on.\r\nI hope you'll enjoy the first early release :)\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/tqvpagvucu_6uf4udv8ebg/buster",
