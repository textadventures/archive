It seems so simple however it also seems tedious as once again I want there to be a vast story to every choice you make. I have this adventure set up to where you can sort of create your character, You can choose their gender and even their class in the first few pages of the story. However the problem I see first hand is right after the player chooses their gender, not only do I have to create a story for if they choose their character being Male but now I have to create a new page and rewrite similar spots to fit if they had chosen Female. I feel like a lot of time and effort could be reduced if i could use things like IF.

Note that the two texts are separated by a vertical bar, to ensure nesting works properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some more:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n{page:command}\r\nAs command (an alternative name that may be prefered for game books).\r\n\r\n{page:command:text}\r\nAs command (an alternative name that may be prefered for game books).\r\n\r\n### Additional text adventure commands\r\n{object:name}\r\nDisplays an object hyperlink, using the object’s display alias.\r\n\r\n{object:name:link text}\r\nDisplays an object hyperlink, using text you specify.\r\n\r\n{exit:name}\r\nDisplays an exit hyperlink. The name is the name you give to the exit (by default exits do not have names; you will need to give it a name yourself). The link will appear as the exit’s alias (“north”, “up”, etc.)\r\n\r\n{rndalt:object}\r\nDisplay a randomly chosen name from an object’s alt list.\r\n\r\n{if attribute:text}\r\nDisplay text only if game attribute is true\r\n\r\n{if not attribute:text}\r\nDisplay text only if game attribute is false\r\n\r\n{select:object.attribute:text 0:text 1:text 2}\r\n{select:object.attribute:text 0|text 1|text 2}\r\nSelects one text to display, based on the value of the object attribute (you can have as many sections as you like). Note that the attribute must be an integer (whole number), and the sections number from zero. The second form, with texts separated by vertical bars, allows additional text processor directives to be nested inside the select directive. This is new to Quest 5.7.\r\n\r\n### Additional text adventure commands in Quest 5.7\r\n{i:text} Displays the given text in italic.\r\n\r\n{b:text} Displays the given text in bold. To do bold and italic, nest the commands, like this: {b:{i:very important}}.\r\n\r\n{u:text} Displays the given text in underline.\r\n\r\n{s:text} Displays the given text in strike-through.\r\n\r\n{colour:colour:text} Displays the given text in the colour specified (you can also used “color”, by the way).\r\n\r\n{back:colour:text} Displays the given text with the colour specified as the background. To show text as white on black, you can combine these like this: {colour:white:{back:black:some highlighted text}}.\r\n\r\n{here object:text} Displays the text only if the given object is in the current room (but not if in the player’s inventory or in a container in the room).\r\n\r\nThe beach is long, and the sand almost white. {here mary:You can see Mary, building a sand castle.}\r\n{nothere object:text} Displays the text only if the given object is NOT in the current room.\r\n\r\nThe beach is long, and the sand almost white. {nothere mary:You wonder where Mary could be.}\r\n{popup:text:long text} Displays a link, with the first text (which cannot have text processor directives nested in it). When the player clicks on the link, a pop-up will be displayed, containing the long text. The pop-up will disappear when the long text is clicked on. This can be used with the img command to have an image pop-up.\r\n\r\n{either condition:text} This works similar to the if command above, but with two important differences. The first is the the condition can be any Quest code that results in a Boolean (true or false). The second is that if you are comparing a string it needs to be in double quotes (as is true of normal Quest code).\r\n\r\n{either condition:text|text} As before, but the second text is only seen when the condition fails. Note that the two texts are separated by a vertical bar, to ensure nesting works properly.\r\n\r\n\"You {either StartsWith(player.name, \\\"play\\\") and not player.flag:are the player}\"\r\n -> \"You are the player\",\r\n\"'Oh, {either player.male**flag:he|she} is not worth it.'\"\r\n -> \"'Oh, he is not worth it.'\",\r\n{eval:code} The code is evaluated, just as normal Quest code is, and the result displayed.\r\n\r\n{=code} This is a short cut for eval, and works just the same.
