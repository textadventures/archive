If you do this, you set up your array (in Quest you can't have 2 dimensional... so you need one BIG array of 9999 for 99x99), and then use that to store names of objects etc. That I think is nice - but does get a little annoying every now and then, checking the array.\nThen there's ITID's idea about object properties. Using them to give a position on a grid. I love this idea, so simple, and you can apply it to all the objects really easily.\nNow, the thing that get's me is, if you have a big grid (9999x9999) and have ALOT of objects around the place (let's say 0.1 percent inhabited) 99999 objects, that'll take ALOT of time to go through all the objects to do some rules. On the other hand, the grid size is over the amount quest can use as an array (99999999). So ITID's way technically 'wins', but is slower than an array-based engine if it was possible (as in an array, you only have to check a few values).",

Okay people, correct me if I say something  wrong or stupid, because I am a beginner at QDK, and I don't even know how  to program; I use the interface. But I had an idea of what I would do if I had this problem, or if I was making this game. Okay. What I would do is go to &quot;custom player commands&quot; and say &quot;If player types in (exe) 1,3, bring them to room1.&quot; Now, if you are not making a lot of rooms, that won't be hard.  (Even if you need to make 10 or 20 rooms that way.) If I understand you correctly, your problem is if someone would type in a nonexistent room, say, 1,99, and it would display &quot;No such thing&quot; or something like that. My first idea would be to make an array (I hope I'm correct; someone tell me if I'm not, because I have never  actually written an array and I'm not sure how, but I get the idea of how it works) so that , lets say you make 10 rooms. Program 1,1, to take you to room1, 1,2, to take you to room2, until room10. Then, make an array that if &quot;anynumber,anynumber&quot; (by that I mean anything by anything, like 5,9,) is typed in, display a certain message, such as &quot;That planet is inaccessible with your means of travel.&quot; That is my worst idea. They get better lol. My second  (and better) idea is that you should have a custom command, such as &quot;travel.&quot; Then, make a menu. Now, instead of just typing, &quot; 1,2&quot; a player types in &quot;travel&quot; first, to let you know he wants to travel. Then you make the menu. The menu should be a popup menu that says: &quot;Please choose a destination&quot; and it will list all the player's possible choices. That way, a player can choose one and you don't need to worry about the player typing in a non-existent room and receiving a wrong (or unwanted) message.  Now, here is my last idea. It will be the same custom command. &quot;Travel.&quot; Except this time, instead of having a menu pop up, go to &quot;enter next command into string variable.&quot; Then do all your rooms as &quot;if's&quot;. For example: &quot;Enter players next command into &quot;travel&quot; string.&quot; Then make all the following: &quot;If #travel# is equal to 1,1,    then  move player to room1&quot;     Then add. &quot;If #travel# is equal to 1,2, then move player to room2&quot; and so on and so on until you &quot;If&quot; your 10 rooms. THEN you do: &quot;If #travel# is equal  to_______&quot; in that space, if you want, you can type in numbers 1 through 99. That would take a while, but not too long, I think. The way you do it is by adding a ; between words. That way, the game recognizes it as multiple optional commands. For example, you would type in &quot;If #travel# is equal to 2,1;2,2;2,3;2,4;2,5;2,6;2,7.â€¦&quot;and so on then display the&quot; You can't get thereâ€¦.&quot; Message. Anyway, those are my ideas, and I hope you can actually understand what I mean. Good luckâ€¦",
