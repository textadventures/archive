      "EditableText": "Hi guys!\r\n\r\nThis may be a retarded question, but I'm trying to implement 'the blue continue hyperlink' in my game. Basically to show more text after the player clicks this link. Sounds pretty simple but I can't figure it out for the life of me. I looked up the documentation and I came across the script 'wait for key press'. All nice and well but it only continues to the new line of text AFTER the player hits any key on the keyboard. I don't see an actual hyperlink, and since my game doesn't rely on the command bar, this may be a bit of an issue. It just stays blank until I hit a key on my keyboard... then the new line of text shows up.\r\n\r\nHow can I make it so I can actually see the hyperlink below the text.\r\n\r\nI'm using the program Quest 5.8",
