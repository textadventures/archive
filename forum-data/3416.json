TA is the main publishing site for Quest and has been evolving into a platform for any web-based text adventure. IFDB is the catalog for all IF, online or not, 'out-of-print' or current. I don't think it's necessary or even desirable to have one site that rules them all, especially by popular vote. In my experience on sites that use votes it just leads to fairly meaningless vote wars, vote pumping, etcetera. I think IFDB's rating system is a better mechanism.",
