If you use complex nested if statements (around 4 or 5) then it will make a mistake in the syntax and occasionally place the braces in wrong positions. This also is portrayed as a \"other script command\" in red txt when you examine in QDK (after restarting that procedure, etc.) I'm not sure if this bug has already been discussed, but if it hasn't, it's fairly easy to recreate.\n\n&lt;Psych07ik_S1aY3R&gt;",

I've had reports of a bug that breaks ASL files by moving braces to the wrong places, or something similar, but I'm not able to reproduce that problem. I can reproduce the \"other script command\" problem - but that only affects the way QDK displays the set of script commands, and not the way they're saved. If you edit them they're all still there!",

This is AS WELL as the other script command error. I'm not sure of the errors when crashing since I fix it manually before I run qdk or quest again.",

Do this a few times and it will screw up the braces and give a Run-time 6 Error (Overflow i think) when QDK is run again.\nI can give more info if you want. The code looks weird after this, it's kinda hard to decipher.",
