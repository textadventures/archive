I think most Squiffy games work well; and there was some chat recently about making the online editor a little easier to use on mobile.\r\n\r\nThere's also Quest 6, a completely new system unrelated to Quest which some people are working on. It looks like it's being built in pure JS, so it should work on any platform (although whether there will be a mobile-optimised layout I can't say).\r\n\r\nI'm still intending to translate all of the Quest engine into javascript directly, giving a platform-independent way to play the existing games; but that's going to be a very big project, and I can't afford to take time away from writing until I get a few more people actually buying my books. So anything code-heavy is on the back burner for the foreseeable future.",
