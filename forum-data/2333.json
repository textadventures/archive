      "EditableText": "Hello, \n\nI have a room in the game I'm working on that is actually a lake, so I want traveling verbs that make more sense contextually. For example, instead of &quot;go west,&quot; I want players to use &quot;swim west.&quot; So I made a new verb &quot;swim,&quot; and made it synonymous with &quot;go.&quot; It works fine, but I want the use of &quot;swim&quot; to be isolated to the lake room only. It wouldn't make sense in the other rooms without any water for the player to still be able to &quot;swim&quot; around. Is there any way to do this? \n\nOther questions:\n\n- Let's say I want players in the lake room to be able to &quot;swim&quot; when moving laterally (west, south, etc.), but in order to go to the room &quot;underwater&quot; (down), have to specifically type &quot;dive.&quot; Is it possible limit different moving verbs to particular directions? I'd also need to be able to print special messages if a player tries to use the wrong verb with a direction (ex. &quot;The current is too strong, you need to dive instead,&quot; or if they're not in the lake, &quot;You can't swim on land, try finding some water.&quot;)\n\n- Can I completely disable non-contextual verbs in a particular room? Such as with the lake room, can I disable &quot;go&quot; entirely for this room only, forcing players to type &quot;swim,&quot; &quot;dive,&quot; etc. instead, while retaining the use of &quot;go&quot; in other rooms?\n\nThanks!\n- Jeremy",

Use the &quot;Edit Custom Player Commands...&quot; in the Advanced-menu of each room to create a swim #to#-command for this room. With skripts you can parse the direction and move the player to the next room. Look at the attached test2.asl",
