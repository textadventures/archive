I've tackled the potions in my game via the tutorial he's posted, but now that I'm trying to extend that logic to weapons, things are not working. Specifically, I have several daggers in my game, and I've managed to get them to stack. But I can't equip them. I've set up the stack object to do the following when the verb \"equip\" is called:\r\n```\r\nDoStackVerb (this, \"equip\")\r\n```\r\nWhen I run the same script for my potion stack but with \"drink\", I drink the potion and the code works fine. But when I try to equip a dagger, it says \"I don't have it.\" I can't for the life of me figure out why one works and the other doesn't.",
