I have not been on the IF scene for a while, but the last time I checked, this was the easiest, most intuitive and most powerful IF creator, where if something is not already in the easy drop box feature, it can be coded.  And helpful people to assist with such a request.\r\n\r\nMaybe Quest was mentioned somewhere else and I just missed it.  Regardless, I just thought I would put that out there.  If anyone has access to the Wiki, at least include Quest as a recommendation.  It totally deserves it.",
