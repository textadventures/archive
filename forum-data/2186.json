One of my good friends downloaded it and said that he was able to go north into the hall without having first found the key. I tested out the asl file, and checked the coding, everything checked out. I then tried installing the game on my computer via the setup file, and it was then I got the same problem he did. I was able to go into the hall right from the start, and I hadn't found, or used the key. Then I saw that Quest version 4.1.1. was available, so I upgraded in hopes that would fix the problem, no such luck. I even tried to repackage the asl using 4.1.1. same problem. \n\n On a brighter note, the error I pointed out before with the packager not recognizing .wav has been fixed.\n\nAny help would be grateful",
