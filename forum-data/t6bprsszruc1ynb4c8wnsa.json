I understand the back log has to be long due to the amount of games trying to be published and real life issues/not enough volunteers to go around.\r\n\r\nHowever for further clarification, if I am using the desktop version can I still give someone a \"link\" for player testing/thoughts?  Or I have to attempt to publish it first and while it waits to be reviewed, I can use the link it shows and others can play/test it in the mean time?\r\n\r\nAlso does the author have any say in what category it will be put into it?  For mine it could go into several, but I would prefer to choose one out of the many if possible.  I think the game asks you what it is when you are creating it anyway.  I am just not sure if that is what the reviewers will even consider or if there is a bunch of puzzles in the game, even though the theme is not a puzzler, if they would put it under Puzzle instead of something else.\r\n\r\nAlso can a game have multiple categories?  I am not seeing that from the other games, unless there is a main and several other categories listed on the side that I am not aware of.  As again, mine falls under many or will when it is all said and done.  Thank you.",
