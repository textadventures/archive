That didn't work straight away since SetTimeout loses the parameters passed to the enclosing function, and those parameters need to be passed on.\n\nA hack solution would be to store the parameters in the game object so that, after the timeout, the script could access them and pass them on. That would work if the player types a command and then waits for something to happen. However, if the player types a command (or clicks a link or something) and then enters another command before the initial timeout ends, then it would stomp on the variables in the game object and lose any previous command.\n\nThis can be solved by having a list of command/metadata pairs in the game object, as a queue for pending commands. The question is, is all of this really worth it? Especially since the goal is to make the game experience (in my opinion) worse for the player. If you do still want it, I could try to make the code work.\n\nEdit: Also, keep in mind that if you offer the game online on the Quest website, there will be a lag in there anyway since the online player is server based. (I wish I could get *rid* of that in my games.) You could try publishing your game privately online and see if it's not a problem to begin with. lol",
