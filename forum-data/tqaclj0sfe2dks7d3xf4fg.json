I want to make an object so that when the player moves it, it will reveal another object/exit.\r\n       2. Using the use/give feature, how do I make it so that you can use/give on or to a specific object or character?\r\n       3. How do I make it so that you can take something or go through an exit _only_ when you have a certain object or talked to a certain character?\r\n       \r\n       Thank you!!!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "EditableText": "**1)** The most simple way I can think of is creating a verb on the object, then using a script to make the new object appear in the room. For example...\r\n\r\noriginal.object\r\nVerb tab, add verb\r\nPoof (or whatever you want the verb to be)\r\nScript:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"You activate the switch or open the box and a new object appears!\")\r\nMoveObjectHere (newobject) \r\n```\r\nBut there are a lot of other ways to do this and make it cleaner. But for a beginner I suggest the most basic.\r\n\r\n**2)** On the object make sure you go to the _Features Tab_ and then check the _Use/Give Box_. After that, go to the _Use/Give Tab_ and on the first category _Use (on it's own)_, click \"Run Script\".  This will be assuming the player already has the object as this script is on that object. \r\nScript: \r\n```\r\nif (ListContains(ScopeVisible(), )) {\r\n  msg (\"You give the random thing to whatsherface.\") \r\n  RemoveObject (objectnamehere)\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n msg (\"This isn't the right person/There is no one around.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAgain, this is a very simplistic way to handle this. If the person is in the room with the player the first message will appear, if they are not, then the second message will appear. \r\n\r\n**3)** So start with the _room.object_ that has the exit (this means you need to create an exit with the _Exit Tab_ as well into another room). On the _Exit Tab_ you'll see a grid of boxes that turn blue when you click them (these represent the physical exits of your room). Look below those boxes and you'll see \"Add\" etc and your room's exit. Double click the name of your exit (not the box) or you can find the exit on your tree of stuff below your room name. You should see three tabs: **Exit Options Attributes**\r\n\r\nScroll down and find the Locked Box. Check it. After that, write the message you want that will run when the player tries to exit without the item in question. Next, check \"Run A Script\" which is right below it. \r\nScript to Add.\r\n```\r\nif (Got (itemnamehere)) {\r\n  MoveObject (player, newroomnamehere)\r\n} \r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You need to find that darn item first.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps! If you need anymore help just ask :) \r\n\r\nAnonynn",
