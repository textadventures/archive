Instead of a timer, why not use a sound file?\n\nSo, record an mp3 sound file, in this case, make it silent, for the period of time you want it to run. Once you've done that, get a message/whatever form your writing should be in, then chuck in 'play sound file.' Put that 'silent' sound file recorded earlier in, and set the 'wait for sound to finish before continuing' switch to yes. Then add the next message, and etc.\n\nThis is quite an inefficient solution, but it might work. I dunno, I'm a noob, and I'm a bit young to be understanding scripts and long code things.\n\nCheers, Odie.",
