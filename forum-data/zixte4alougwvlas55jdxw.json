The plan is to make tutorials per section/topic area instead of piling all together as it currently is.\r\n\r\nI copy-pasted code from 7 rooms over to a new game and tried to switch over to test it and what I feared would happen, happened... Go figure.\r\n\r\nI got the following error when trying to switch over to the GUI.  Invalid XML:  The object start tag on line 435, position 4 does not match the end tag of asl line 669, position 3.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I know the problem, but is there any way to search code by line number without counting 669 lines of code?!  Or is there a specific 'something' I can type in the search bar to help locate the faulty line?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

I never did find the error (after counting all the lines lol), but it would make sense that I never found it if Quest counts wrap around lines as one line.

If that makes sense?!\r\n\r\nI am going to start a thread on the Feedback Forum about the revised tutorial.  I would appreciate it if you could copy-paste your applicable comments over to that thread.  Thanks a ton!",

It will have a warning about no style information, but should display what it can in a hierarchy like you normally see on the left. Scroll to the end, and you will see an error where the XML is wrong and the browser gave up trying to understand it. This should show you where the error is and what it is too.",
