      "EditableText": "I want to make a game, but I want to allow others to contribute themselves or to mod it later on.  Is there a way to make 100 rooms with exits and descriptions, etc. and lock them in place so that those can not be changed, but then allow others to make extra rooms to it?\r\n\r\nSo if there was a  street with store fronts, but I only had three active stores, someone else could make two more active or even an alley that was off limits, is now able to be entered.  They did not change the fundamentals to the game, as in make it on a space ship all of a sudden or made it a desert area, they only added to what was already preexisting.\r\n\r\nAnd the existing NPCs would not be able to be deleted, but new NPCs could show up if the other creators chose to so that the stores would be usable, is that also possible?  I guess in the end anything can be reworked, but I am speaking more of not easily changed, for both game play purposes and by others who may of deleted something by mistake or changed something they had not realized and have no way to fix it.  And also for me to create a blue print so others can enjoy and tweak I suppose.  Thank you.",
