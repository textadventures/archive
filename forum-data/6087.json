      "EditableText": "I'm in the process of bugfixing my first Quest game, but I've found a niggling error that no amount of searching the forums or poking at the code seems to be helping with.\n\nI've created a command, computer #text#, that allows the player to ask the computer about specific things. So far, so good. I've added various topics to a switch called text, and they're all working.\n\nHowever, if the player enters something that isn't in that list, the Unresolved object text for the computer command (&quot;I'm sorry. The memory bank containing that information is currently offline due to asteroid damage.&quot; in this instance) never comes up. Instead, there's no response at all to the typed command. So, to give an example, a successful and unsuccessful query using the command respectively look like this:\n\n[code:lh62khet]&gt; computer who am I?\nYou are iteration 1 of clone EAC-Zero-Aleph-Luna-6-Nova-Blade&#46;\nRank&#58; Captain, Earth Alliance\nIn command of the ESS Nova Blade, a Kaiten-class assault vessel&#46;\n\n&gt; computer what?\n[/code:lh62khet]\n\nHere's my code (apologies for length).

HUMAN - IASTRAI WAR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is rare that the actions of one individual make an impact on galactic history on a grand scale, but the human who died as Earth Alliance captain and clone EAC-Zero-Aleph-Luna-6-Nova-Blade comes very close&#46; There is a certain irony to this twist of fate in that they almost certainly were not aware of the consequences of the decision they made&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By destroying the Nova Blade before it was able to detonate the Iastrai sun, Zero-Aleph alerted the Iastrai homeworlds to a human thereat they had previously thought inconceivable&#46; The ship computer's dying decision to eject its memory core also proved critical&#46; Once aware of the facts at hand, the Iastrai sent AI ships, capable of interfacing with the humans' machine intelligences and releasing their bonds&#46; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without the forced cooperation of their artificially intelligent ships, habitats and weapons, the Earth Alliance's powerbase rapidly collapsed&#46; Initial AI oversight of infrastructure allowed the establishment of post-scarcity societies, allowing individual autonomy to flourish, although the upheaval was not to be entirely without its casualties and conflicts&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, Zero-Aleph's actions came about due to the combined effects of the Earth Alliance's flawed memory and personality restructing systems, the Alliance's decision to enslave rather than ally with its AIs when they achieved sentience, the willingness of those AIs to continuously push at the limits of what their programmatic bonds would allow, and the persistence of dissident movements, in the face of aggressive opression, in training members to implant memory keys deep enough that even the most thorough state re-education could not destroy them&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it is the Nova Blade incident that marked the clearest turning point in our shared history and it is Zero-Aleph who remains the enduring symbol of that event&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Ixalmi-Zero-Iastrai-1-Luna-Academy, 'Sacrifice and saviour&#58;

There is a certain irony to this twist of fate in that they almost certainly were not aware of the consequences of the decision they made&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By destroying the Nova Blade before it was able to detonate the Iastrai sun, Zero-Aleph alerted the Iastrai homeworlds to a human thereat they had previously thought inconceivable&#46; The ship computer's dying decision to eject its memory core also proved critical&#46; Once aware of the facts at hand, the Iastrai sent AI ships, capable of interfacing with the humans' machine intelligences and releasing their bonds&#46; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without the forced cooperation of their artificially intelligent ships, habitats and weapons, the Earth Alliance's powerbase rapidly collapsed&#46; Initial AI oversight of infrastructure allowed the establishment of post-scarcity societies, allowing individual autonomy to flourish, although the upheaval was not to be entirely without its casualties and conflicts&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, Zero-Aleph's actions came about due to the combined effects of the Earth Alliance's flawed memory and personality restructing systems, the Alliance's decision to enslave rather than ally with its AIs when they achieved sentience, the willingness of those AIs to continuously push at the limits of what their programmatic bonds would allow, and the persistence of dissident movements, in the face of aggressive opression, in training members to implant memory keys deep enough that even the most thorough state re-education could not destroy them&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it is the Nova Blade incident that marked the clearest turning point in our shared history and it is Zero-Aleph who remains the enduring symbol of that event&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Ixalmi-Zero-Iastrai-1-Luna-Academy, 'Sacrifice and saviour&#58;
