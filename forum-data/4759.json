I lay awake for hours last night, going over my game, when I suddenly realised there was a logic issue that I'm struggling to resolve.\n\nAt one of my locations, the character is stood outside a shop (this is a location that is used more than once, as the player branches off in one of three directions, and may return). From here, he can enter the shop, find a way up to a church at the top of a hill, or return to his car.\n\nThe problem I have is that when the player is at the 'church' location, he is joined by the woman from the shop, who asks him why he's really there. This is a follow up to their conversation in the shop, and is only logical if the player has entered the shop before going up to the church. If he bypasses the shop and goes straight up to the church first, this meeting of the woman will be his first and won't make any sense.\n\nHow would I make it so that the game knows whether or not he's been in the shop, so that if he visits the church before entering the shop, I can give a slightly different description.\n\nI suspect it'll require the use of a flag and/or some script, but I really don't know the first thing about using them.\n\nI'm not asking for people to do it for me, but I really need step by step instructions like: \n\nClick on the location &gt;&gt; Change the 'text' dropdown to 'text &amp; script' &gt;&gt; Click Add a script &gt;&gt; Choose the 'if' script &gt;&gt; etc &gt;&gt; etc &gt;&gt; etc",

Basically on the shop page I would use the  add new script button and use the &quot;set flag on&quot; selection under variables. Then after flag name just type what you want the flag to be called. then on the pages where the player talks to the shopkeeper use the add new script button to select &quot;if&quot; under functions and set it to &quot;if flag is on&quot; and type the flag name from before (case sensitive) and then click the add new function button in the same box as the if function. (just bellow where it says &quot;then&quot;) and use the &quot;print message&quot; selection. You can do the same for &quot;if flag is off&quot; for her dialog if the character hasn't been in her shop. you can also use &quot;character has seen page&quot; selection under if in the shop... but there isn't a &quot;character hasn't seen page&quot; option... you can also set links to new pages this way.",
