Its based around the Feudal Age, so it will have all the feudal weapons and armor etc, and ive mixed in some fantasy classes like battlemages, and wizards, just to spice things up a bit, and ill be working on the client interface soon  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
