There was a slide down arrow and i checked what was there. I decided look at the default verbs, to see what it would offer. Nothing special happened. Only the &quot;click save and then reload&quot; yellow bar. After a while, i got tired of that bar, saved the game and reloaded. Now the game does not loads anymore.\n\nError adding type 'defaultverb' to element 'k4'\n\nIs there a way to recover my previous work or should i restart all the process?",
