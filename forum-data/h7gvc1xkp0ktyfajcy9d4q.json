How can I check where it was before it was taken?\r\n\r\nThere are two scripts you can put on an object. `ontake` is run *after* an object is taken; while `take` is run *instead of* the default take behaviour.\r\n\r\nIf you give the object a `take` script, you can check what container it is in. You just need to remember to add the object to the player's inventory afterwards.\r\n\r\nSo you could either move your existing script to the `take` script, or give it a simple `take` script:\r\n```\r\nthis.takenfrom = this.parent\r\nAddToInventory (this)\r\n```\r\nwhich adds an attribute `takenfrom` to store where the player is taking it from.",
