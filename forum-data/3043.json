This is currently not possible with the current build of Quest, and I want to know why.\n\nNow before you give me alternatives like:\n\n1. You can just share it as a .quest file extension\nor\n2. Share it on the website!\nI have to tell you\n1. I don't want people to download a second program to play the game.\nand\n2. I don't want to share it on the website. \n\nSo, if there's anything out there, a quest to exe converter or something let me now. Thank you all in advance!",
