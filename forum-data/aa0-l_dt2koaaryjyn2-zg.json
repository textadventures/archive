I'm thinking there could be a way to add a command that does an eval, so that you can for example add flags to objects to access stuff later in the game.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, do you play through your game hundreds of times just when making a small game? Or do you write a text-file with all commands up to the point you want to test?",
