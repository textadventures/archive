      "EditableText": "That sounds correct. I'm assuming that you went back into your editor and pressed \"BUILD\" to regenerate the files. Then you should just do the zip, including the directory it is in (best to name that folder the same thing as your game name). \r\n\r\nAnyway, that's how I do it. Just zip up from the folder level and upload to squiffy.\r\n\r\n",
