And then I guess when the player types drop sand, you could make them drop the sand object and set their sand attribute to 0.",

      "EditableText": "The problem is that Quest does object name resolution in a strictly syntactic way, without paying attention to any sort of semantic information. (I'm not dissing Quest - it's not an easy problem to solve.) It will go through the same process for &quot;drop&quot; as it does for &quot;take&quot;, and this object name resolution happens long before the verb or command kicks in. So even changing DoDrop won't fix the problem - the disambiguation menu happens before it even gets to the command.\n\nBasically, if you give the name &quot;sand&quot; to your &quot;clawful of sand&quot;, then you have two sand objects in the same room, period, and there's no way around that short of hacking the parser to special case this situation (in a way I haven't explored, so I can't offer any insight yet).\n\nThe only suggestion I have is to have the sand in the room disappear (or become hidden) when you pick it up. Then the sand in your inventory will take precedence, which means you need to have all the same behavior for that sand (e.g. the look text) as it does when in the room. So you can still look at the sand and all that, but it's now looking at the one in your inventory. If it has the same description, it will be indistinguishable behavior to the player.  I did a test where, when you pick up the clawful of sand, it sets the &quot;visible&quot; flag of the floor sand to false, as well as adding the alias &quot;sand&quot; to the clawful one. It might be worth a try, just to see if it's close to what you want done.",

This could give you a descriptive feedback you'll want.  Also, could you add a command like 'get sand; get floor; take floor; etc; etc' and add a script to that which moves 'clawful of sand' to your inventory from your 'holdingroom''?  The add a script which moves 'drop sand' to 'holdingroom' again.  You could just add to the in-room description the seeming presence of the sandy/dirty floor so the player recognizes it as relevant.  Just thinking out loud... I've never tried to add a command for built-in Quest commands like take and drop.\n\n^Of course, you would have to throw in your 'If' commands to your take/drop command to check if player is carrying sand already.\n\nGot bored and just tried it out.
