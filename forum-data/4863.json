I don't get it when I try it, and no one else mentioned it.\n\n'Take gun' should work, but it's only cos you (for whatever reason) are already carrying it that it doesn't. I have a whole range of various commands for getting hold of the gun.\n\nWhen you say the timer didn't work. Did it seem like 6 seconds before the goon shot you? If it did, then it's working as intended.\n\nThe biggest surprise to me is that you don't think it's obvious that you need to shoot the goon. To get to that stage, you've already snatched the gun from his desk, and then when the goon bursts in, the final sentence is &quot;He's armed and starts to raise his weapon.&quot; How is it not obvious that 'shoot goon' is the next, logical command?\n\nThis is why writing good IF is so difficult... knowing how other players will react is impossible to determine. It seems so obvious to me that 'shoot goon' is the next command, but then that's maybe because I knew that's what I wanted to do.\n\n[quote=&quot;Silver&quot;:2lf2z72n]Apart from that, I enjoyed the writing![/quote:2lf2z72n]\nThanks <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
