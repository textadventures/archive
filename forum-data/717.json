      "EditableText": "I've been thinking of taking a break from my normal RPG/fantasy/puzzle style games to make a skim-reading, quick-typing sheer madness action-style shoot 'em up. The basic idea would be you and between 1 to 5 computers (teams would be allowed of course) run around a huge abadoned military complex with the only purpose being to kill everyone else not on your team. There would be various weaponry from handguns (point and shoot) to mines (next person to enter the room... BOOM) to knifes (no ammo problems, but weak). These, armour, ammo and a few misc items (first-aid kits, aiming sights for improved accuracy etc.) would be scattered randomly the 40 or so rooms. Of course there would be some special objects such security cameras, with screens in other rooms to view enemy locations (unless the camera got shot of course), old oil tankers that could explode and destroy the whole room, and probably everyone in it, walkways that could be shot at from a room below... you get the point. All this would of course be in real time with ammo-fire rates, vulnerable periods when fleeing a room and reload times. \n\nNow this all fine in theory of course, but doing all this in Quest... would be difficult to say the least. The weapons, armour and shooting shouldn't be hard to do (I've done similiar things before, though not with guns of course). Creating the battle-ground would be easy. However there are some things I'm not too sure off. How, for example, would I manage to get the computer to move around, wear the best armour, shoot enemies etc. Sure, I can think of ways to do these, but all which involve large chunks of code that would cause Quest to hang for a second or two, which would ruin the action. Another problem is all the minor details that would be required: For example say the player has just entered an old oil storage from the north. An enemy is in there, and both he and the computer shoot. Not only would all the normal code for accuracy, weapon type, armour, damage, wounds... but you'd have to check when a bullet misses if it would hit the oil cans or not, plus where the player had come from so that the player couldn't flee further north past the computer without taking much longer...\n\nAnyone got any ideas about this?",
