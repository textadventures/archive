      "EditableText": "So lets say you have a cup with 500ml of water. In order to take some but not all of that water you first need a second container to put that water into (assuming fairly normal circumstances of course). Then  when the player does the action to take water from the first cup into their container, you remove the set amount from the cup and add it to the amount contained in the players container.\n\nAs for the setup, I would personally create an attribute on a container type object for whatever is contained, as an example I'll name the attribute &quot;holding&quot; and it will be a string since we just want a name to list whats inside our cup. So in this case [b:4o8plgg3]Cup.holding = &quot;water&quot;[/b:4o8plgg3]. Now you need a second attribute for the amount being held, I'll just call this &quot;volume&quot;, so then [b:4o8plgg3]Cup.volume = 500[/b:4o8plgg3]. You want just a number here, you can add the labels such as 'ml' in the description and such. If you add any letters it will treat it as a word and not a number value.\n\nTo take part of the contents you'll need to create a verb on the cup to take the contents and not the cup itself, how much flexibility you want to give the player (ie: enter any number vs pick from some options) is up to you. Then when you remove the selected amount, you then add that to the volume of the player's container.",
