In 5.2 I could add to the verbs in an object commands like [color=#BF0000:2aejbghb]turn;twist;spin;rotate[/color:2aejbghb] etc etc but in 5.4 for some reason it ignores the other verbs after the first semi-colon and does not place it in the verbs tree list on the left hand side. Can someone explain this please.
