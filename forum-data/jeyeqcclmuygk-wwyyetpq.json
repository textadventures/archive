Quest games are compiled as **.quest** files, which can only be played in the desktop version of Quest (for Windows only) or in Quest's online player on this site.

So, a few HTML tricks don't work.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf one were to take the time to make a Quest text adventure that looks and acts like a gamebook, that might be worth the while, but the player would still need Quest for Windows or to play on this site, and the Quest player on this site is not even almost as dependable as the Squiffy games.  (I think the Quest games are on a different server than the HTML games.  The Quest server sucks when it works, and it frequently crashes.)\r\n\r\nI am more of a Quest guy than a Squiffy guy.  I've made gamebooks in Quest, and I've made text adventures that look and behave like gamebooks in Quest.

      "EditableText": "Richard,\r\n\r\nI appreciate your assessment. I read some of the quest documentation and really decided it wasn't how I wanted to build my next game. They even said that the Quest gamebook is the worst of all worlds.

Not sure. The four-space indented stuff). One has to be very careful with that and write and build in small chunks. If something fails and you've just spooled out 100 lines of code, good luck finding it. \r\n\r\nBut still, yes, Squiffy suits my game development ideals.",
