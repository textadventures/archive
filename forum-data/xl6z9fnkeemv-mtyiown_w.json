You could do something like:\r\n```\r\nif (IsDefined (\"oldvalue\")) {\r\n  damage = this.LIFE_C - oldvalue\r\n  if (HasString (this, \"damage_message\")) {\r\n    if (not this.damage_message = \"\") {\r\n      damage = \"\" + Abs(damage)\r\n      AddLogMessage (Replace (this.damage_message, \"!\", damage))\r\n    }\r\n    this.damage_message = null\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    if (damage < 0) {\r\n      AddLogMessage (\"You healed \" + (0 - damage) + \"damage.\")\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      AddLogMessage (\"You took \" + damage + \"damage.\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way, you can do something like:\r\n```\r\ngame.pov.LIFE_C = game.pov.LIFE_C - 10\r\n```\r\nand it generates the message automatically;\r\n\r\nor you could do:\r\n```\r\ngame.pov.damage_message = \"You burned yourself and took # damage.\"\r\ngame.pov.LIFE_C = game.pov.LIFE_C - GetRandomInt(2,4)\r\n```\r\nto get a more specific message\r\n\r\nor for slow damage like fatigue:\r\n```\r\ngame.pov.damage_message = \"\"\r\ngame.pov.LIFE_C = game.pov.LIFE_C - 1\r\n```\r\nstops a message from appearing for that specific damage type.",

So you need 2 values for arithmetic, and a combined one for the status attribute.\r\n\r\nThere's no need to duplicate an attribute unless there is something different.\r\n\r\nAs you'll see in my example of how you could use a list for the status log, there's a separate variable for the status pane: because `game.pov.logmessages` is a list of the last 20 messages, and `game.pov.LOG` is a string containing the last 3 messages (status attributes cannot be lists; but there's nothing to stop you putting more than one line of text in them)\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you wanted to, you could set up the whole status pane with a single status attribute.\r\nIn the list of status attributes, you'd put a single attribute, key `STATUS` and value `!`\r\nAnd then have a turnscript:\r\n```\r\ngame.text_processor_this = game.pov\r\ngame.pov.STATUS = ProcessText (\"Health: {this.LIFE_Current} / {this.LIFE_Max}<br/>Hunger: {this.HUNGER_Current} / {this.HUNGER_Max}<br/>{if this.POISON > 0:You are poisoned<br/>}Add more data here…\")\r\n```\r\nThis method would have the advantage that you can easily have attributes that disappear when not needed (like only showing the \"ammo\" line when the player has a gun)",
