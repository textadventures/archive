      "EditableText": "You can change everything about an object by changing its attributes. For example, you could do something like:\r\n```\r\nvase.alias = \"broken vase\"\r\nvase.look = \"a pretty vase with a big crack in it\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also change an object's verbs. For example:\r\n```\r\nvase.fill = \"You can't fill a broken vase.\"\r\nvase.repair => {\r\n    // put a script here to add a verb\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you add or remove verbs, you should also change the attribute `generatedverbslist`, which is used to determine which verbs to show on the pop up menu. For example:\r\n```\r\nlist remove (vase.generatedverbslist, \"fill\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n<h2>But…</h2>\r\nIf you're making a lot of changes at once, it might be easier making a separate object for the broken vase. Put it in a location the player can't get to, and when the vase gets broken just swap them around.",
