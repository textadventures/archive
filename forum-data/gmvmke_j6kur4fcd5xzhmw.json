I've been using set variable and it doesn't seem too work.\r\n\r\nWhat I want for clarity purposes is a player to start with a strength stat of say 5, and then when they interact with an object, that variable goes up by 1 * a multiplier of sorts.\r\n\r\nIf someone can point me where I can control integers and then use if statements with them, like if the strength stat is under 5, don't let the player do x, that'd be great.",
