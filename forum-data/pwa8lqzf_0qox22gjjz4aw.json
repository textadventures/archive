I was going about my game-making business, looking for a YouTube to mp3 audio cutter, when I came across [this website.](https://youtube-cutter.org/) It turns out, this website generates a link for your audio file! What you need to do is paste a YT link, cut it to your desired length (if you don't want to cut it, just put the start point at the start of the video and the endpoint at the end,) MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT SELECTED TO MP3, converting it, and then click download. It doesn't download it, instead, it plays it in an HTML player! Hope this helps anyone who's having the same issue as I was.",
