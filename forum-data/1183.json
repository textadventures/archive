In IE it renders right.  If I make DIV height 100%, then IE renders IFRAME to large and bottom scroll arrow goes off page.  I need to keep IFRAME at height as now, but make it work in other browsers.  I want to make it expandable for different screen resolutions, so I'm using percentages instead of px, em, etc.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\n\n-Witch Wyzwurd",
