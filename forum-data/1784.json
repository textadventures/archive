It's designed for multiplayer use, but can be changed for single player. It only has basic melee attacking with a weapon, no ranged weapons, it does also have a leveling system. Monsters can attack each other and gain experience and levels just like players too.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on my game for the Yuletide comp though, after Christams I'll be working on HavenHold getting the battle codes finished and all nice. If you're interested, I can also make a single player version or simpily it for what you need?",
