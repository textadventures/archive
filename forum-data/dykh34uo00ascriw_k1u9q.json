Well, I recently downloaded Quest and I might think it could help me to be an _Indie Game Developer_.\r\nBut, I am so curious that yeah... You could publish the games on textadventures.co.uk you've been created on Quest.\r\n\r\nBut, What I want is to Publish games I created on Quest **_ON_** Game Hosting Sites or Either on **Steam**.\r\n\r\nCould you tell me How can I make my games created in Quest in _.exe_ format in order to Publish/Sell my Game on Steam or Other Game Hosting Sites. I hope someone answers... Thanks!",
