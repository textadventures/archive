People then start up Quest, click the network tab and enter in the host's ip address, the ports being used, etc and press connect. Quest then connects to Questnet running on the host's computer and downloads all the stuff about the game. Quest tells Questnet what it's doing so things done in game effect everyone's game.\n\nProgramming a multiplayer game isn't too hard, only slight differences are needed. You can even make a single player game then host it as multiplayer anyways. Some multiplayer games can be played single player striaght through Quest, but it usually warns you some things may not work if you do that. My game, HavenHold doesn't work single player and must be laoded through Questnet for testing. It uses an add-on engine for Quest eveloped my me which stores player's info to their username and not an id number which gets used by the next person to log on after you've gone.",
