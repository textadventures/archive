      "EditableText": "I read in the forum, that someone is missing zones and moving objects. Here is my solution for doing something like this. You need to copy 2 functions to your game ( countChar and getRoom) and the procedure moveObjects, which must be called in the Game/Advanced script command &quot;After each turn&quot;\n\nEvery room within a zone must get the property &quot;zone&quot; with the name of the rooms, the object can walk to from here (comma-list).\n\nObjects must have 2 properties: \nmove=1 says, that the Object should move\nmove_percent=55    is the probability, that the object moves\n\n\nAlex, I hope, Q5 will have a better editor. Its not possible to handle procedures like this in Q4",

They don't open in a pop-up window - instead the &quot;then&quot; or whatever appears within the editor. Things could still get a little cramped when you've got a lot of nested scripts though, so you can always &quot;pop out&quot; an editor.\n\nYou can take a look now by building the latest source from <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest.codeplex.com\">http://quest.codeplex.com</a><!-- m --> - it still needs a lot of fleshing out and refining of course.\n\nI'm also planning to embed a text editor so you can code by hand, swapping back and forth between the visual view and the code view.",
