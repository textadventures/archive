Of course it can get annoying, but most of the time, it's done because either don't know better, or want to poke harmless fun at others.\r\n\r\nI'm german, and thusly not exactly gifted with the best stereotypes in the world. You either must grow a thick skin when confronted with them, or consider them as a persiflage of your culture. If you can laugh at yourself, that's a healthy bit of self-reflection.\r\n\r\nAnd considering conspiracy theories... i never heard of that one, but there might be an \"X isn't real\" theory for just about everything in existence. Finland has one too. The tough that 99.9% of people aren't complete imbeciles might cheer you up.",
