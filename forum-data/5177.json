Friends, family, and students have read the work so far and have liked it, but again... not sure if they would say if they didn't.

This book sucks,&quot; without fear of awkward encounters later!\n\nThe book is probably classified as a 'supernatural thriller' along the lines of Dean Koontz and, at last check, is about 20000-25000 words (or by my best estimates about 30% of a typical novel).  \n\nIf you are interested, I can easily direct it your way.  Remember though, that I want honesty.  I'm not really looking for an editor so only general advice on grammar are requested.  I'm rather looking for opinions on the story, development of the characters, and writing style in general.\n\nThanks and hope to hear from you soon.\n\nHappy Gaming!",
