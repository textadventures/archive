I want to make it so that a character can step into a time machine and go back in time.\n\nThere are three buttons that need to be pressed, in the correct order. That's not a problem, I've figured out how to do that using flags and conditions.\n\nThe problem is, the buttons are named &quot;red button&quot;, &quot;blue button&quot; and &quot;green button&quot;. When I specify a custom command of 'press #@red button#', etc, I get the same response every time I type 'press (colour) button', no matter which colour I have put in.\n\nIf I don't include the #@__#, then it works fine, only it means that it can be done from anywhere in the game, not just in the room containing the time machine. That doesn't really work out.\n\nCan somebody tell me why this is happening and how I can fix it?",
