I know in China, due to the one child policy and boys were preferred over girls, the men greatly outnumber the women at this point, so the women can really be choosy in who they want to be with.  Apparently there is a day or a ritual where the guys will bring flowers to a woman(s) (it's like an actual place with tables and chairs) and the woman can accept or refuse the flowers of the person giving them to her.  Taking them means she wants you and refusing them means... well she refuses you.\r\n\r\nAnd in Japan there is a practice of obligation chocolates, where the women give chocolates to everyone, but that does not mean they actually like you that way and is more of a \"Hey don't feel so bad, eat some chocolate\" type of thing.  ^^!\r\n\r\nIt is common practice, although not sure it is for every Muslim man, to have up to four wives.  I am not sure if certain countries just over rule that or not, but it is or was quite common at one point.  Of course the wife could only have one husband and a whole slew of reasons followed why, but I am not going to get into all that here.",
