      "EditableText": "Hi guys, I've hit another issue that's really weird.\n\nI've been working on a Game.aslx that has a Music.mp3 playing on loop in the background as a BGM. I wanted to also include room transition sounds and so I used the following code to play .ogg files with a &quot;Print Expression&quot;:\n\n&quot;&lt;audio src=\\&quot;&quot; + GetFileURL(&quot;Door Open 1.ogg&quot;) + &quot;\\&quot; autoplay&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&quot;\n\nThat works fine, and I can publish the game into a Game.quest and the audio goes over just fine.\n\n---\n\nFast forward to today, I created a new blank project to test out a new mechanic i wanted to add into the game. This one plays a series of timed messages synchronized to an audio track that starts when you type &quot;Play Media&quot;.\n\nI used the same command as above to play the .ogg files, and it works fine when i test the game in Game2.aslx, but when I publish the file to Game2.quest, I noticed that the .ogg files no longer play. I've tried making sure that they're in the same folder and all but it just doesn't seem to work - which confuses me because i can't see what i'm doing differently with both Game.aslx and Game2.aslx. If it works with the first why doesn't it work with the other?",
