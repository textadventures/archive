We have our ingredients and utensils in our inventory\n\nBlue Dye\nYellow Dye\nFlour\nWater\nCooking Pot\nSpoon\nMeasuring Cup\n\nIn the room is a stove\n\nWe have read, or hold, the recipe which states\n\n&quot;for a blue-green colour, mix 2 drops blue dye and 1 drop yellow dye to 5 parts water and 5 parts flour&quot;\n\nand a method which states\n\n&quot;for an even hue to be obtained, first the dyes must be mixed with cold water, then the flour can be mixed in and the whole mixture heated for 10 minutes&quot;\n\nAs I said above - I am not dealing with the measures side of things (although a measuring cup is required in the inventory), as I hope to have the ingredients and containers in such a way that even though an ingredient is re-used, it is done so in a different container, thus making it easier to decide which concoction is being produced.\n\nWith that in mind, and the above example we have 2 options.\n\nWe can simply type MAKE BLUE-GREEN PAINT as we have all the requisite items and know the recipe.\n\nOR\n\nWe can go through a list of commands\n\nPUT WATER IN POT- You place 5 measures of WATER in the COOKING POT.\nPUT BLUE DYE IN POT - You place 2 drops of BLUE DYE in the COOKING POT.\nPUT YELLOW DYE IN POT - You place 1 drop of YELLOW DYE in the COOKING POT.\nSTIR POT - You mix the liquid until the water turns an even blue-green colour.\nPUT FLOUR IN POT - You place place 5 measures of FLOUR in the COOKING POT\nSTIR POT - You mix the flour into the blue-green water until an even consistency is reached.\nPUT POT ON STOVE - You place the COOKING POT on the STOVE and gently heat it for ten minutes.\nTAKE POT - You take the COOKING POT.\nEXAMINE POT - The COOKING POT contains some BLUE-GREEN PAINT.\n\nNow that list of steps is not too dissimilar to some of the recipes I am planning.\n\nAt present, I have several USE X on Y combinations, and about 6 recipes, 1 or 2 of which have many steps.\n\nWould you rather follow a list of instructions?  Or would you rather simply type MAKE X?\n\nWhich do you feel would provide the better gameplay?\n\nWould you also like to add in the measurements?  I decided against them due to excess tedium, repetition and the fact that if people make a mistake they would have to start the recipe from scratch.\n\nPlease note:\nI only plan on having the player collect, harvest, produce each ingredient item once.\nI only plan on having the player produce each recipe once.\nOnce all recipes for which an ingredient can be used in have been completed, that ingredient will disappear from the players inventory.\n\nYou opinions are greatly valued, I hope I haven't rambled too much.\n\np.s. the above example was something I dreamt up for this topic so as not to give away an secrets of my game until I am ready to do so.\n\nThank you.",
