One of them tells me to go to point B and click a link. When I return to place A again, suddenly boom, 4 options. \r\nBut not until I have clicked the link in point B. \r\n\r\nOr like having encounters that award the player with a certain number of points. And until he has reached that number, he cannot proceed to go to point B. But needs to collect some more at point A and C to proceed. \r\n\r\nThat is conditions, right? \r\n\r\nI am not sure. Is there a way to work these into the game? I have no knowledge of programming whatsoever, save the [[]]: stuff that I have done with squiffy so far. So I am afraid I would require babysteps again, if possible. \r\n\r\nIs that actually possible in squiffy?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance. The last answer really helped me a great deal and I am looking forward to an answer again. Thank you for reading. ",
