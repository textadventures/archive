I haven't been on here in a while, but wow, look at this thread!!! \n\nOk, firstly, I don't think anyone takes this thread seriously. Someone posted a question about if people really hate each-other, and all I can say, is that if you REALLY hate some guy on a message board that you don't even know because they, get ready......said a MEAN THING to you, (wah, mommie!!) than you have got serious problems. This is all fun for me. The \"rivalry\" (if we can even call it that) between zelimos and david is fake. Please; they don't really hate each other. They probably LIKE having arguments. \n\nNow, I have a problem with one of zelimos' comments: [quote:2j1b9h9l]i don't care what a bunch of skinny american nerds say about me [/quote:2j1b9h9l] HELLO!!! Haven't you heard!!?? Americans are more obese than EVER right now!!! So that would NOT be an insult. (BTW, I am an american, and **SHOCK, GASP** I also happen to b skinny. But that's beside the point.)\n\nAs for 007Bond, ok: I usually try to not say negative things, and I try to keep my comments to myself, but I need to say something here. I wasn't here by the whole \"codingmasters\" incident, but even [b:2j1b9h9l][u:2j1b9h9l]I[/b:2j1b9h9l][/u:2j1b9h9l] know that that was you. Come off it. And you can (and almost always usually are) be extremely smart-alecky and annoying. Listen: you are a 12? 13? year old kid, trying to wise off to a bunch of older guys, giving unwanted advice, trying to look super-smart, and thowing in a bunch of nonsensical high-tech vocabulary words to try and sound \"smart.\" FYI. It makes you sound dumb. And like a 12? 13? year old kid. \n\nAnd for my last comment.....I like davidrw's sarcastic replies. Unlike most people's responses, they are actually witty. Usually. And the funniest thing about him? I can tell from the context of his replies that he OBVIOUSLY doesn't give a f*** about this \"fight,\" and does it for fun. In the meantime, everyone else here is getting all twisted up all over everything. So, my advice: Chill out, people. Ok. Now that I am done, I can't wait for all of the hate comments to start flying.
