      "EditableText": "I have a container (a sack).  The max objects that the sack can hold is 1, and the max volume it can hold is 500.  There are two \"Full container messages\" -- one for max number of objects (sack.containermaxobjects), and one for max volume of objects (sack.containerfullmessage).  I have different text messages for each.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that only the max volume of objects message will display (and for both instances).  I.e., if the sack contains 1 100-volume object, and I put another 100-volume object in there (for a total volume of 200 out of 500 max), the max VOLUME of objects message will display, instead of the max NUMBER of objects message (2 objects is over the limit of 1).  WTHeck?  I tried reversing the messages, but the problem persists.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug in Quest, or it just bugging me?",
