If you set things up like that, not too hard but definitely not as easy as I make it sound, your timer counting down each second will just have to check that each fireball in the game is moved 2 meters closer to it's destination at each tick of the clock.\r\n\r\nNow making it so that destination is a fixed place in a virtual room space is a little more difficult and requires some outside of the box thinking.

Just as a rotten banana will not improve the reception on my television set.  \n- Sit down and come up with a story of some sort.  Short or long, just make sure there is a purpose for playing.\n- Watch your spelling, grammar and punctuation when creating your game.\n- Come up with some interesting puzzles for players to figure out (player finds rotten banana and uses it on tv set...nevermind)\n- Test your game.  Fix any errors.\n- Once you think you're done, have someone test your game.  Fix the errors they find.\n- Test your game again.  Satisfied?  Now upload your game and watch positive reviews come in...with any luck.  <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif\" alt=\":mrgreen:\" title=\"Mr. Green\" /><!-- s:mrgreen: -->",
