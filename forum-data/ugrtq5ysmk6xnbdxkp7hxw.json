I don't think it would keep quest up and ever-increasing the memory usage (aka: a memory leak), but I could be wrong, as this is way out of my league of knowledge with computers.\r\n\r\nin simplicity, here's an example of an infinite loop (infinite loops ARE BAD! this will crash quest):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n  <game name=\"xxx\">\r\n    <attr name=\"start\" type=\"script\">\r\n      boolean_variable = true\r\n      while (boolean_variable) {\r\n        msg (\"hi\")\r\n      }\r\n    </attr>\r\n  </game>\r\n  <object name=\"room\">\r\n    <object name=\"player\">\r\n    </object>\r\n  </object>\r\n</asl>\r\n\r\n// output:\r\n//\r\n// hi\r\n// hi\r\n// hi\r\n// hi hi hi hi hi hi hi, on and on, forever.... except quest and/or your computer doesn't have infinite resources to display infinite 'hi's. While the looping is infinite, quest and/or your computer has FINITE resources (space/memory/etc), and so quest and/or your computer crashes\r\n```\r\n\r\nhere's how to NOT have the infinite loop (as infinite loops ARE VERY BAD! NEVER do an infinite loop! usually there's safeguards in place to protect you, but in the early days of computers --- you could make your computer unusable/destroyed from infinite loops, I think):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n  <game name=\"xxx\">\r\n    <attr name=\"start\" type=\"script\">\r\n      boolean_variable = true\r\n      while (boolean_variable) {\r\n        msg (\"hi\")\r\n        boolean_variable = false\r\n      }\r\n    </attr>\r\n  </game>\r\n  <object name=\"room\">\r\n    <object name=\"player\">\r\n    </object>\r\n  </object>\r\n</asl>\r\n\r\n// output:\r\n//\r\n// hi\r\n//\r\n// (only 1 'hi' occurs, as the condition is made false with its first, and thus, only run/execution of the 'while' Function):\r\n//\r\n// boolean_variable = true\r\n// so, since the condition for the 'while' Function is TRUE, the 'while' Function's content (displaying: hi, AND changing the 'boolean_variable' Variable's Value to now being: false --- see below) is executed.\r\n// boolean_variable = false\r\n// but now, the 'while Function's condition is FALSE, and so its contents are not executed, and thus no second 'hi' is displayed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nto check file's contents you need to have (or create your own) a software/program that can do so... which gets into whether it's legal or not. You can of course use anti-virus/malware software to check/scan the file for any malicious code... but they may not be effective... it depends on whether it's within the file itself (which requires a program or hacking/reverse-engineering on your part, again which gets into whether it's legal or not)",
