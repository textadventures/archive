I'm in middle of writing a game (The sex one) and it can be a little frustrating sometimes, but not too bad. If one way doesn't work, I program it another way. But as I look through these forums, it seems like everyone else is using the asl code to write their games. Am I the only one sing the visual editor? And if so, why? Asl takes so much typing, while this way is so fast. And if you say it's customizable (asl) well, I can pretty much do almost anything with the visual editor. Also, about &quot;Libraries&quot; I;m not too familiar. What are they exactly? Other user's custom made commands? And where can I get them? Thanks",

If you are used to programming, ASL is a more obvious way to work - it follows your way of working. If, like me, you have only a tiny bit of experience (from way back in DOS days) you might prefer to use the visual editor for most things and then tweak in ASL. If you have no programming experience and even HTML freaks you out, then the QDK is probably best.\n\nOf course, if you don't want to pay for the QDK, then ASL is the way to go since you don't have to pay for Quest - only Quest Pro inc. QDK.\n\nFrank",
