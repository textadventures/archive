I got it to create an up direction once somehow, but I can't figure out how to duplicate that and while it works from a plain text editor and loads into QDK, if I save it in QDK it seems to strip out part of the command.\n\nI only need this for a rope object I'm designing. My workaround is to make the players type \"climb rope\" instead of also allowing the rope to have an up or down direction (i.e. the rope has to be mobile so it would add and remove up and down directions based on where it's placed). \n\nI have the rope object working okay for \"climb rope\" and getting the player to another room, but it would be nice to have an up or down direction added/removed too. \n\nThen again maybe I could override the up and down commands to get around this (but it wouldn't help for players who want to click the up and down arrows on the direction buttons).",

      "EditableText": "Interesting.  I tried it and it worked fine for me even after I saved it in QDK.  Just to be clear here is what I did.  I use QDK to create rope that when used on a wall would create an exit to the north, and a corresponding exit to the south.  Then I closed QDK, opened the file in my text editor and changed north to up, and south to down, saved it, closed it, loaded it back in QDK and saved it again.  When I looked at the command in QDK it looked like I created a â€œgo toâ€ exit, but it still worked as an up or down.\n\nIâ€™m not sure but I think that your problem may be in your use of the #quest.currentroom# string variable.  When your player climbs the rope I assume you want to create an exit up from a specific location to a specific location and down again.  Why use the string?\n\nI might need to think about this problem some more.",

      "EditableText": "Okay. Figured out what's happening. Did like you said and make a north south exit, saved it in QDK, changed it in a text editor to up down. Works. Okay but now go back into QDK and open up the script command and click the \"okay\" button (even without changing anything), and save.... run the game... wipes it out. So I guess the QDK thinks it's invalid and wipes it out, but you can write the code in a text editor and Quest runs it. Weird.\n\nSo basically, if you do the up/down code you can't make changes to that within QDK or it'll get wiped out. That's what was happening apparently. I got it to work once, then changed a variable in QDK and saved, ran it, and it no longer worked... so I guess for up/down you have to do it all in a text editor.\n\nAs for the string... I was just being lazy and using it as as test. I won't use #quest.currentroom# in the final code. I'm going to have strings passed to the routine from object properties of a wall object (i.e. nextRoomStringTag=whatever) and then the \"use rope\"\n routine pulls that in and sends the player to the \"whatever\" room.",
