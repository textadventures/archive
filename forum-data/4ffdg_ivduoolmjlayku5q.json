      "EditableText": "The best way to write children at that age, in my opinion, is that they...\r\n1) Don't follow social norms. Meaning most of the time (depending on upbringing) they will call out the first physical attribute on someone that they see. ie, Big man, big woman, blonde lady, scary man, yucky cat, funny dog. Keep their vocabulary very simple and their sentences relatively short (unless they've had a particularly rich/privileged upbringing). \r\n2) Girls also tend to be a little more sensitive (again depending on personality). Like, if they got a new dress and it got wet, they'd probably cry about it. Boys will be focused on things they want or are comfortable with. Again, these can vary greatly depending on upbringing and the type of character that you want.\r\n3) They can usually focus on ONE thing at a time. For example, looking at a ball and then running into a wall, or looking at a cloud and then tripping. This makes playing games with them fun as they get completely immersed in what you're doing normally. And some children are extremely particular about getting their way.\r\n4) They also LOVE to laugh and they will laugh particularly hard, even at very silly things. \r\n5) Cling when they are scared, or want to be held/picked up particularly by their mom's and dad's.\r\n6) They tend to be very shy when meeting new people. \r\nCheck out some Miyazaki films; Ponyo, My Neighbor Totoro etc. \r\n\r\nFor your paragraph...\r\n\r\n2.Tarsi\r\n\r\nYou look over to the little child **((probably refer to gender here; little girl, little boy.

You certainly don't want to scare her. She doesn't even notice your approach. Seconds later, you call out to her hoping to get her attention, \"Excuse me! Hello!\" \r\n\r\nUpon hearing you and realizing you're talking to her, she immediately stops playing and then turns to face you looking slightly confused. You can see her study you momentarily before she finally takes a step forward in your direction, but naturally she keeps her distance.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Mr. You look funny!\"\r\n\r\n\"I look funny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh huh!\" she exclaims with a wide smile. \r\n\r\n**• a.)

For example, the scene that you presented...\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe sweltering sun settled high over the plastic-laden playground and the surrounding trees causing brilliant beams light to cascade through the canopies. As a result, shadows stretched like reaching fingers across nearby side-walks, which intertwined like a silken web through the park. Already, children were playing; screaming, chasing one another and laughing contently, creating a powerful energy that filled the hearts of those passing by. Among them was a ruggedly handsome young man of medium build with weary grey eyes that told of a past weight that he still lugged around on his shoulders. Regardless of this pain however, he was present here and now with a warm, pleasant smile stretching his lips thin and a hand brushing across his thin, black locks. His clothes were partially disheveled and carried stains of the day before which were contrasted by a much larger, but younger man who had the bone structure of a Greek god. His clothing was neat and well-kept, each detail of the outfit picked specifically and coordinated right up to his thick, chiseled jaw, bright blue eyes and his blonde hair. He too wore a smile, but it was much lighter than his dark-haired pal beside him. \r\n```\r\nAt that point, I imagine the mood of the characters, their life---things like that and then I try to imagine how the two character's I've made could connect or disconnect depending on the relationship you want to make. I love movies too that certainly helps a lot! ^_^\r\n\r\nAnonynn.  ",

For example, the scene that you presented...</p>\n<pre><code>The sweltering sun settled high over the plastic-laden playground and the surrounding trees causing brilliant beams light to cascade through the canopies. As a result, shadows stretched like reaching fingers across nearby side-walks, which intertwined like a silken web through the park. Already, children were playing; screaming, chasing one another and laughing contently, creating a powerful energy that filled the hearts of those passing by. Among them was a ruggedly handsome young man of medium build with weary grey eyes that told of a past weight that he still lugged around on his shoulders. Regardless of this pain however, he was present here and now with a warm, pleasant smile stretching his lips thin and a hand brushing across his thin, black locks. His clothes were partially disheveled and carried stains of the day before which were contrasted by a much larger, but younger man who had the bone structure of a Greek god. His clothing was neat and well-kept, each detail of the outfit picked specifically and coordinated right up to his thick, chiseled jaw, bright blue eyes and his blonde hair. He too wore a smile, but it was much lighter than his dark-haired pal beside him. \n</code></pre>\n<p>At that point, I imagine the mood of the characters, their life---things like that and then I try to imagine how the two character's I've made could connect or disconnect depending on the relationship you want to make. I love movies too that certainly helps a lot! ^_^</p>\n<p>Anonynn.</p>\n\n",
