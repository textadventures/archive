      "EditableText": "The last game by Gamer (great name for a game writer by the way) unimpressed me so much I just had to try another. Has he improved since the masterpiece of game writing that was â€œThe Tavernâ€? Has he managed to write a game that could accurately be described as â€œnot that crapâ€? Has he â€“ heaven forbid! â€“ written a proper item description? Welllllllllllllllâ€¦.\n\nThe premise of this game is every bit as gripping as the premise of â€œThe Tavernâ€: it seems an evul man has taken over a house and is planning to end the world. You can tell heâ€™s a nasty piece of work by his refusal to conform to normal spelling conventions and be merely evil. A bad guy who thinks heâ€™s evul is really someone to watch out for.\n\nSoâ€¦ into the house you go to confront the evul man. At one point you're told to press a key or â€œpeople will dyeâ€. I hesitated at first, wondering how many people would â€œdyeâ€ if I didnâ€™t press a key. None as it happened. A full five minutes went by without anybody â€œdyeingâ€. Reassured by this, I pressed a key, breathed a sigh of relief when no one â€œdyedâ€, and proceeded to play the game in earnest.\n\nOne room has a clock in it which I am informed is odd. Actually I'm informed itâ€™s odd twice, which goes to show just how odd it really is. This odd clock is, indeed, odd. Despite being of clock size, itâ€™s impossible to take but when the minute hand is examined, you can be shot 1000000 times by a gun. (Which probably explains your inability to take it. 1000000 bullets must weigh a tonne.) Pretty good gun, I have to admit. Even though it shot me, I'm singularly impressed that any manufacturer of weapons can load it with 1000000 bullets. Even more so, I'm impressed that the gun goes ahead and shoots me 1000000 times, despite the fact that the first few shots surely killed me. Still, itâ€™s good of the game to count that I'm shot exactly 1000000 times. Being shot 999999 times just wouldnâ€™t be the same.\n\nHowever, and here's where the game really starts to shine, if you examine the hour hand of the clock, a frying pan falls out of the ceiling. Haha! This seems to be one of those houses where frying pans aren't stored in the kitchen but in the ceiling which are accessed via manipulating the hands on clocks loaded with 1000000 bullets. Makes sense. Makes perfect sense. Pity itâ€™s an invisible frying pan, though, as even though it falls from the ceiling upon examining the hour hand, it never shows up in the game. Bummer. \n\nAs a puzzle, this one is top notch. Itâ€™s impossible to figure out beforehand, will kill you if you select the wrong option, which, of course, you canâ€™t possibly reason out, and if you get it right, you're rewarded with absolutely sod all. They sure donâ€™t make puzzles like this anymore.\n\nRemember the comment I made before about item descriptions? Curious to see whether theyâ€™ve improved? No? Well, me neither actually but Iâ€™ll tell you about them anyway. The fridge is described as â€œitâ€™s a fridgeâ€. The stove, on the other hand, the author has spent considerably longer on and has fleshed out the description to â€œitâ€™s a dirty stove!â€ I have admiration for this lengthier and far more insightful description. Adding the word â€˜dirtyâ€™ allows me to more accurately picture the stove in my mind, and the exclamation mark on the end just hammers home what a dirty stove it really is. Then again, this is the stove of an evul man, so it makes sense that heâ€™s too busy trying to make people â€œdyeâ€ to worry about keeping his stove clean. \n\nUnfortunately, I didnâ€™t manage to encounter the evul man and save people from a fate worse than â€œdyethâ€. He is, I am informed, behind a locked door, but by the time I reached this stage of the game, my sanity was dangerously close to breaking (this was the second game by the same author I had played in the space of 24 hours), and it was a case of either quit playing right then or suffer some kind of hideous seizure. I might evenâ€¦ gulpâ€¦ have â€œdyedâ€.\n\nOverall, I'm tempted to say itâ€™s not as bad as â€œThe Tavernâ€, but thatâ€™s a bit like saying that a mass murderer with 927 deaths to his name isn't quite as bad as a mass murderer with 928 deaths to his name. On a technical scale of competent game writing, with 1 being an absolute stinker and 10 being the kind of game thatâ€™s so amazing you'd cry if you ever managed to get hold of it, this would rank aboutâ€¦ minus 5. Maybe minus 6. But definitely not a minus 7.\n\nIn terms of sheer crapness, itâ€™s another 5 out of 5 corker.",
