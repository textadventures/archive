Or `JS.eval(\"AddTextAndScroll = function(text) {addText(text); scrollToEnd();};\")` to restore the default automatic scrolling.\r\n\r\nIf you have parts where scrolling is enabled or disabled, remember that this won't be restored when a saved game is loaded. You would need to check in the UI Initialisation script whether autoscrolling should be turned on at the moment, and disable it otherwise.",
