LOL\r\n\r\nHi, I'm brand new to Quest but I'm familiar with programming. I've been struggling with this scenario: I wrote a bunch of code, but now I want to surround it with an \"if\" statement. I can't seem to click+drag or copy+paste my code inside the \"if\" statement. Is there really no way to do this other than recreating all the code again, but inside the \"if\" this time?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, sorry if this is a repeat question (I can't find it anywhere).",
