      "EditableText": "Actually this next bit does require code.\n\nLet us add some flavour to the forest; random things seen in the background. As the player wanders through the forest, he might see a rabbit watching him, or butterflies flitting about. We already have a system that groups all the forest locations, so we can start with that (it is less work to have the same random options for any forest location rather than setting them up for each location individually). All we need to do, then, is have a script run when the player enters a room that displays the randomly text.\n\nExcept the player is sure to type X RABBIT. We also need to implement every one of those random items. Or do we? How about just implementing one, and disguising it as a rabbit or two butterflies as we need it?\n\nFirst create an object called &quot;flavour_object&quot;, and tick the scenery box. No need to do anything else with it.\n\nIn each of your container rooms (like [i:1mezc5vs]e_forest[/i:1mezc5vs] in the previous post) you need to set up three string list attributes, called &quot;flavour&quot;, &quot;flavournames&quot; and &quot;flavourdescs&quot;. You then need to add some values.\n\nIn the first, &quot;flavour&quot;, type in the texts the player will see when entering that location, for example:\n[code:1mezc5vs]A rabbit watches you&#46;\nA gust of wind rustles the leaves&#46;\nButterflies chase each other over the flowers&#46;[/code:1mezc5vs]\nIn the second, &quot;flavournames&quot;, type in the names of the objects. This is what the player might type to look at the thing mentioned in the text.\n[code:1mezc5vs]rabbit\n\nbutterfly|butterflies[/code:1mezc5vs]\nNote that I left the second blank, because there was no object. The system will handle that fine, but you must leave a blank one to keep the rest in the right place. You can put in multiple names separated by a vertical bar, as with the last.\n\nIn the third, &quot;flavourdescs&quot;, type in the description the player will see if she looks at the object. Again, the blank one is important.\n[code:1mezc5vs]It is a large brown bunny with big floppy ears&#46;\n\nThe butterflies are bright blue&#46;[/code:1mezc5vs]\nThen the coding. On the [i:1mezc5vs]game[/i:1mezc5vs] object you will see on the Script tab a section called &quot;Script when entering a room&quot;. [url=http&#58;//forum&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/viewtopic&#46;php?f=18&amp;t=4771:1mezc5vs]Paste the code below in there[/url:1mezc5vs]:\n\n[code:1mezc5vs]flavour_object&#46;parent = game\nif (HasAttribute(game&#46;pov&#46;parent, &quot;parent&quot;)) {\n  if (HasAttribute(game&#46;pov&#46;parent&#46;parent, &quot;flavour&quot;)) {\n    n = GetRandomInt(0, 20)\n    if (n &lt; ListCount(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavour)) {\n      msg (StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavour, n))\n      if (HasAttribute(player&#46;parent&#46;parent, &quot;flavournames&quot;) and HasAttribute(player&#46;parent&#46;parent, &quot;flavourdescs&quot;)) {\n        if (n &lt; ListCount(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames) and n &lt; ListCount(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames)) {\n          if (not StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames, n) = &quot;&quot; and not StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames, n) = &quot;&quot;) {\n            flavour_object&#46;parent = player&#46;parent\n            flavour_object&#46;alt = Split(StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames, n), &quot;|&quot;)\n            flavour_object&#46;look = StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavourdescs, n)\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}[/code:1mezc5vs]\n\nThe code will run each time the player enters a room. First it moves the flavour_object object away to reset itself, then it checks a load of things before proceeding (that this room has a containing room, that the containing room has the needed string lists).\n\nIt then generates a random number, from 0 to 20 (you may want to adjust that; I use 5 in the example game below). If the random number is less than the number of texts, then it prints the text.\n\nNext it checks if there are enties in the flavournames and flavourdescs lists. If there are, then it moves the flavour_object object, and then disguises it as the object mentioned, by setting its &quot;alt&quot; and &quot;look&quot; attributes (the &quot;alt&quot; attribute is an array of alternative names, so is more convenient than setting the &quot;alias&quot; attribute - and you cannot chane the &quot;name&quot; attribute during the game).\n\n\nExample game:\n\n[code:1mezc5vs]&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;6&#46;5510&#46;29036--&gt;\n&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

Again, the blank one is important.<br/><pre><code>It is a large brown bunny with big floppy ears&#46;<br/><br/>The butterflies are bright blue&#46;</code></pre><br/>Then the coding. On the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">game</span> object you will see on the Script tab a section called &quot;Script when entering a room&quot;. <a href=\"http&#58;//forum&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/viewtopic&#46;php?f=18&amp;t=4771\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paste the code below in there</a>:<br/><br/><pre><code>flavour_object&#46;parent = game<br/>if (HasAttribute(game&#46;pov&#46;parent, &quot;parent&quot;)) {<br/>  if (HasAttribute(game&#46;pov&#46;parent&#46;parent, &quot;flavour&quot;)) {<br/>    n = GetRandomInt(0, 20)<br/>    if (n &lt; ListCount(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavour)) {<br/>      msg (StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavour, n))<br/>      if (HasAttribute(player&#46;parent&#46;parent, &quot;flavournames&quot;) and HasAttribute(player&#46;parent&#46;parent, &quot;flavourdescs&quot;)) {<br/>        if (n &lt; ListCount(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames) and n &lt; ListCount(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames)) {<br/>          if (not StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames, n) = &quot;&quot; and not StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames, n) = &quot;&quot;) {<br/>            flavour_object&#46;parent = player&#46;parent<br/>            flavour_object&#46;alt = Split(StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavournames, n), &quot;|&quot;)<br/>            flavour_object&#46;look = StringListItem(player&#46;parent&#46;parent&#46;flavourdescs, n)<br/>          }<br/>        }<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</code></pre><br/><br/>The code will run each time the player enters a room. First it moves the flavour_object object away to reset itself, then it checks a load of things before proceeding (that this room has a containing room, that the containing room has the needed string lists).<br/><br/>It then generates a random number, from 0 to 20 (you may want to adjust that; I use 5 in the example game below). If the random number is less than the number of texts, then it prints the text.<br/><br/>Next it checks if there are enties in the flavournames and flavourdescs lists. If there are, then it moves the flavour_object object, and then disguises it as the object mentioned, by setting its &quot;alt&quot; and &quot;look&quot; attributes (the &quot;alt&quot; attribute is an array of alternative names, so is more convenient than setting the &quot;alias&quot; attribute - and you cannot chane the &quot;name&quot; attribute during the game).<br/><br/><br/>Example game:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;6&#46;5510&#46;29036--&gt;<br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;
