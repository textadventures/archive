May end up in ANY room in the house.  In this case, a totally random room.\n\nHow about have the player end up in a random room from a predefined set of rooms.  Example:  The overdrinker, slightly tipsy, may stagger into the wrong bedroom.  In this case, a random event with only two or three outcomes.\n\nI've seen some posts regarding random events, but I want to move my user to a random room.\n\nThanks in advance!",
