I have an icon tray telling me the program is running at the same time though. I have tried reinstalling the program multiple times. I have had this problem for a while and have been looking for an answer using google to see if anyone else has this problem yet I turn up very little. If someone could help provide a fix that would be great. Also if I click on the tray to go to the window it does that somehow even though there is no window on screen and when I click it again it shows a box coming in from off-screen to the left like the program is over there. Yet windows doesn't allow for anything to go that far over.",

Might still be worth trying just in case)",
