I decided to try this tonight, to see if I could do it without help. I went through the process of setting up scripts that would allow me to use either the newspaper from the lounge or a roll of paper towels in the kitchen to swat the bee. It works, but after I use either object on the bee, I still get the message \"The bee buzzes past you. Pesky bee,\" which is the message that's supposed to print every twenty seconds when the timer is activated. It only prints the message once after the bee is swatted, but I wasn't expecting it to print it again at all.\r\n\r\nBelow is my code from the two objects I used on the bee, as well as my code from the bee. Is there something wrong somewhere that is making this happen?\r\n\r\nif (GetBoolean(bee, \"Dead\")) {\r\n  DisableTimer (Bee Timer)\r\n  RemoveObject (bee)\r\n  msg (\"To your relief, the annoying bee is now no more.\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"A tiny yellow and black bumblebee.\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nmsg (\"You swat the bee with the newspaper.\")\r\nSetObjectFlagOn (bee, \"Dead\")\r\n\r\nmsg (\"You swat the bee with the roll of paper towels.\")\r\nSetObjectFlagOn (bee, \"Dead\")\r\n",
