The more I think about it, the less I think that it would be worth it to build it in.  The use of demonstrative pronouns are highly dependent on pragmatics which is one of the harder things to get computers handle correctly.  Unless it comes up a lot, I think that each programer would be best off handling each situation as a special case because they will know and undersand the pragmatic situation that the dialog is taking place in.<br/><br/>Even if you don't know the jargon &quot;pragmatics&quot; you use pragmatics everyday and as a human are very very good at it.",
