Many thanks to everybody who got in touch to volunteer to help. I was really pleased that so many people want to see these projects continue into the future. I am now happy to announce that we have a new team in place!\r\n\r\n**Luis Felipe Morales** will be taking over the **textadventures.co.uk** and **ActiveLit** websites, and also **Squiffy**. A programmer since the 1980s, Luis has been involved with the Spanish interactive fiction community since he was young. He has maintained and created several internet portals and now works as a freelancer.\r\n\r\n**Jay Nabonne** and **Andy a.k.a The Pixie** will be taking over development of **Quest**. Both have been very active members of the forums for a long time. Jay is a lifelong programmer and game player who is interested in not only creating games but helping others to do the same. A California native, he now lives with his wife in the UK. Andy has been playing and creating text adventure games since the Eighties, has been using Quest for over five years and has written various guides and libraries for the system.\r\n\r\n**Greg Fenton** and **Nathan Clive Gerard** will each be **running servers** for Quest's WebPlayer and WebEditor. Greg is a developer who wrote his first text adventure in dBase III on an IBM PC back in the very late 1980s shortly after leaving high school. Nathan is a regular player of text adventures from the UK (currently living in the USA), who spends his days setting up and looking after web servers in the cloud.\r\n\r\nI'll be working with each of them over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition. Please welcome them aboard!",
