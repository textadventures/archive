      "EditableText": "Hey all,\r\nSuper new to all this, maybe 3 weeks in, but very much enjoying learning to use the toolset. Like a lot of  us I assume, I grew up playing the  Lone Wolf Gamebooks and would like to recreate that experience inasmuch as possible. I was wondering first and foremost if it was possible to set up a situation where the reader can set their own attributes at the outset of an adventure from a pool of given points? I believe I've figured out how to set attributes in general using the documentation, although I'm sure there's likely a more elegant way to do it (and keeping in mind that I have very minimal exposure to javascript prior to this, so I'm mostly learning as I go). It looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhat's Your Strength? [[1]](start, strength=1) or [[2]](start, strength=2) or [[3]](start, strength=3)?\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` \r\n[[start]]:\r\nYour Strength Score has been recorded.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gets the job done, I suppose (although I'm not sure where this is saved or how to reference it later for attribute checks, there must be a way, or else why include it? I probably just haven't stumbled upon the answer yet), but I'm not sure how to limit the player to a specific pool of points that they can use to create a balanced character and not break the game by creating a super soldier. I've looked through the forums but much of what I've found about attributes is related to Quest, not squiffy, and unless I missed it, which is totally a possibility,  the documentation doesn't really get this specific either. I'm also assuming that whatever the answer to this is will also work for creating an initial inventory out of a given set of items. \r\n\r\nAny advice you  guys might have to set  me in the right direction would be so appreciated,  thank you in advance. Looking forward to getting to know ya'll and play your games!",

When you compile, if there isn't a <code>@start</code> line, one will be added in the background with the name of the first section in the file.</p>\n<p>You mentioned adding a passage to every section. In my sidebar code, it also modifies some things so that a passage link anywhere can point to a passage in the master section (so the master section can contain stuff like <code>[drink potion]</code> links you might put in the sidebar)</p>\n<p>For your alert example, you could do something like:</p>\n<pre><code>    alert(\"Hello, \" + squiffy.get(\"CaptFirst\"));\n</code></pre>\n<p>although this might be a bad idea because <code>alert</code> is deprecared and some browsers have been saying support for it will be dropped because it's so often abused (not sure if it actually happened yet)</p>\n\n",
