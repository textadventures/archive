Can you tell me more about this and does 5 have these features?

( automatic combat without the player having to type something and hit return until either the NPC or player is dead)\n\n6) Can the Quest online player versions be used to accept multiple users playing the same game like in a Mud? \n  a) If so, what about interactivity between multiple players?\n\n7) Ability for an online player to make changes in the game that permanently changes the game world such as creating their own objects, houses, etc. ( a long shot I know for IF, but I thought I'd ask.)\n\nSorry for so many questions. I'm asking these things because I see the popularity of small MMO's and even Muds growing. Sadly however, unless you want to learn a heavy programing language, or scripting language usually based on a heavy programming language, a Windows user cannot make a good interactive multi-player online text based game. I believe if there were an IF creation application that could do all the things people would want in a multi-player online text based game, and without all the hassles of learning C or having to rely on Unix servers etc, ( Windows users could host either from Home or with dedicated hosts using windows servers) it would allow more games to get out and bring more people to Interactive Fiction &lt;-- which is the main goal here. It wouldn't have to be exactly like a Mud, but close enough to have the major functions people look for in a Mud like game. Is it possible to pull this off with Quest?\n\nThank you.",

      "EditableText": "There are windows-based multiplayer text adventure type programs that have been written before but they largely sucked and I don't think are being actively developed. I think one of the biggest issues with this is because a lot of people lose interest in something that's purely text-based. It's unfortunate, but it's a very prevalent attitude.\n\nI think you might have an easier time finding what you're looking for if you didn't restrict yourself to programs that are windows based. Most MUDS are *nix based and reside on a server somewhere, and that's probably the approach you should be looking at if you want to develop a serious MUD. That's exactly how Iron Realms operates all of their different MUD worlds, and they're making decent money at it too.\n\nThat being said, if you can't find something that does what you want and how you want, there's always the option of making it yourself or paying someone to make it for you, if you lack the abilities to do it yourself.",
