From what I have read on the IF sites, plus my own experience, the most widely used command in IF is &quot;x&quot;,which doesn't exist in your game, either literally as an input command or even in function.</p></blockquote><br/>The 'x' command is there, it just doesn't matter if you type 'x', 'use', or whatever else makes sense for that item. The items that react when referred to in a solo fashion will do things, including showing more detail if necessary, just like the traditional examine. If you found the Grate or the Well in the garden, try typing 'x' on those to see what I mean. <br/><br/><blockquote><p>1) As you have pared things down so much, even to the point of eliminating verbs as a fundamental input necessity, where the player is effectively entering words they see on screen (hint hint!), you could probably dispense with the parser altogether. That might be against your design goals, but I'm throwing it out there as an option you might not have considered, as it would help players have a different set of expectations up front.</p></blockquote><br/>This is an interesting idea, but it's not possible if you want to still let players type sentences. You also need fundamental verbs like &quot;take&quot;.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>2) I've thought about this a bit over night, and I've come to realize that the deal breaker for me is the lack of the ability to explore textually the game environment. That gets back to our friend &quot;x&quot; (or &quot;examine&quot; or &quot;look at&quot; or whatever). A major draw for me with IF is being able to dive into the environment, to eke out details by looking at things and finding new things to look at. I love having nice rich descriptions that put me in the game. I must confess that I'm not a big puzzle fan. I'm not that keen on the whole &quot;magpie collecting items to use in arcane ways elsewhere&quot; thing. I'll do it, and I know it's key to this sort of IF, but if a game is reduced down to being *solely* that, with no roses to smell along the way, then it's lost its appeal for me. I'm basically walking around looking for things to pick up. Since you have said others have enjoyed it, I'll leave it at that. I'm clearly not your target audience. But I wanted to offer that last bit of feedback, in case it's useful to you.</p></blockquote><br/>Understood. You're right, the engine has been designed to place heavy emphasis on item combinations and/or usage at certain locations to solve puzzles, while verbs have been abstracted out as much as possible.<br/><br/>The puzzles are also designed to avoid being overtly complicated, illogical, or obscure. It's also impossible to save yourself into a &quot;no-win&quot; situation.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I am also most impressed that you wrote this in C++, rolling your own system instead of using someone else's! That is no small feat, and you've done a great job. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --></p></blockquote><br/>Thanks - It turned out better than I expected. I also anticipated releasing a lot of games with it, so the engine has been designed to perform a lot of the heavy-lifting for you.<br/><br/>I've actually finished planning the third game (a &quot;haunted house&quot; of sorts), but I'll take a bit of a break before implementing it. <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) -->",
