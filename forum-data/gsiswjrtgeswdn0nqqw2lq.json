I’m starting anew game; trying to once again get a little bit more out of my comfort zone while getting a better grasp of Quest’s functions.\r\nThis time I’m in a bit of a pickle though.... (@_@)\r\nI wanted to make a game a bit like you’re on an iPhone- you have selections to choose from, and the contact on the other end (an NPC) will respond accordingly. I’ve got the message- and- response thing all sorted out in a little pseudocode I’ve made, but before I start, does anyone’s know how to format Quest so the UI looks like iMessages or something similar??? (Like little speech bubbles)\r\nI’m pretty sure with photo editing software I can make this, but I really would love it if there was a simpler way to just format it so all I would have to do is insert the text. ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ\r\n\r\nThat would be a big help！(๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)",

I haven't used the Gamebook side of Quest desktop, but I've built a new UI for my game using the Text Adventure and exporting with questJS. Here is a quick example of what I have done for my UI, it is a bit behind the current releases, but the next update will include current releases. It is all handled with CSS and questJS exporting. If you aren't going to export with questJS, all of the UI changes have to happen inside Quest, under the User Interface Init (desktop Quest has this under the Advanced Scripts tab, which means you have to enable it under the Features tab first).\r\n\r\nBe well,\r\nRaist\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.uoexpanse.com/quests/images/TETMC11beta.png\" />",
