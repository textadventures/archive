      "EditableText": "Ok, I'm in the middle of working on a game, I've always been an artist, and I have a good variable game scripted, so I thought I could try this as a way to build the game, as it is almost like a merge between visual novel/text adventure and point and click. I know it's hard to explain. I have the sprites and backgrounds all ready for the first initial scene of the game, but before I continue I need some help. When I say it is a merge of those three is that my intention is to make the game in portrait mode, with the top half of the screen being my art work, relying on responses from the bottom half of the screen, my intention is to port it to smartphones, but working in that format on the computer is a starting point just now. What I mean is, almost similar to point and click but you can't walk around unless that is a point of interest, so in the bottom half I would have a set of interactions that would have to be pressed before the object/character on the image for a relevant response. I haven't coded in so long and I'm wondering if this is possible with quest to have an interface that the commands are linked to, I have plenty of time on my hands but if anyone can suggest a toolkit that may suit my needs better I would be grateful, I'm finding it hard to find a middle ground for my project, Adventure Creator assets on Unity aren't exactly what I am going for, I have a good idea of what I'm trying to achieve, even though I'm open to suggestions, I feel like as this is mostly a novel with variable outcomes rather than a puzzle based point and click that I would rather have the text based story on the forefront whilst having a visual representation of what I'm trying to convey go on in the top half. If anyone could help or knows what I'm trying to achieve thanks",
