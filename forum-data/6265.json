      "EditableText": "My world template has day/night cycles based on a timer.  Upon crossing over from night into day or vice versa, the room description is repeated, and if it's night time, you get the added message that it's dark and that you might not be able to see as well.\n\nThere is also a property I've added to my world template space object type (wt_spc) to indicate whether a given room is inside or outside.\nThe room's environment (an attribute in wt_spc pointing to an environment room) can do many things, but right now, whether inside or outside, you get the message that it's now morning or evening.\n\nIf you're inside a deep dark castle, you're not really going to know suddenly when it's 6am and it's light outside. Currently, no test is performed whether the player is inside or outside when informed of the day/night crossover.\n\nQuestion: As a player, would you rather NOT be informed that it's now day or night when inside, and only have it run for outside?  Either way, there's always a 24-hour clock, but players might not make the connection that 03:00 means it's dark outside and can't see squat and where are my exits, etc.\n\nThe complication is having windows in a room. If it's 3:00am, and you have no source of light in a room, the room is dark. If there is a window letting in outside light, I want the room to gain at least a little bit of light (provided there's no curtains, boards, or shutters blocking the window panes).  \nI therefore, upon crossing into night or day, want the room description to update to something like &quot;The room brightens as morning breaks.&quot; or something like that. \n\nIf I merely test if Room = Inside then don't update room description, then I'm not taking windows (or outside light of any kind, like holes in the roof, etc.).\nThoughts?",
