The DNA~genetic difference among humans is neglible: the difference between humans and chimps is but 2% DNA~genetic difference and the difference between humans and a potato plant, yes you heard~read that right lol, is only an 8% DNA~genetic difference !!!

This is now possible by having the more complex organism~character classification system, and many other such coding uses.

This kind of nested hierarchy seen as a product of evolution is also what is seen in the class hierarchy with object-orientated programming (if you have single inheritance anyway), and is pretty straightforward to do with Quest.</blockquote><br/><br/>yes, this works well with quest's own setup (either as Object Types ~ Inherited Attributes or the other types of Attributes: booleans and stringlists), and yes, most people would not do this, using instead the common simplified &quot;just races only&quot; D&amp;D (human, dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, half-orc) and probably just for their playable characters too. It just depends how complex or non-complex you want to do set it up in your game, hehe <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) --><br/><br/>Some people might want the greater complexity though, such as different races of elves: night~dark elves, high elves, wood elves (TES games, WC games)<br/><br/>Or, maybe of humans: bretons, nords, redguards, imperials (TES games)<br/><br/>Or, other &quot;humanoids&quot; (or &quot;hybrids&quot;): khajitt, argonians (TES games), or centaurs, harpies, mermaids, minotaurs, gorgons (Greek Mythology)<br/><br/>for example ,TES has to have coding that separates the human races from the &quot;humanoid&quot; races, since they have walking animations that are different, as well as what armor slots that they can wear. Now, this can easily be done with just a single boolean, but it shows my point, that it could be possible to have, even the extreme classification complexity that I've posted here, to be needed~required in a game. Regardless, it does provide people with ideas, even if it in full is rarely used in games.<br/><br/>so, the deep level of classification can be needed, &quot;upwards in parents&quot; or &quot;downwards in childs&quot;<br/><br/>------------------<br/><br/>Or, did you mean something else, with the coding reference that you mentioned?, as maybe I misunderstood what you were saying, lol. I do often misunderstand people, sighs.",
