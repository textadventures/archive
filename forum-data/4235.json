      "EditableText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just downloaded Quest 5 and started to work with it. So far it's been a very pleasant thing and I can surely tell that I took a liking to it. But as of right now I have encountered some issues which the search option didn't provide me with. (If I have been just unaware of them I apologize in advance.)\n\n1.) Save the game. I'm planning on working something bigger and since I can't really tell how long it's going to be I'm asking myself if there is an actual save-function to let the player save his progress.\n\n2.) Starting screen. While I am not planning on creating a picture I rather want to display some text first, let the player decide to have some features (such as skills for example) and then get going with the whole thing. How do I manage to do that? I've tried to use scripts but they never seemed to work. I chose a &quot;before entering room&quot; and then print message in order to let some Text pop up first. My plan is to actually create some sort of starting dialogue which lets the player chose what kind of character he/she wants to play.\n\n3.) Text before objects. As of right now the game shows interactive objects first and displays the description of the room afterwards. Is there a way to reverse that? I think it's quite confusing to have interactive objects displayed first.\n\nThanks in advance (and sorry if these have been asked before).",

You can start the player off there and have scripts to do what you want without having to worry about the normal room behavior kicking in. Then, when you're done getting the initial player info, you can just move the player to the game's first real room to begin play.\n\n3) As HK said, you can change the order of the automatically generated items in the &quot;Room description layout&quot; section of the Room Descriptions tab of the &quot;game&quot; object.",

Sorry, I couldn't word this very clearly, lol. keep reading below, to hopefully have a more clear reading~understanding of it, lol.\n\n(Variable) = (Value_or_Expression)\n(String) = (Value_or_Expression)\nexample: strength = 100 \n\n(Attribute) = (Value_or_Expression)\n(Object.String) = (depends on the type of attribute that it is: string, integer~int, boolean, list, dictionary, double, etc)\nexample: player.strength = 100\n\n------\n\nQuest's terminology is a bit different from the generic programming terminology:\n\n(quest's &quot;double&quot; is the same as a &quot;float~floating point&quot;, ie a decimal number amount)\n(quest's &quot;dictionaries&quot;, and maybe &quot;lists&quot; too ~ not sure, is the same as &quot;arrays&quot;, I think anyways ~ arrays confused me, lol)\n\nIn quest, the generic programming terminology of &quot;Variable&quot; is split into two sub-categories:\n\n&quot;Variable&quot; and &quot;Attribute&quot;\n\nA &quot;Variable&quot; is local, as it is *NOT* attached to something permanent (an Object, well so long as the Object still exists, anyways, of course, lol)\n\nVariable = Value_or_Expression\nie: handled = false\nie: you_go_first = true\nie: strength = 100\nie: primary_pigment_color_string_list = split (&quot;red;blue;yellow&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)\nie: x = 5\nie: x = 4 * (5 + y)\n\nAn &quot;Attribute&quot;

from the &quot;Attribute&quot; (Object.Attribute) ??? this is how you &quot;attach&quot; it in scripting\n\nor in the GUI~Editor:\n\nyou would &quot;add&quot; an Attribute to an Object to do the 'attachment'\n\nie: &quot;HK&quot; Object -&gt; Attributes (Tab) -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (set it up)\n\n-----\n\nwhen you have an &quot;Object.Attribute&quot; defined (ie: HK.strength), you can then &quot;call upon or use&quot; that Attribute in any scripting:\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;HK&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;strength&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;function name=&quot;blah_1_function&quot;&gt;\n-&gt;

you_go_first = false\n-&gt; if (HK.speed &gt; orc.speed) {\n-&gt;-&gt; you_go_first = true\n-&gt; }\n-&gt; if (you_go_first = true) {\n-&gt;-&gt; orc.hp = HK.damage - orc.hp\n-&gt; } else if (you_go_first = false) {\n-&gt;-&gt;

orc.mp = spell.cost - orc.mp\n-&gt; }\n&lt;/function&gt;\n\n// ERROR, as &quot;you_go_first&quot; is never defined, and because it's local (no attachment to an object), it can't be used outside of the &quot;blah_1_function&quot; Function, such as within the &quot;blah_2_function&quot; Function.\n\n-------------\n\nA Library is merely a code file (think of a Library as like being a &quot;patch&quot;, an &quot;expansion_pack&quot;, or even the &quot;game_engine_source_code_itself&quot;), quest itself, is actually made up of libraries:\n\nEnglish.aslx\nCore.aslx (which is merely a database, ie it runs~executes, of all the many individual core files, if I understand it correctly)\n\nand you can add in other libraries too:\n\n[code:f0eux160]&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Pixie's Spell Library File&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Chase's Wearables Library File&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;d67ec73f-f879-4911-9d88-c02ea527c534&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2013&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:f0eux160]\n\nor, heck, create your own quest game engine:\n\n[code:f0eux160]&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;HK's Game Engine Library File&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  // the code design would be totally different, lol\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:f0eux160]\n\n--------------------------\n\n2. it depends on the variable (aka 'attributes'), if it's an attribute specific to an object, then you'd want to define it within that object obviously, but if its a game attribute, than there's a few ways of doing this. but let me explain first what I mean here.\n\n&quot;strength&quot; would be set~defined on every &quot;actor~character~pc~npc&quot; Object, obviously, as it's a (RPG common) in-game stat attribute for those type of objects.\n\nHK.strength = 100\nblackstar.strength = 50 // hehe\norc.strength = 25\netc...\n\nbut say you've got &quot;game progression event flag~boolean&quot; variables~attributes, such as:\n\ndragon_slayer_sword_acquired = false\ndragon_killed = false\nrescued_princess = false\n\n&lt;turnscript name=&quot;global_turn_script&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;enabled /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;script&gt;\n-&gt;-&gt; if (dragon_slayer_sword_acquired = true) {\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; // script that moves or creates the &quot;dragon&quot; Object into the game world\n-&gt;-&gt; }\n-&gt;-&gt; if (dragon_killed = true) {\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; // script that unlocks the door to the &quot;princess&quot; Object\n-&gt;-&gt; }\n-&gt;-&gt; if (rescued_princess = true) {\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;You won the game!&quot;)\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; finish\n-&gt;-&gt; }\n-&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/turnscript&gt;\n\nthese, would be &quot;game event&quot; (&quot;progression&quot;) boolean attributes, which aren't applied to multiple objects as &quot;strength&quot; would be.\n\nso, you can &quot;add&quot; these attributes to the &quot;game&quot; Object:\n\nin the GUI~Editor:\n\n&quot;game&quot; Object -&gt; Attributes (Tab) -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (set them up)\n\nbut, the &quot;game&quot; Object is already crowded enough already...\n\nso, a nifty thing to do, is to create an Object, which isn't within a room type Object:\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;game&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;object name=&quot;room&quot; &gt;\n-&gt; &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;object name=&quot;global_data_object&quot;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;dragon_slayer_sword_acquired&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;dragon_killed&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;princess_rescued&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\nHOWEVER, the only problem with this, is that if you want this stuff to be displayed during game play in the right panel, you must use the &quot;game&quot; Object (or the Player Objects). Though, you can display it by using, a Command, for example to display it within the left text window~pane during game play:\n\n&lt;command name=&quot;quest_command&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;pattern&gt;show quest&lt;/pattern&gt;\n-&gt;

      "HTML": "1. you're correct about the terminology of quest's 'variable' and 'attribute', though do note that to be global, it must be attached to an object (Object.global_variable_aka_quest's_attribute), but otherwise quest's 'variable' and 'attribute' is the same thing: it's merely a string value that equals an Attribute Type's Value. Sorry, I couldn't word this very clearly, lol. keep reading below, to hopefully have a more clear reading~understanding of it, lol.<br/><br/>(Variable) = (Value_or_Expression)<br/>(String) = (Value_or_Expression)<br/>example: strength = 100 <br/><br/>(Attribute) = (Value_or_Expression)<br/>(Object.String) = (depends on the type of attribute that it is: string, integer~int, boolean, list, dictionary, double, etc)<br/>example: player.strength = 100<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Quest's terminology is a bit different from the generic programming terminology:<br/><br/>(quest's &quot;double&quot; is the same as a &quot;float~floating point&quot;, ie a decimal number amount)<br/>(quest's &quot;dictionaries&quot;, and maybe &quot;lists&quot; too ~ not sure, is the same as &quot;arrays&quot;, I think anyways ~ arrays confused me, lol)<br/><br/>In quest, the generic programming terminology of &quot;Variable&quot; is split into two sub-categories:<br/><br/>&quot;Variable&quot; and &quot;Attribute&quot;<br/><br/>A &quot;Variable&quot; is local, as it is *NOT* attached to something permanent (an Object, well so long as the Object still exists, anyways, of course, lol)<br/><br/>Variable = Value_or_Expression<br/>ie: handled = false<br/>ie: you_go_first = true<br/>ie: strength = 100<br/>ie: primary_pigment_color_string_list = split (&quot;red;blue;yellow&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)<br/>ie: x = 5<br/>ie: x = 4 * (5 + y)<br/><br/>An &quot;Attribute&quot; is global, as it *IS* 'attached' (has the dot~period between the &quot;Object&quot; and the &quot;Attribute&quot;) to something permanent (an Object, well... so long as the Object still exists, anyways, of course, lol)<br/><br/>Object.Attribute_or_Variable_whatever_you_want_to_call_this_String_Value_lol = Value_or_Expression<br/>ie: room.radiation = 30<br/>ie: table.material = &quot;wood&quot;<br/>ie: game.x = 5<br/>ie: game.turns = 0<br/>ie: player.turns = 0<br/>ie: player.strength = 20<br/>ie: HK.strength = 100<br/>ie: HK.favorite_color = black<br/>ie: HK.favorite_color_string_list = split (&quot;black;red&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)<br/>ie: HK.dead = false<br/>ie: orc.fight =&gt;

from the &quot;Attribute&quot; (Object.Attribute) ??? this is how you &quot;attach&quot; it in scripting<br/><br/>or in the GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>you would &quot;add&quot; an Attribute to an Object to do the 'attachment'<br/><br/>ie: &quot;HK&quot; Object -&gt; Attributes (Tab) -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (set it up)<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>when you have an &quot;Object.Attribute&quot; defined (ie: HK.strength), you can then &quot;call upon or use&quot; that Attribute in any scripting:<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;HK&quot;&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;strength&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;function name=&quot;blah_1_function&quot;&gt;<br/>-&gt;

Function, such as within the &quot;blah_2_function&quot; Function.<br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>A Library is merely a code file (think of a Library as like being a &quot;patch&quot;, an &quot;expansion_pack&quot;, or even the &quot;game_engine_source_code_itself&quot;), quest itself, is actually made up of libraries:<br/><br/>English.aslx<br/>Core.aslx (which is merely a database, ie it runs~executes, of all the many individual core files, if I understand it correctly)<br/><br/>and you can add in other libraries too:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Pixie's Spell Library File&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Chase's Wearables Library File&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;d67ec73f-f879-4911-9d88-c02ea527c534&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2013&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot;

would be set~defined on every &quot;actor~character~pc~npc&quot; Object, obviously, as it's a (RPG common) in-game stat attribute for those type of objects.<br/><br/>HK.strength = 100<br/>blackstar.strength = 50 // hehe<br/>orc.strength = 25<br/>etc...<br/><br/>but say you've got &quot;game progression event flag~boolean&quot; variables~attributes, such as:<br/><br/>dragon_slayer_sword_acquired = false<br/>dragon_killed = false<br/>rescued_princess = false<br/><br/>&lt;turnscript name=&quot;global_turn_script&quot;&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;enabled /&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;script&gt;<br/>-&gt;-&gt; if (dragon_slayer_sword_acquired = true) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; // script that moves or creates the &quot;dragon&quot; Object into the game world<br/>-&gt;-&gt; }<br/>-&gt;-&gt; if (dragon_killed = true) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; // script that unlocks the door to the &quot;princess&quot; Object<br/>-&gt;-&gt; }<br/>-&gt;-&gt; if (rescued_princess = true) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;You won the game!&quot;)<br/>-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; finish<br/>-&gt;-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; &lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;/turnscript&gt;<br/><br/>these, would be &quot;game event&quot; (&quot;progression&quot;) boolean attributes, which aren't applied to multiple objects as &quot;strength&quot; would be.<br/><br/>so, you can &quot;add&quot; these attributes to the &quot;game&quot; Object:<br/><br/>in the GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>&quot;game&quot; Object -&gt; Attributes (Tab) -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (set them up)<br/><br/>but, the &quot;game&quot; Object is already crowded enough already...<br/><br/>so, a nifty thing to do, is to create an Object, which isn't within a room type Object:<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;game&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;room&quot; &gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;global_data_object&quot;<br/>-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;dragon_slayer_sword_acquired&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;dragon_killed&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;princess_rescued&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>HOWEVER, the only problem with this, is that if you want this stuff to be displayed during game play in the right panel, you must use the &quot;game&quot; Object (or the Player Objects). Though, you can display it by using, a Command, for example to display it within the left text window~pane during game play:<br/><br/>&lt;command name=&quot;quest_command&quot;&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;pattern&gt;show quest&lt;/pattern&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;script&gt;<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;Dragon Slayer Sword Acquired?: &quot; + global_data_object.dragon_slayer_sword_acquired)<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;Dragon Killed?: &quot; + global_data_object.dragon_killed)<br/>-&gt;-&gt;

I have to attach the attributes towards the &quot;player object&quot; in order to permanently provide it with all the necessary information.\n\nAfter thinking about a few things I've decided to go with Jays Idea since the menu may be fine but it also disrupts the flow of the game. (meaning a pop-up menu feels awkward given the overall style of the game. So instead I go with a room where I'm capable of not only giving the player a choice to make but also to inform him / her about his choice to make.\nBasically my thought was this:\n\nA menu only provides with to choices\n&quot;Policeman&quot;\n&quot;Detective&quot;\n\nAnd no further explanation whatsoever without making it look even more awkward. So I can just create another room and define what the player sees with also giving him som information about whats going to happen. E.g.:\n\n&quot;Policeman - physically adept and trained with a gun&quot;\n&quot;Detective - Trained with a gun and quite adept at solving puzzles&quot;\n\nYet I am a bit puzzled on how to archieve that. (Thanks for being so patient with me, folks) I tried several different scripts but none of them seem to work properly.\nThis would mean that I create the custom verb &quot;chose&quot; in order to either chose the &quot;male&quot; object or the &quot;female&quot; object.\nNow I am relying upon an If-function so it goes basically like this:\n\nIf player &quot;chose&quot; &quot;male&quot; then attach &quot;male&quot;-attribute to player object. (or set male to 1) Else do nothing.\nIf player &quot;chose&quot; female&quot; then attach &quot;female&quot;-attribute to player object. (or set female to 1) Else do nothing.\n\nSo I've set up a global_data_object just as HK mentioned and added two attributes to it:\n&quot;playermale&quot;\n&quot;playerfemale&quot;\n\nboth bolean with &quot;false&quot; as value.\n\nSo this means I have to change the script towards this:\n\nIf player &quot;chose&quot; &quot;male&quot; then change &quot;playermale&quot;-attribute to &quot;true&quot;. Else do nothing.\nIf player &quot;chose&quot; female&quot; then change &quot;playerfemale&quot;-attribute to &quot;true&quot;. Else do nothing.\n\nAnd since this made some problems I removed the global_data_object and attached &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; onto the &quot;player&quot;-object to simplify it's use. Both are initially set onto &quot;false&quot; in order to give the player the choice and lead him further once one of them is set to &quot;true&quot;. I've tried to simplify it in order to wait for specific input.\n\nSo my problem now is that the game needs to recognize that when the player enters &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; his character becomes so and therefore change the attached player-attribute &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; to true.",

(meaning a pop-up menu feels awkward given the overall style of the game.[/quote:oyfsbmks]\n\nthere's only two methods that I know of for getting a game user's input during game play:\n\n1. forced~locked selection of choices by the game user:\n\nA. &quot;show menu&quot;\nB. Verb Buttons and~or Hyperlink commands in the text\nC. Commands\n\n2. open typed-in input by the game user:\n\nA. &quot;get input&quot;\nB. Commands\n\n[quote=&quot;blackstar&quot;:oyfsbmks]So instead I go with a room where I'm capable of not only giving the player a choice to make but also to inform him / her about his choice to make.\nBasically my thought was this:\n\nA menu only provides with to choices\n&quot;Policeman&quot;\n&quot;Detective&quot;\n\nAnd no further explanation whatsoever without making it look even more awkward. So I can just create another room and define what the player sees with also giving him som information about whats going to happen. E.g.:\n\n&quot;Policeman - physically adept and trained with a gun&quot;\n&quot;Detective - Trained with a gun and quite adept at solving puzzles&quot;\n\nYet I am a bit puzzled on how to archieve that.

Lastly, you can have them &quot;enabled&quot; at the start of the game, or you can choose (aka script) when to &quot;enable&quot; them as well.\n\nso for example, creating game (or 'player', or 'non-player non-game Object') turns (and multiple ways of displaying of them):\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;game&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; // blah scripts\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;turns&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;statusattributes&quot; type=&quot;simplestringdictionary&quot;&gt;turns = Turns: !&lt;/attr&gt;\n-&gt; // blah scripts\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;turns&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;statusattributes&quot; type=&quot;simplestringdictionary&quot;&gt;turns = Turns: !&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;HK&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;turns&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;statusattributes&quot; type=&quot;simplestringdictionary&quot;&gt;turns = Turns: !&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;turns_clock&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;turns&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;turnscript name=&quot;global_turn_script&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;enabled /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;script&gt;\n-&gt;-&gt; show_turns_function\n-&gt;-&gt; game.turns = game.turns + 1\n-&gt;-&gt; player.turns = player.turns + 1\n-&gt;-&gt; HK.turns = HK.turns + 1\n-&gt;-&gt; turns_clock.turns = turns_clock.turns + 1\n-&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/turnscript&gt;\n\n&lt;function name=&quot;show_turns_function&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; msg (&quot;Game Turns: &quot; + game.turns)\n-&gt; msg (&quot;Player Turns: &quot; + player.turns)\n-&gt; msg (&quot;HK Turns: &quot; + HK.turns)\n-&gt; msg (&quot;Turns Clock Turns: &quot; + turns_clock.turns)\n&lt;/function&gt;\n\n&lt;command name=&quot;show_turns_command&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;pattern&gt;show turns&lt;/pattern&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;script&gt;\n-&gt;-&gt; show_turns_function\n-&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/command&gt;\n\n[quote=&quot;blackstar&quot;:oyfsbmks]This would mean that I create the custom verb &quot;chose&quot; in order to either chose the &quot;male&quot; object or the &quot;female&quot; object.\nNow I am relying upon an If-function so it goes basically like this:\n\nIf player &quot;chose&quot; &quot;male&quot; then attach &quot;male&quot;-attribute to player object. (or set male to 1) Else do nothing.\nIf player &quot;chose&quot; female&quot; then attach &quot;female&quot;-attribute to player object. (or set female to 1) Else do nothing.\n\nSo I've set up a global_data_object just as HK mentioned and added two attributes to it:\n&quot;playermale&quot;\n&quot;playerfemale&quot;\n\nboth bolean with &quot;false&quot; as value.\n\nSo this means I have to change the script towards this:\n\nIf player &quot;chose&quot; &quot;male&quot; then change &quot;playermale&quot;-attribute to &quot;true&quot;. Else do nothing.\nIf player &quot;chose&quot; female&quot; then change &quot;playerfemale&quot;-attribute to &quot;true&quot;. Else do nothing.\n\nAnd since this made some problems I removed the global_data_object and attached &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; onto the &quot;player&quot;-object to simplify it's use. Both are initially set onto &quot;false&quot; in order to give the player the choice and lead him further once one of them is set to &quot;true&quot;. I've tried to simplify it in order to wait for specific input.\n\nSo my problem now is that the game needs to recognize that when the player enters &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; his character becomes so and therefore change the attached player-attribute &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; to true.[/quote:oyfsbmks]\n\n[code:oyfsbmks]&lt;function name=&quot;gender_string_creation_function&quot; parameters=&quot;object_x&quot;&gt;\n    msg (&quot;What is your gender?&quot;)\n\tmsg (&quot;(1) male or (2) female&quot;)\n\tget input {\n\t  if (IsNumeric (result) = true) {\n\t    if (result = &quot;1&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;gender_string = &quot;male&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else if (result = &quot;2&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;gender_string = &quot;female&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else {\n\t      ClearScreen\n\t      gender_string_creation_function (object_x)\n\t\t}\n\t  } else if (IsNumeric (result) = false) {\n\t    if (result = &quot;m&quot; or result = &quot;male&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;gender_string = &quot;male&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else if (result = &quot;f&quot; or result = &quot;female&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;gender_string = &quot;female&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t  gender_string_creation_function (object_x)\n\t\t}\n\t  }\n\t}\n  &lt;/function&gt;[/code:oyfsbmks]\n\n[code:oyfsbmks]&lt;function name=&quot;race_string_creation_function&quot; parameters=&quot;object_x&quot;&gt;\n    msg (&quot;What is your race?&quot;)\n\tmsg (&quot;(1) european, (2) asian, (3) african, or (4) american&quot;)\n\tget input {\n\t  if (IsNumeric (result) = true) {\n\t    if (result = &quot;1&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;race_string = &quot;european&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else if (result = &quot;2&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;race_string = &quot;asian&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else if (result = &quot;3&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;race_string = &quot;african&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else if (result = &quot;4&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;race_string = &quot;american&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else {\n\t      ClearScreen\n\t      race_string_creation_function (object_x)\n\t\t}\n\t  } else if (IsNumeric (result) = false) {\n\t    if (result = &quot;eu&quot; or result = &quot;european&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;race_string = &quot;european&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else if (result = &quot;as&quot; or result = &quot;asian&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;race_string = &quot;asian&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else if (result = &quot;af&quot; or result = &quot;african&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;race_string = &quot;african&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else if (result = &quot;am&quot; or result = &quot;american&quot;) {\n\t\t  object_x&#46;race_string = &quot;american&quot;\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t  ClearScreen\n\t\t  race_string_creation_function (object_x)\n\t\t}\n\t  }\n\t}\n  &lt;/function&gt;[/code:oyfsbmks]\n\n[code:oyfsbmks]&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;d83ba5bb-2e3c-4f31-80c9-3e88a2dc082c&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2013&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n    &lt;gender_x type=&quot;simplestringlist&quot;&gt;male;female&lt;/gender_x&gt;\n    &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n      test_function\n    &lt;/start&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;function name=&quot;test_function&quot;&gt;\n    x=0\n    foreach (string_x, game&#46;gender_x) {\n      x=x+1\n      msg (x + &quot;&#46; &quot; + string_x)\n    }\n    msg (&quot;What is your choice?&quot;)\n    get input {\n      choice_x = result\n      if (choice_x = &quot;1&quot; or choice_x = &quot;male&quot;) {\n        msg (&quot;yes male&quot;)\n      } else if (choice_x = &quot;2&quot; or choice_x = &quot;female&quot;) {\n        msg (&quot;yes female&quot;)\n      }\n\t  on ready {\n        show menu (&quot;Do you want to do it again?&quot;, split (&quot;yes;no&quot;,&quot;;&quot;), false) {\n          if (result=&quot;yes&quot;) {\n            test_function\n          } else if (result=&quot;no&quot;) {\n            msg (&quot;you've choosen to stop&quot;)\n\t\t  }\n        }\n\t  }\n    }\n  &lt;/function&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:oyfsbmks]",

(or set male to 1) Else do nothing.<br/>If player &quot;chose&quot; female&quot; then attach &quot;female&quot;-attribute to player object. (or set female to 1) Else do nothing.<br/><br/>So I've set up a global_data_object just as HK mentioned and added two attributes to it:<br/>&quot;playermale&quot;<br/>&quot;playerfemale&quot;<br/><br/>both bolean with &quot;false&quot; as value.<br/><br/>So this means I have to change the script towards this:<br/><br/>If player &quot;chose&quot; &quot;male&quot; then change &quot;playermale&quot;-attribute to &quot;true&quot;. Else do nothing.<br/>If player &quot;chose&quot; female&quot; then change &quot;playerfemale&quot;-attribute to &quot;true&quot;. Else do nothing.<br/><br/>And since this made some problems I removed the global_data_object and attached &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; onto the &quot;player&quot;-object to simplify it's use. Both are initially set onto &quot;false&quot; in order to give the player the choice and lead him further once one of them is set to &quot;true&quot;. I've tried to simplify it in order to wait for specific input.<br/><br/>So my problem now is that the game needs to recognize that when the player enters &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; his character becomes so and therefore change the attached player-attribute &quot;male&quot;
