      "EditableText": "Hey all,\n\nNew to using Quest. I'm a programmer and I've done games in the past, but I'm bored and wanted to try out creating text adventure games. It's definitely different from the Inform engine in some ways. Specifically I noticed that there aren't built in mechanics for boxes and ladders like there are in Inform.\n\nFor example, standing on a box or a ladder should make some objects accessible. There are 'features' for edible or switchable but no 'standable'. I started using my own flags for standing on things, but I can see this getting kind of hairy. Like, if I had a ladder and a box, and I only used object flags, I would have to do a lot of drop down selecting to ensure that they cannot both stand on the ladder and on the box at the same time.\n\nI noticed others talking about using JavaScript for complex interactions, which I'm all about. However it seems to only be robustly available on Windows. The website just provides the smallest text area to add JavaScript. And I would imagine it's probably not easy to debug that script from the website.\n\nHow do others implement &quot;standing on&quot; functionality? Is anyone else using JavaScript heavily while on the website?\n\nThanks!\n- Farley",
