      "EditableText": "Hallo. I'm trying to figure out how to work on Quest in the Gamebook mode, since I wold like to have my project readable just as an old school gamebook. I decided against using Squiffy because in my project there are lots of variables to set and check all the time, and it seemed to me that Quest was more complete on that side. The problem is: the tutorial il mostly written on the point of view of the Text Adventure. It is explained very well how that works, but the part about the gamebook just gives a few very basic informations about moving from one page to the next, but nothing about how to set, modify and show the variables. \r\nLet's say I have a Life score, a Stamina score, and a Good /Evil percentage score. How do I set those variable? How do I add or subtract something from them? How do I show the value of them? I would like life and stamina to be visible all the time at the top of the page, and Good / Evil just when they are changed or checked.\r\nMaybe I should just reconsider and go back to Squiffy?",

      "EditableText": "All of these things are possible using the game book mode. I did it as a test once. However, the GUI is not as gentle to the user on Game Book mode as it is on Text Adventure mode. There is a simple solution i have been using right now: where it is written \"room\", read as \"page\". Yeah. That's simple. You create exists, but never use the directional exits, using the alias to place all the text you want, such as \"Phillip chooses to run away\" or \"Phillip decides facing the evil stepfather\". You will have all the game support for using starts, variables and even have the stats and inventory if you wish. You may use hit points, skill levels and adding items the players already collected, even if you give up the command bar, you still may use the \"look at\" button to give or remember details about the item to the player.\r\n\r\nI have been planning myself a few different uses (different from what i seem so far) to implement game books using the Text Adventure resources to deal with character constructions and task resolution.\r\n\r\nAfter making just a few tests i found how easy it is is when you get the right idea and find some useful tips. For example, i have a game book halted at the moment, as i decided going on a side project to study tools. The halted project has command bar removed and compass removed, but keeps all other player stats functions.\r\n\r\nIf you need further details on specifics, just ask and community (and myself, of course) will help you!",

      "EditableText": "I had a hard time using a simple game engine in a game book once, because as game books has no panes, I had to create a page to be the character sheet and then create a variable to track the last page read in order to allow the player return to the right page after checking the character sheet. \r\n\r\nMaking a game book using the Text Adventure mode allows the designer keeping the pane  (perhaps you may want removing the compass ) and dealing with attributes in a clean, easy and well documented manner. \r\n\r\nThe most usual way is creating a room, place your first page text there, create two exists and points it to other two rooms. Instead of using the directions for these exists, keep it non directional and use the alias to describe the option given. \r\n\r\nI am also using an alternative method on one of my game books which involves creating an object wich is the task resolution. Each verb for the object gives you an action or for better understanding, a choice. When player uses the button, the player object is moved to the page  (in this case a room, but they are the same )adequate to that option. \r\n\r\nUsing a text adventure as a game book also adds an interesting option to spice things up. Lets say a given scene involves a park. The page describes the park, the day, the people and what the character feels. You would add side information to the scene by creating multiple objects and using the look at option in order to provide more, lateral description. The park would contain objects like trees, people, grass, sun and smell in the air. Using the \"look at\" option, the player gets extra description about each element. \r\n\r\nYou may use that to hide other informations or check attributes. So when player looks to people game has the standard description and the alternative description for passing a \"contacts\" check, revealing there are some members of the city council in the park. A sniff in the air may check the player's \"nature\" skill and tell it will probably rain in a few hours. And it goes. ",
