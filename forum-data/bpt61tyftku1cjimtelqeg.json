      "EditableText": "Right now, you can put a page link inside of an if check. This allows for having page links conditionally seen based on the check. But you can't put checks inside of pagelinks; pagelinks show all text inside of them.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for a situation where I want a link to go to a single page, but display different text based on the situation. \r\nFor instance, if the link is to leave a room. I want the link to acknowledge whether you have a friend with you, and state that your friend will leave with you. But if you are alone, it shouldn't display the same text. \r\n\r\nThere are ways to get around this; create two separate links with different text, for instance, or just find ways to word it that make it clear outside of the link that your friend will leave with you. Nonetheless, I think it would be really useful if you could just pop an if check inside a page link.",
