I am, however, really struggling to get NPC interactions working correctly. \r\n\r\nI have looked at the tutorials and searched on Google but... I have literally zero coding knowledge and all the explanations only use coding. I'm using Quest on a Mac (so in-browser) so I don't have access to conversation libraries. \r\n\r\nI'm looking to have structured conversations where the player chooses from a list of options to advance:\r\n\r\n\"Hi,\" John says. \"How are you?\"\r\n\r\nYou respond:\r\n1 - \"Good\"\r\n2 - \"Bad\"\r\n3 - \"Banana\"\r\n\r\nEtc. \r\n\r\nIs anyone able to point me in the direction of a resource that will show me how to do this without coding (i.e., using the web interface)?\r\n\r\nThank you!",
