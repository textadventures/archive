Rather than allowing the player to save whenever they want to, I'd like to have &quot;checkpoints&quot; of sorts...that is, the game will save automatically at certain places in the storyline, and the player can choose to go back to any of those points at any time. That way, I can allow the player to make &quot;mistakes&quot; in the game and have to rewind to try again.\n\nIs this possible?",

Informing your players to do mutliple &quot;save as...&quot;'s seems like the easiest route.  I don't think there is a script command to restore a saved QSG file.  In other words, as of now, I think you'd have to play around with creating your own internal save and load commands, and develop a way to capture the entire state of your game internally (every variable, object, object property, location, etc.).",

The way mine works is that when the player walks into a potential dangerous area, a window pops up and asks the player if he/she wants to save the game.  If yes, the game will save.  HOWEVER, it doesn't do it invisibly.  It will pop open the save as menu and you navigate to where you want to save the game.  I do not know offhand how to make the game save without seeing this option.  It would seem that if it's possible, the player would still have to initially save the game and later auto saves will save over that file.",
