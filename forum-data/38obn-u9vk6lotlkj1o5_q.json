The second reason is that in many game books, players has to guess what the author means with a given option and frequently the player is not informed about how the character will perform that action. By having Objects as choices, i may add the details inside the \"Look at\" description, without accumulating a lot of text to the main page. Player will inspects only what is desired. \r\n\r\nSo, here comes my first question. I plan placing the resolution of action to run as scripts for the \"Use\" button of the Objects which represents choices. Is there a way to group similar choices on the same Object without having to add commands to the game?\r\n\r\nEx: Object named \"Enter the Locker Room\". Buttons the Object has: \"Look at\", \"Walk Inside\" and  \"Sneak Inside\". Is it possible (and simple) adding buttons to an Object and make it work in the same simplicity as the \"Use\" button?",
