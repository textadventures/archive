Just seeking feedback on how things should work, and I imagine this will get more attention in the actual Quest forum.\r\n\r\nIn Quest 6, there's an easy way to have NPCs moving around in the game and/or following the player (or other NPCs).  So, say Ralph is following you.  You enter a room, and, after the room description prints, it will print something like: \"Ralph enters from the east.\"\r\n\r\nWell, what if it's dark in the current room?  What should happen by default?  Should Quest simply <u>not</u> report an NPC entering the room in the dark?\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Quote from The Pixie on GitHub:\r\n> I am trying to think the best way to do this. What do you *want* to happen?\r\n>\r\n> Do you want the player to get a message; \"You hear someone enter the room.\" If so, would that depend on the NPC - you do not hear the ninja for example? Would it depend on the room? If yes to either of these, where would you want to put the strings?\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis seems like a good question for the Quest forum.",
