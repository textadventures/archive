This concerns the large area of square boxes under the exits edit tab:\r\n\r\n1. while all the compass directions are marked with both a name (north) and an arrow, and 2 additional exits are marked with a name (in, out) and an arrow, the exits for up and down do not have a name. Suggest adding a name.\r\n\r\n2. there is no exit option on the visual editor for non-directional exits. This requires creating an exit with one of the defined directions and then editing both the exit from the room, and the exit back to the room to be non-directional. Can this be fixed, please.",
