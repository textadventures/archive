I click the drop box menu to choose a gender and when I click on the gender I want (male or female) and I click submit, nothing happens. I got the drop box menu code from ai but everything they give me to complete the submission of being able to choose your own gender, it doesn't work, I press submit and it does nothing, I am really confuse on how to complete the gender dropbox menu. If someone could help, I would greatly appreciate it!",
