I'm making a text adventure where the actions you do take up time, in minutes. What I need to learn how to do is to make various actions take up time. I want a 'status' of what time it is that updates each time a player performs an action. I'd really like it if I could customized each of the actions to be various times - from 1 to 35 minutes. The minutes aren't random but set so that if a player wants to brush his teeth it will add 5 minutes to his status.\n\nBasically, the game is about a 16 hour day that a player gets to do what they want in it. Also, I need the game to start at 7am and end at 11pm. I've covered everything else, it's just that this time thing is confusing me. If anyone could help me on this matter, I'd greatly appreciate it.",
