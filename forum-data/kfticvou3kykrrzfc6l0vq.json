I have started to make my own story/game and learning the principle of writing stories and the code. But several things were not working well, and I realized the code works interpreted by Scratchpad on the website, but not in the Mac desktop app. Then I saw the Mac app is version 5.00 and issued in 2015 where the Windows/Linux version is 5.1.3, fixes some bugs, and issued in 2019. My question is : has the Mac desktop app version been abandoned or someone is maintaining this version ? Or do I need to get the sources and to compile the program myself on my Mac ? Is this going to work ?\r\nThanks for your help.",
