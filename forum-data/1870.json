I have certain sound effects when things occur, but they are not playing or are waiting to play when they shouldn't.  I'm using Vista.  Is anyone else experiencing a similar problem?",

      "EditableText": "Hey P1, thanks for the lengthy, in-depth reply.\n\nI'm using SPS-25 sound card in Cakewalk's Sonar Power Studio 250 audio interface.  I've been using this device for about a year for everything from recording/playback of large music files, movies, internet sites, games, etc., and have not experienced any problems whatsoever.\n\nWhat's happening is my first sound effect chimes correctly, but the second sound effect sometimes plays or sometimes doesn't, and if it does, it plays the incorrect amount of times (usually only once) and late; I say &quot;late,&quot; because each sound effect should ring as text blinks on the screen.  The third sound effect plays, but many seconds after it should.  I tries &quot;synchronizing&quot; as Alex requested, but although this allowed all sounds to play correctly and on time, instead of the correct time lapse of the text, it slowed the whole sequence of text/sound events down by about 400%.\n\n[color=#FF0000:1hwlnqck]So I tried switching to the sound card in my computer, and everything worked right.[/color:1hwlnqck]  So it definitely has something to do with Quest and SPS-25 sound card connection, because every other instance of sound playback using SPS-25 has worked fine.  But I have to open up Sonar recording software, readjust sound card choice, switch headphone jacks, yada yada yada to have to switch back and forth when I want to use Quest.  I'd like to see if there's a solution, so I can just use SPS-25. (Cakewalk program doesn't work well with computer's sound card).\n\nSo there's nothing wrong with Vista, my code, or any other reason, except between Quest and SPS-25, specifically.\n\nAny other ideas would be greatly appreciated.",
