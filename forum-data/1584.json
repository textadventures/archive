Most of them political.<br/>EVERYTHING has to be under this GPL umbrella, which means the drivers HAVE to be open source or else it's a bastard to install/configure.<br/><br/>Saying that, things seem to be running better now that the dependencies are sorted out.. Plus I have firefox 2 again... which is VERY weird as I seem to remember only 1.5 being available through yum.<br/><br/>I use Linux for basically 99.9% of my home life, and 50% of my working life (purely because windows is installed on my PC at work by force/default).<br/><br/>.. I did choose a notoriously middle-ground linux distro though.. Not easy-peasy and not hard-as-nails.<br/>- Plus, anyone who knows me knows I have to change EVERYTHING to be just perfect for me.. So half of that has got to be the reason it's been harder this time around.<br/>I can say a fair amount of my problems were my own damn fault!<br/><br/>Overall, not bad.. 3 days outage for doing 2 jobs: sorting out my hard drives and upgrading Linux.",
