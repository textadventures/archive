      "EditableText": "Yeah, making in for Quest, coding in ASL. The user makes their game like some muds do it, they log in and use special commands to add rooms, etc. Alex needs to sort out those saving bugs (repetition of lines, etc), otherwise the save file going to be huge though. They have to save before shutting the server down otherwise the game is lost. Only thing I'm having trouble with atm is them making races, as races have multiple choices on features such as hair, eye colour and so forth (any suggestions are nice). The commands are usually stuff like '/create room bar1, Tavern' (after comma is alias), and '/edit object desc Meep'. Also the object creating system is mad atm as it has types, bases, etc (hierarchical) but makes it once you've put a few items in, making new similar ones is nicer. So any object may by like 'clothing/shirt/redshirt/redshirhclone001' basically 'type/subtype/base/clone'. It's being made for TMSC, she posted ages ago asking for help and I've been working on it since then, on and off. It has some nifty features, I may start a thread about it once I've got some more work on it done so people can have a mess with it and tell me what they think so far. ^_^",
