Whatever the hero chooses, it is clear that the village is not an easy place to make a living anymore, and people started to take faraway quests like dragon of atlantis in search of a better place to build a house. The island of atlantis is a very particular area, because it is reigned by an ice dragon, the prince would not be able to claim that territory and so he released a strange quest upon the very inn that the hero step into.\r\n\r\nThis quest, Dragon of Atlantis offers 1000 gold to anyone who slays the dragon of atlantis, however, we all know what comes after that, rumours started spreading that the prince will claim that atlantis island as his own too. Then the people of saltwind settlement will have less places to forage for fishes and deers.

There are jobs available for ship builders. It seems like the prince is trying to build a naval army even though the advisor is against the idea.\r\n\r\nMap - The atlantis is an island with many steep slopes and unnatural caverns and tunnels. The hero have to navigate through the seas towards this island which is easily missable because of its small area size.\r\n\r\nEnemies - We already planted in many enemies that were of human, how about we add in prince's soldiers, the mansion previous owner and his family, deers, deers monsters, immigrants chased out of their own house from another village which is claimed by the new prince.\r\n\r\nItems - Eventually the hero have to slay the dragon, some iconic items can be weapons or armours featured in legends of other quests.
