I was inspired by games like Anna: Extended Version, and Penumbra: Black Plague. Mechanically speaking, it is winnable. There's a lot to figure out, though. If you get stuck, you can either type \"help\" or \"hint\". All the music and sound effects are from the Youtube music library, free for use. The artwork is in the public domain, and the photos are marked as \"for reuse with modification\", \"labeled for reuse\" \"for non-commercial use\", by the google search filter.\r\n\r\nI tried to make it interesting, without making the story too obvious. You'll have to explore a lot to piece together the whole truth of what's going on, hopefully. Tell me what you think. Was it scary enough? Were the puzzles too easy or too hard? Any glitches?Playthrough transcripts would be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nPlay here: http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/7pxk_ils9kysq8rrzcczjw/simon-says-demo-version",

      "EditableText": "Thanks for the feedback. \r\n I'm going to work on making the commands more consistent. The command in this case is \"use match on candle\" and then you will be able to see the stuff in the room.\r\n A lot of the time there will be different commands required than the ones on the menu. You'll have to type them in.  I'm going to work on cleaning the game up by getting rid of non-functional menu options such as light candle.\r\n I didn't think about adding a description for when the match is first lit, but before it is used on the candle. I'll think about it, but I'm not sure it's necessary. I considered it to be a very weak light source primarily used for lighting stronger light sources, so not that important. But I can see how it would be important for realism, and it would probably be off-putting for the player if they couldn't see it at that point.\r\nYou can \"Ask voice about -\" and \"Tell voice about\", but otherwise he speaks whenever he is programmed to. You can recognize him by the typewriter effect, when he is calm, and the unscrambling when he is flustered or angry. \r\n\r\nThe fireplace is to the left.\r\n\r\n",
