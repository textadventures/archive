      "EditableText": "For what it's worth, here are my reviews. Sorry they're not very complimentary, but I'd be hard pressed to find a thing about any of the games that was actually worth complimenting.  <!-- s:cry: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Crying or Very Sad\" /><!-- s:cry: --> \n\n\nQuest 4 recently came out so when I saw a number of new games had been uploaded to the main site, I decided to try them out and see what the new version had to offer. Unfortunately, two of the games are written with the previous version of Quest so whatever jazzy new features version 4 brings with it wonâ€™t matter much to them. Oh well, Iâ€™d downloaded them so figured I might as well give them a bash and see what was whatâ€¦\n\nThe first one I tried was Escape From The House which gave the indication from the very start of being just as bad as every other Quest game that Iâ€™d played. The introduction was:\n\nYou need to find a way out of this house\n\nHardly inspires you to play any further, does it? From there it went from bad to worse. The first location description is littered with spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and weird capitalisation. At the end of it, I'm advised\n\nThere exit Norh take you to the Small Hall\n\nAnd this is at the very start of the game where people are most likely to quit if they donâ€™t see anything very favourable! Now I can understand being new to the scene and not really knowing what things are standard as far as text adventures are concerned, but even the newest newbie of them all should realise that terrible spelling at the very start of their game doesnâ€™t give a good first impression.\n\nPlaying a little further, I noticed Escape From The House suffered from the usual array of faults which seem to blight almost every Quest game I've ever played. There's a desk with a drawer in it, but the OPEN command isn't recognised; another location has a lavish table that canâ€™t be referred to as TABLE or LAVISH TABLE but only as DINING TABLE; many items mentioned in room descriptions canâ€™t be examined and those that can have short, uninspiring descriptions often littered with spelling mistakes; there are items that should be readable but the READ command isn't understoodâ€¦ (1 out of 10)\n\nI went on to another game by the same author â€“ Whereâ€™s Annabel? Â¬â€“ not really expecting much and, yes, not really getting much either.\n\nThis one had an introduction at least, though the authorâ€™s spelling and grammar haven't improved much since Escape From The House. Nor has his ability to know where capitals are and are not needed. And heâ€™s still a long, long way from writing something even vaguely playableâ€¦\n\nQuest has the strange habit of displaying the items (both ones you can pick up and immovable ones) in bold type before the main body of the text in the room description, which is a bad idea to say the least and compounded here by the author then going on to repeat most of what you have already been told. So the first room description reads:\n\nYou are in the main Garden.\nThere is a closed Well, some Yellow Flowers, some White Flowers, some Red Flowers and some Blue Flowers here.\nYou can go west.\nYou are standing in a small garden.  There is a large well here and it is overgrown with colourful flowers\n\nAs I've already been told there's a well and some flowers here, is it really necessary to incorporate them into the room description as well?\n\nWhat age the game is in set I couldnâ€™t say. At one time you are given gold coins, which led me to assume it was way back in the Dark Ages, but at the same time you're given a photograph so itâ€™s clearly not a medieval game. Unfortunately the author doesnâ€™t seem willing to elaborate on things. Then again, little about the game is clear. For a start: who is the player? The background to the game is that someone called Annabel has gone missing (this is detailed in the remarkably clumsy introduction) and you have to find her, yet whether you're a police officer, a freelance detective or something else altogether is never indicated. Part of me suspects even the author doesnâ€™t know.\n\nI didnâ€™t last long with Whereâ€™s Annabel? Mainly because it was just so bad I was on the verge of quitting before Iâ€™d even finished reading the introduction, but also because of the remarkably small amount of commands it understands and the frequent bugs. Not to mention some of the worst guess the verb problems I've ever come across. A good example of this would be:\n\nYou're given a photograph of Annabel. Now with a photograph, the logical thing to do would be to SHOW it to people, right? Ah, but the game doesnâ€™t understand the SHOW command. It does understand GIVE funnily enough but wonâ€™t let me give it away because I need to keep hold of it. USE PHOTOGRAPH when speaking to an NPC called Baggie produces an unhelpful message that I canâ€™t use it here. At this I got stumped and started typing in silly things just to see if I could hit upon the solution by sheer luck. And I did. The command required?\n\nUSE PHOTOGRAPH ON BAGGIE\n\nAh, of course. What an amazingly obvious command. USE PHOTOGRAPH ON BAGGIE is so much better than SHOW PHOTOGRAPH.\n\nOkay, enough with the sarcasm and enough with the game. Avoid this one like the stinker it is. (1 out of 10)\n\nSo onto the next one â€“ Nami AdventureÂ¬ â€“ one of the first ever games written with Quest 4. As this was a brand new text adventure system, I wasnâ€™t really sure what to expect other than it being an improved version of the old Quest. Improved? Well, in theoryâ€¦ \n\nAt first glance, the interface appears the same as the old version. The side panels are still in place (although why they're even there in the first place beats me as they add absolutely nothing to any of the Quest games I've played), the text entry line is still minimal andâ€¦ thatâ€™s about it. Whatever other changes have taken place aren't immediately apparent, with the only obvious difference being that some of the buttons now have a nicer box around them than before.\n\nAs for the gameâ€¦\n\nOh dear god.\n\nFor some reason that probably seemed like a good idea to the writer, but sure doesnâ€™t to this poor player, the game clears the screen after every single command. Yes, every single one. So if you examine an item, the screen clears. If you try to open something, the screen clears. In fact, even if you make a typo, the screen clears just to tell you it doesnâ€™t understand what you mean. Now while I quite like screen clearing for moving between locations â€“ it keeps the interface looking nice and tidy â€“ for every command itâ€™s just the worst idea possible. Seriously. By the time I quit the game, and it wasnâ€™t long believe me, over half the commands Iâ€™d typed were LOOK just so I could see where I was.\n\nUnfortunately, this made playing the game a real chore. Location descriptions are as painfully brief as they generally are in Quest games, usually a line or two at most, and Quest has still got the peculiar habit of preceding room descriptions with a list of the items that you can see in bold type. Funnily enough, one of these items is the player character, though why the writer felt the need to list the PC as one of the items in the room is beyond me.\n\nWhat bit I played of the game didnâ€™t impress me one bit. Yet again, it seemed to be a Quest game written by someone without a clue what they were doing, hadnâ€™t been tested, didnâ€™t have any clear storyline and, burdened by the screen clearing after every command, was just more trouble than it was worth. (1 out of 10)\n\nI then moved on to the final game, Something â€˜Bout A Hex, which certainly had a better blurb than the previous games but which crashed with an error message whenever I tried to play it. After some experimentation, it seems that this is another Quest 4 game but the error message never indicated this and so Iâ€™d blindly assumed it was still the older version. But I fired it up in the new Quest 4 and tried it. Hey presto! It worked!\n\nTo begin with, it didnâ€™t seem too bad. The first location had an actual honest to god description which was more than a few lines long. It even listed a huge array of items. Wa-hey! Something to examine, I thought. Unfortunately notâ€¦ as while there might be items listed in the room description, the writer hasnâ€™t bothered providing descriptions for any that I could find. A sample from my transcript went:\n\n&gt; X MANTLE\nI CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.\n\n&gt; X PISTON\nI CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.\n\n&gt; X FISHTANK\nI CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.\n\n&gt; X FIREPLACE\nI CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.\n\n&gt; X DRIED ROSE\nI CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.\n\nEtcâ€¦\n\nIf one of those had been missed, Iâ€™d probably just chalk it down to simple carelessness and leave it at that. If two had been missed, Iâ€™d wonder if the writer needed to get himself a better set of testers. But with all of them missedâ€¦ well, if this game even knows what a tester looks like, Iâ€™d be very surprised.\n\n(As a side note, Quest now has a transcript command. I figured this out pretty much hit and miss as it doesnâ€™t detail it anywhere in the game and the WHATâ€™S NEW section under the HELP options button doesnâ€™t work. On the down side, the transcript is a remarkably poor one as it doesnâ€™t display any of the text generated by your commands, only the commands themselves, rendering its use as a transcript tool pretty much non-existent. You also donâ€™t receive any confirmation when starting or stopping a transcript and no indication of where the file has been saved. You're not even able to name the transcript which is another failing.)\n\nLeaving the first location presented me with a slight problem: namely that I couldnâ€™t return. The exit had, apparently, gone missing. Other locations presented other problems. One had a door which couldnâ€™t be opened as the OPEN command wasnâ€™t recognised (up to version 4 and Quest still doesnâ€™t understand many of the basic IF commands that every other system has had for years); another had a desk which I needed to GO TO DESK before I could do anything with it (although even when standing right next to it I was told I CANâ€™T SEE THAT HERE when attempting to examine it). Many locations lacked anything more than a line telling you where you were and the exits, so any attempts at depth the game might have been going for were quickly lost.\n\nIn fact, there were so many things wrong with the game that I was itching to quit it before five minutes had even gone by. For a start, there's no storyline. The intro hints at something about time travel and a hex, which sounded vaguely interesting for a few moments, but the game begins with you pottering around your apartment and wonâ€™t let you leave becauseâ€¦ well, it doesnâ€™t say why. Most of the locations are sparsely implemented (and thatâ€™s being kind) with nothing at all to do in the majority of them. Interaction is mainly done via the side panels and involves you clicking one thing then another. Which is a pain. Iâ€™d quite like to see Quest lose the side panels altogether or for them to at least be a little more user friendly. Or for someone to write a Quest game that doesnâ€™t require their use at all.\n\nIt might seem a little harsh to give yet another rating of 1 out of 10 for this, but there's nothing about it I could recommend so thatâ€™s the rating I'm going to give it.

There's a desk with a drawer in it, but the OPEN command isn't recognised; another location has a lavish table that canâ€™t be referred to as TABLE or LAVISH TABLE but only as DINING TABLE; many items mentioned in room descriptions canâ€™t be examined and those that can have short, uninspiring descriptions often littered with spelling mistakes; there are items that should be readable but the READ command isn't understoodâ€¦ (1 out of 10)<br/><br/>I went on to another game by the same author â€“ Whereâ€™s Annabel? Â¬â€“ not really expecting much and, yes, not really getting much either.<br/><br/>This one had an introduction at least, though the authorâ€™s spelling and grammar haven't improved much since Escape From The House. Nor has his ability to know where capitals are and are not needed. And heâ€™s still a long, long way from writing something even vaguely playableâ€¦<br/><br/>Quest has the strange habit of displaying the items (both ones you can pick up and immovable ones) in bold type before the main body of the text in the room description, which is a bad idea to say the least and compounded here by the author then going on to repeat most of what you have already been told. So the first room description reads:<br/><br/>You are in the main Garden.<br/>There is a closed Well, some Yellow Flowers, some White Flowers, some Red Flowers and some Blue Flowers here.<br/>You can go west.<br/>You are standing in a small garden.  There is a large well here and it is overgrown with colourful flowers<br/><br/>As I've already been told there's a well and some flowers here, is it really necessary to incorporate them into the room description as well?<br/><br/>What age the game is in set I couldnâ€™t say. At one time you are given gold coins, which led me to assume it was way back in the Dark Ages, but at the same time you're given a photograph so itâ€™s clearly not a medieval game. Unfortunately the author doesnâ€™t seem willing to elaborate on things. Then again, little about the game is clear. For a start: who is the player? The background to the game is that someone called Annabel has gone missing (this is detailed in the remarkably clumsy introduction) and you have to find her, yet whether you're a police officer, a freelance detective or something else altogether is never indicated. Part of me suspects even the author doesnâ€™t know.<br/><br/>I didnâ€™t last long with Whereâ€™s Annabel? Mainly because it was just so bad I was on the verge of quitting before Iâ€™d even finished reading the introduction, but also because of the remarkably small amount of commands it understands and the frequent bugs. Not to mention some of the worst guess the verb problems I've ever come across. A good example of this would be:<br/><br/>You're given a photograph of Annabel. Now with a photograph, the logical thing to do would be to SHOW it to people, right? Ah, but the game doesnâ€™t understand the SHOW command. It does understand GIVE funnily enough but wonâ€™t let me give it away because I need to keep hold of it. USE PHOTOGRAPH when speaking to an NPC called Baggie produces an unhelpful message that I canâ€™t use it here. At this I got stumped and started typing in silly things just to see if I could hit upon the solution by sheer luck. And I did. The command required?<br/><br/>USE PHOTOGRAPH ON BAGGIE<br/><br/>Ah, of course. What an amazingly obvious command. USE PHOTOGRAPH ON BAGGIE is so much better than SHOW PHOTOGRAPH.<br/><br/>Okay, enough with the sarcasm and enough with the game. Avoid this one like the stinker it is. (1 out of 10)<br/><br/>So onto the next one â€“ Nami AdventureÂ¬ â€“ one of the first ever games written with Quest 4. As this was a brand new text adventure system, I wasnâ€™t really sure what to expect other than it being an improved version of the old Quest. Improved? Well, in theoryâ€¦ <br/><br/>At first glance, the interface appears the same as the old version. The side panels are still in place (although why they're even there in the first place beats me as they add absolutely nothing to any of the Quest games I've played), the text entry line is still minimal andâ€¦ thatâ€™s about it. Whatever other changes have taken place aren't immediately apparent, with the only obvious difference being that some of the buttons now have a nicer box around them than before.<br/><br/>As for the gameâ€¦<br/><br/>Oh dear god.<br/><br/>For some reason that probably seemed like a good idea to the writer, but sure doesnâ€™t to this poor player, the game clears the screen after every single command. Yes, every single one. So if you examine an item, the screen clears. If you try to open something, the screen clears. In fact, even if you make a typo, the screen clears just to tell you it doesnâ€™t understand what you mean. Now while I quite like screen clearing for moving between locations â€“ it keeps the interface looking nice and tidy â€“ for every command itâ€™s just the worst idea possible. Seriously. By the time I quit the game, and it wasnâ€™t long believe me, over half the commands Iâ€™d typed were LOOK just so I could see where I was.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this made playing the game a real chore. Location descriptions are as painfully brief as they generally are in Quest games, usually a line or two at most, and Quest has still got the peculiar habit of preceding room descriptions with a list of the items that you can see in bold type. Funnily enough, one of these items is the player character, though why the writer felt the need to list the PC as one of the items in the room is beyond me.<br/><br/>What bit I played of the game didnâ€™t impress me one bit. Yet again, it seemed to be a Quest game written by someone without a clue what they were doing, hadnâ€™t been tested, didnâ€™t have any clear storyline and, burdened by the screen clearing after every command, was just more trouble than it was worth. (1 out of 10)<br/><br/>I then moved on to the final game, Something â€˜Bout A Hex, which certainly had a better blurb than the previous games but which crashed with an error message whenever I tried to play it. After some experimentation, it seems that this is another Quest 4 game but the error message never indicated this and so Iâ€™d blindly assumed it was still the older version. But I fired it up in the new Quest 4 and tried it. Hey presto! It worked!<br/><br/>To begin with, it didnâ€™t seem too bad. The first location had an actual honest to god description which was more than a few lines long. It even listed a huge array of items. Wa-hey! Something to examine, I thought. Unfortunately notâ€¦ as while there might be items listed in the room description, the writer hasnâ€™t bothered providing descriptions for any that I could find. A sample from my transcript went:<br/><br/>&gt; X MANTLE<br/>I CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.<br/><br/>&gt; X PISTON<br/>I CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.<br/><br/>&gt; X FISHTANK<br/>I CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.<br/><br/>&gt; X FIREPLACE<br/>I CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.<br/><br/>&gt; X DRIED ROSE<br/>I CAN'T SEE THAT HERE.<br/><br/>Etcâ€¦<br/><br/>If one of those had been missed, Iâ€™d probably just chalk it down to simple carelessness and leave it at that. If two had been missed, Iâ€™d wonder if the writer needed to get himself a better set of testers. But with all of them missedâ€¦ well, if this game even knows what a tester looks like, Iâ€™d be very surprised.<br/><br/>(As a side note, Quest now has a transcript command. I figured this out pretty much hit and miss as it doesnâ€™t detail it anywhere in the game and the WHATâ€™S NEW section under the HELP options button doesnâ€™t work. On the down side, the transcript is a remarkably poor one as it doesnâ€™t display any of the text generated by your commands, only the commands themselves, rendering its use as a transcript tool pretty much non-existent. You also donâ€™t receive any confirmation when starting or stopping a transcript and no indication of where the file has been saved. You're not even able to name the transcript which is another failing.)<br/><br/>Leaving the first location presented me with a slight problem: namely that I couldnâ€™t return. The exit had, apparently, gone missing. Other locations presented other problems. One had a door which couldnâ€™t be opened as the OPEN command wasnâ€™t recognised (up to version 4 and Quest still doesnâ€™t understand many of the basic IF commands that every other system has had for years); another had a desk which I needed to GO TO DESK before I could do anything with it (although even when standing right next to it I was told I CANâ€™T SEE THAT HERE when attempting to examine it). Many locations lacked anything more than a line telling you where you were and the exits, so any attempts at depth the game might have been going for were quickly lost.<br/><br/>In fact, there were so many things wrong with the game that I was itching to quit it before five minutes had even gone by. For a start, there's no storyline. The intro hints at something about time travel and a hex, which sounded vaguely interesting for a few moments, but the game begins with you pottering around your apartment and wonâ€™t let you leave becauseâ€¦ well, it doesnâ€™t say why. Most of the locations are sparsely implemented (and thatâ€™s being kind) with nothing at all to do in the majority of them. Interaction is mainly done via the side panels and involves you clicking one thing then another. Which is a pain. Iâ€™d quite like to see Quest lose the side panels altogether or for them to at least be a little more user friendly. Or for someone to write a Quest game that doesnâ€™t require their use at all.<br/><br/>It might seem a little harsh to give yet another rating of 1 out of 10 for this, but there's nothing about it I could recommend so thatâ€™s the rating I'm going to give it. (1 out of 10)",

      "EditableText": "And so to the fifth and final game â€“ Steve Lingleâ€™s Kingâ€™s Quest V â€“ which I decided to make a more determined effort to get on with than the other games. Why? Well, heâ€™s written two previous games with Quest and they're far and away the best Quest games I've ever played. (Of course, considering the competition heâ€™s up againstâ€¦)\r\n\r\nThe introduction was lengthy and a bit flawed in the grammar department what with a fair number of errors showing up (the game lists several testers, though unfortunately none of them seem to know a good proofread when they see one) and some awful colour schemes. Some of the dialogue is in red, some in blue, and with the gameâ€™s main text being my preferred choice of white, this makes the whole thing seem more than a little gaudy. But a few changes from the top menu, a restart (Quest apparently canâ€™t change something as basic as the font colour without restarting), and I was away.\r\n\r\nThe ever unwelcome side panel (grrr!) is better used here than in most games, but the usual flaws are present, too. The first location lists three items that can be examined â€“ a well, a small pond and some chap called Cedric â€“ yet there is also a town and a house that you can look at as well via the old-fashioned idea of typing in commands. I can well imagine this kind of thing being highly problematic in that if you rely on only what is displayed in the side panel (as seems to be the general idea with Quest), you wouldnâ€™t be aware there were other things that could be examined. This could well lead to you missing something vital to completing the game. On the other hand, if you hide the side panel and the item you need to examine is only referred to there and not in the text itself (as has been the case a time or two before in various games) then you're potentially rendering the game unfinishable.\r\n\r\nThere's an added problem in that not everything mentioned in the side panel can be examined, though itâ€™s often not until youâ€™ve typed in several different things trying to garner a response that you become aware of this. The town location refers to a barrel, a wagon, a silver coin (apparently lying around in the middle of town though only the player has the wherewithal to pick it up) and three shops, yet none of the shops can be examined. Why? Well, according to the panel they're places and not objects and apparently places canâ€™t be examined. Hmmmâ€¦ \r\n\r\nParser problems abound. Normally I'm not too fussed over the whole parser debate, but Questâ€™s parser, and its many flaws, seem to affect every game written with it. For example, Cedric, the named NPC in the first location, cannot be referred to as HIM but, strangely enough, as IT. Even more bizarre, the sequence X CEDRIC followed by X HIM produces \r\n\r\nI don't know what 'him' you are referring to.\r\nI don't know what 'him' you are referring to.\r\nI can't see that here.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, we have parser inflexibility. GO WELL isn't an acceptable command apparently, but something like GO TO THE WELL is considered fine. Surely Quest can check a simple command like that, realise itâ€™s the same as GO WELL and process it accordingly? Then there are the usual problems with perfectly ordinary words not being understood, or with commands displaying an error message if not followed by a noun. So TALK on its own will produce the standard Quest error message, yet TALK TO [NPC] will work fine. (The problem here is that if you tried TALK on its own and got an error message, you might well assume the command didnâ€™t work in the game and not try it again.) Oh yes, Questâ€™s parser leaves a lot to be desired and has the potential to turn even a good game into something almost unplayable. Then there are the downright bizarre problems. When standing outside an inn, I attempted to GO TO THE INN and was told I couldnâ€™t go there.\r\n\r\nBut enough with the flaws of the system. What about the game itself?\r\n\r\nItâ€™s certainly better written than the average Quest game, though suffers from a poor grasp of grammar for the most part. From time to time, the game switches from first person (referring to the player as YOU) to third person (referring to the player as GRAHAM) which is a little jarring to say the least. There doesnâ€™t seem to be any real consistency to this and instead it appears to be down more to simple carelessness than anything else.\r\n\r\nInstant deaths abound, never a favourite of mine, and here there are far too many of them. The first game (this is the sequel incidentally) featured this theme as well, and no matter how many times someone can espouse on just why itâ€™s a good idea to have the player killed instantly and without warning, every time it happens to me I find myself wishing they just wouldnâ€™t bother. Why not a simple warning that the player might die? Why not put the player in peril but give them the opportunity to get out in one piece? Why not injure the player or take away score points for mistakes? Killing them every few moves is just a pain.  With Quest lacking the vital UNDO feature, dying means clicking on the restore option in the right hand panel in order to go back to your previous saved game position. (Ah, but what if youâ€™ve decided to play the game with the side panel turned off? Well, then you're up a certain creek without a certain implement because the command entry line becomes disabled when you die, thus putting you in a very sticky position indeed.) With the sheer number of instant deaths on show here, this can become very tiring very quickly. \r\n\r\nThe game compensates for this to some degree by including a feature that is every bit as annoying here as it was in the first game: namely a message flashing up on screen from time to time warning you to save your game. As with the first game, this seems like a sound idea in theory but when it happens every single time you go a certain way, it quickly becomes a pain. \r\n\r\nIn style, Kingâ€™s Quest V  is a very retro game. There are no long, flowery descriptions of locations, no details beyond the very basics, the aforementioned instant deaths and, sigh, several timers that donâ€™t really add anything to the game but a fervent wish that the author hadnâ€™t felt the need to include them. Wandering around the desert (a remarkably empty set of locations all virtually identical to each other), I died every four to five moves unless I could find an oasis and drink from it. For some reason, I couldnâ€™t seem to find a way to take any of the water with me (the player apparently lives in a world where glasses, bottles and the like do not exist) so this made exploring the desert an arduous and frustrating task. Iâ€™d find an oasis then walk around it for a bit until I got a message telling me the heat was getting to me, then run back to the oasis, have a drink, and explore a bit further. Sometimes Iâ€™d make it back in one piece. Often I wouldnâ€™t. By the time I had the desert sufficiently explored, I think Iâ€™d died half a dozen times and spent more time than I care to mention wondering just why the author had included such an ultimately annoying puzzle in his game.\r\n\r\nAlarmingly few commands seem to be covered and sometimes you need to try something else entirely just to get the game to accept the command you want. For example, I canâ€™t BUY SLED (buy is another word Quest still doesnâ€™t have in its vocabulary), yet talking to the toy shop owner begins a conversation where I try to buy the sled. \r\n\r\nI spent quite a bit longer on Kingâ€™s Quest V than I normally do with Quest games, hoping that despite its flaws there was a decent game here, but in the end the sheer number of bugs, the frequent problems with the perspective switching from first to third person, the poor standard of testing and, yes, the usual hassles of playing any kind of game with Quest, made me decide Iâ€™d be better off playing something else instead. Overall, itâ€™s probably a better game than the first one, but it ends up with a lesser score because whereas I once felt Quest had potential as a text adventure system, I now suspect it doesnâ€™t; as a result I find myself disliking each subsequent game written with it a bit more than the one before. Maybe it is possible to write a genuinely decent game with Quest, but itâ€™s not something Iâ€™d bet money on and Iâ€™ve pretty much given up any kind of hope of it happening within my lifetime.\r\n\r\nWhile not the unplayable mess that most Quest games are, Kingâ€™s Quest V is far too flawed for me to ever recommend it to anyone and while itâ€™s probably the most accomplished Quest game written to date, by the standards of any other system it would be ranked as poor indeed.

Surely Quest can check a simple command like that, realise itâ€™s the same as GO WELL and process it accordingly? Then there are the usual problems with perfectly ordinary words not being understood, or with commands displaying an error message if not followed by a noun. So TALK on its own will produce the standard Quest error message, yet TALK TO [NPC] will work fine. (The problem here is that if you tried TALK on its own and got an error message, you might well assume the command didnâ€™t work in the game and not try it again.) Oh yes, Questâ€™s parser leaves a lot to be desired and has the potential to turn even a good game into something almost unplayable. Then there are the downright bizarre problems. When standing outside an inn, I attempted to GO TO THE INN and was told I couldnâ€™t go there.<br/><br/>But enough with the flaws of the system. What about the game itself?<br/><br/>Itâ€™s certainly better written than the average Quest game, though suffers from a poor grasp of grammar for the most part. From time to time, the game switches from first person (referring to the player as YOU) to third person (referring to the player as GRAHAM) which is a little jarring to say the least. There doesnâ€™t seem to be any real consistency to this and instead it appears to be down more to simple carelessness than anything else.<br/><br/>Instant deaths abound, never a favourite of mine, and here there are far too many of them. The first game (this is the sequel incidentally) featured this theme as well, and no matter how many times someone can espouse on just why itâ€™s a good idea to have the player killed instantly and without warning, every time it happens to me I find myself wishing they just wouldnâ€™t bother. Why not a simple warning that the player might die? Why not put the player in peril but give them the opportunity to get out in one piece? Why not injure the player or take away score points for mistakes? Killing them every few moves is just a pain.  With Quest lacking the vital UNDO feature, dying means clicking on the restore option in the right hand panel in order to go back to your previous saved game position. (Ah, but what if youâ€™ve decided to play the game with the side panel turned off? Well, then you're up a certain creek without a certain implement because the command entry line becomes disabled when you die, thus putting you in a very sticky position indeed.) With the sheer number of instant deaths on show here, this can become very tiring very quickly. <br/><br/>The game compensates for this to some degree by including a feature that is every bit as annoying here as it was in the first game: namely a message flashing up on screen from time to time warning you to save your game. As with the first game, this seems like a sound idea in theory but when it happens every single time you go a certain way, it quickly becomes a pain. <br/><br/>In style, Kingâ€™s Quest V  is a very retro game. There are no long, flowery descriptions of locations, no details beyond the very basics, the aforementioned instant deaths and, sigh, several timers that donâ€™t really add anything to the game but a fervent wish that the author hadnâ€™t felt the need to include them. Wandering around the desert (a remarkably empty set of locations all virtually identical to each other), I died every four to five moves unless I could find an oasis and drink from it. For some reason, I couldnâ€™t seem to find a way to take any of the water with me (the player apparently lives in a world where glasses, bottles and the like do not exist) so this made exploring the desert an arduous and frustrating task. Iâ€™d find an oasis then walk around it for a bit until I got a message telling me the heat was getting to me, then run back to the oasis, have a drink, and explore a bit further. Sometimes Iâ€™d make it back in one piece. Often I wouldnâ€™t. By the time I had the desert sufficiently explored, I think Iâ€™d died half a dozen times and spent more time than I care to mention wondering just why the author had included such an ultimately annoying puzzle in his game.<br/><br/>Alarmingly few commands seem to be covered and sometimes you need to try something else entirely just to get the game to accept the command you want. For example, I canâ€™t BUY SLED (buy is another word Quest still doesnâ€™t have in its vocabulary), yet talking to the toy shop owner begins a conversation where I try to buy the sled. <br/><br/>I spent quite a bit longer on Kingâ€™s Quest V than I normally do with Quest games, hoping that despite its flaws there was a decent game here, but in the end the sheer number of bugs, the frequent problems with the perspective switching from first to third person, the poor standard of testing and, yes, the usual hassles of playing any kind of game with Quest, made me decide Iâ€™d be better off playing something else instead. Overall, itâ€™s probably a better game than the first one, but it ends up with a lesser score because whereas I once felt Quest had potential as a text adventure system, I now suspect it doesnâ€™t; as a result I find myself disliking each subsequent game written with it a bit more than the one before. Maybe it is possible to write a genuinely decent game with Quest, but itâ€™s not something Iâ€™d bet money on and Iâ€™ve pretty much given up any kind of hope of it happening within my lifetime.<br/><br/>While not the unplayable mess that most Quest games are, Kingâ€™s Quest V is far too flawed for me to ever recommend it to anyone and while itâ€™s probably the most accomplished Quest game written to date, by the standards of any other system it would be ranked as poor indeed.
