Please ask any questions regarding anything in this introduction but keep in mind I wont be able to answer everything :D\r\nI will be posting more updates as the game develops, for now I wish you all a good summer :D\r\n\r\nThe year is 2071.  \r\n \r\nSo much has changed... \r\n \r\nIt is as we have always imagined, from exo-suits to advanced space travel it was like a fantasy come true, one that we have always dreamt about and never failed to achieve. An age where technology has been advancing at a extraordinary pace, with each discovery more significant than the other and humanity has taken great strides in establishing itself as a super power among stars. With the complete colonization of our neighbour Mars marking the dawn of a new era, an era of conquerors, we looked to other planets desperately trying to quench our thirst for expansion and knowledge. Yet even as planet after planet fell into our control, we never forgot our humble beginnings, our home and where our forefathers first established their dominance as a species.  \r\n \r\nEarth.  \r\n \r\nYears of mistreatment have beaten it bloody and although it is but a shadow of its former self, it still has the same awe as the bastion of our achievements. \r\n \r\nTechnology is not our only success in these recent years. For decades humans have fought and slaughtered each other in petty conflicts and grand campaigns, with the idea of peace between us being just another fantasy. Yet, even that was just another barrier we were destined to overcome, with the ideas of equality being present in our most primate years and the longing for a united world not as far fetched as one would believe it. In recent years most of humanity has finally united under one banner through weary years of political and war fatigue, but it only hung by a fragile thread; one government, one set of laws....one problem. As our nature dictates, there were the so called freedom fighters who still rebelled against the idea of a unified world. They call themselves \"The Spark\", seeking to destroy our grand ideologies and remove those from power who have forged our beautiful colonies and the noble laws we so faithfully abide. One can see the irony of these savage rebels, believing a single spark could set ablaze our dreams that we have fought so hard to achieve, not realising that it is they who jeopardise the bright future ahead of us. \"The Spark\" however are a curious bunch, we have sought to rid of them for many years but like roaches they have scattered and proven hard to exterminate, seeking to break our idea of equality, love and prosperity by spreading their filthy lies about our honourable government and radical messages to the masses. \r\n \r\nThey believe that under the silk veil of illusion the \"Unified World\" has presented, hides an ugly truth just waiting to be revealed. All foolish lies. Our leaders reassure us it is all but a lie spread to cause dissent among us, but whether you choose to believe this is a matter of  allegiance and in these times you have to be careful who you side with. \r\n \r\nYou choose whether to believe that freedom is a mere lost concept in these times, siding with \"The Spark\" to fight our \"evil\" government... \r\n \r\n...or you can be the citizen you were born to be, a shining example of our achievement. \r\n \r\nWhatever your choice, you can be sure a grand adventure awaits you....

It is not necessary that you start coding in order to have some progress, but perhaps developing some premises would be a good next step, as so far you did only offer a setting for the story. \r\n\r\nWill the game be centered on government? The rebelion? Will the character start the game as neutral and then be offered a way to choose sides? \r\n\r\nIs the game, actually about explorers' perspective watching the two sides struggle? \r\n\r\nPerhaps the game is about the exo-esqueleton use and the smart way you are planning to deal with this piece of tech during the game. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the game is more about starship and tactical sense or perhaps about planetary management at a given level. \r\n\r\nDesign your premise and how player will interact with the story you have in mind. So far, only having a setting, I feel you don't know what doing. You tailored the rebel alliance, the empire and a few about the tech. But still lacking Luke, Vader and the death star's stolen plans or the capture of princess Leia. ",
