With that I have chose to do a new survival series on my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGSCL0CED0oIG8J1mKyDoMw/videos?view_as=subscriber. Im only starting a new one because old one got corrupt and their alot of new features in quest we can take advantage of. I will be stream lining the survival aspect to work better than the last and will be complete with crafting, weather, hunting, cooking, forging and more. So please join me as we start a brand new series coming this Friday, I plan on releasing new episodes twice a week Monday and Friday as those are my days off. First in series we will be making objects to populate a room and a randomizer for spawning them in room, objects to be created: Tree, Grass, Plantfiber, TreeTrunks, Sticks, Stones and a Pond. With these items in place we will be able to make most of everything we need to craft and survive with. https://trello.com/b/jOKMiehq/survival-series Here is a trello board im using to keep what I will be doing in series (uncomplete) please don't hesitate to ask questions or tell me what else you might want to see other then a survival series.\r\n\r\nHope to see people get involved as its helps make these videos easier\r\nMike",
