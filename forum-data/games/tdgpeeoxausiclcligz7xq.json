If you enjoy my games, which include IFComp winner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/wcxyblcktksx6ljky_pz7w/detectiveland\">Detectiveland,</a> Spring Thing winner <a href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/kch41ti8kkytzjd-ocnk5g/the-xylophoniad\" target=\"_blank\">The Xylophoniad</a>, and textadventures' current top-ranking comedy game <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/szzdpehie0mcaioxoopjma/aunts-and-butlers\">Aunts and Butlers</a>, it'd be amazing if you'd consider making a small monthly donation. <small><small>(Or a large one, for that matter.)</small></small>\r\n\r\nIn return you can receive Infocom-esque \"feelies\" - maps, stories, pieces of music, and various trinkets, delivered online or, if you like, as REAL LIFE OBJECTS in the mail. For example, fans of Detectiveland can receive a professionally printed mock 1929 pulp magazine containing original short stories from the world of New Losago.\r\n\r\nThe games themselves will always be free to play, both here on textadventures and on <a href=\"http://versificator.net\" target=\"_blank\">my site</a>.\r\n\r\nFor more info and a video of me in some silly costumes, see <b><a href=\"http://patreon.com/robinjohnson\">http://patreon.com/robinjohnson</a></b>.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n<i>(Hope it's ok to post this here. If not - mods, please let me know.)</i>\r\nEDIT: oh my goodness I had honestly forgotten that I already posted this in the General forum. Apologies for crassly commercial spam. <small>It'd still be really cool to fund me though</small>",
