You could, under the ask/tell tab, to add &quot;tell robot to kill teacher&quot; (or add that as a command - right click on the room you want to run that command and select add command) and run a script after that which completes the action you want using the method I use (in the code below).\n\nIn the below code, you'll find how I swap items out AND the use of a command to add multiple typing options to 'use grenade on rabbit'.
