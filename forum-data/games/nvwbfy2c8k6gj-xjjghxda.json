Tags include monster girls, vore, soft digestion, and much more! You can see the listing at the bottom of this post. Me and my RP partners hammered these out together, and got the idea to turn the logs into a novelized format so others could read them. At the time of this posting, I am up to my 11th story!\r\n\r\nSo... anyone who is interested, please, come check out my work! The link is right down below.
