And It seems to be an attack happy little bastard now, as it seems he is quite hard to shake off at times.  Is that to off set the damage reduced by the jacket?\n\nThe fire extinguisher for the look at room description still seems to be on the wall after I take it.  In the Cold Storage room examining steak or meat after attaining it still tells me it is hanging from a hook, even if I am standing in a totally different room.  Is it just still attached to a hook or is the wording incorrect for the situation?  Also when I tried to “take all” before I had even examined it, “meat” was not even tried to of been picked up.  I had to use “take meat” on it's own to do it.  That is not a problem to me, except all other items that I am aware of do not have that problem.\n\nIn the closet where you start, it says the floor is covered with dirt and what looks like grease.  However when you “use broom”, it tells you you sweep it clean.  Yet reexamine the floor and it shows the exact message before, the floor is dirty and greasy.  And no other rooms so far that I have found even allow you to examine the floor to begin with.\n\nI believe the lobby, the area with all the exacts talks about blood on the floor or what you think is blood, but you can not examine it.\n\nDown in the basement when you find the tunnel, you can go east while it tells you you can barely squeeze through.  Then you can go east again and up.  However, and this is coming right back through the exact tunnel you just came from, you get the same message of barely able to fit through, but you can not go west any more.  Assuming some how your passage is blocked.  Unless It resealed the tunnel, which that would mean it would have had to been down there, you are not allowed to go back through.  I have yet to make my way back around and down again to check if the tunnel had indeed been resealed or not, but I am assuming it is a game glitch.\n\nYou still can not drink the fluids, only eat them, although when you type &quot;eat&quot; what ever, it says you &quot;drink&quot; what ever.\n\nYou can only read documents by typing it out fully.  I think &quot;doc&quot; or &quot;docs&quot; would be great for short hand.\n\nBesides the jacket which is a visible improvement, what others have you made?",
