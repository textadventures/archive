You jump to each new system in your pathfinder vessel, dealing with issues and encounters as you attempt to build ring gates for the expanding human race.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the game will take you up to the first jump. However, if you go through the tutorial, you can detour into the gym for a little hand-to-hand training.\r\n\r\nLots planned for the game.

      "EditableText": "I would recommend not naming and detailing the ship's captain. Let whoever is playing the game - to be the captain. That will make player connect with the ship, crew and the story way more. Instead I would give bit more background on the first page, for example:\r\n\r\n_It finally happened! Years of service and hard work finally paid off and just a couple of days back you have been promoted to the rank of Captain! Ceremony itself was not too grand, but shortly afterward you have been ordered to report to the Deepspace Military Shipyards for a secret briefing. Excited and ready for anything, you stepped into the shuttle that will take you to the Shipyard in just about five minutes._\r\n\r\nYou could add bit of history about player character's service in the space navy or something, but this way you make it easier to get into the role play. Those are my 2 cents, hope it helps :)",
