If you're looking for suggestions I have a few, most specifically with figuring out what commands to use to accomplish certain tasks.\n\nFor example, when I saw the note on the refrigerator, my first instinct was to type &quot;read note&quot; which didn't work. It's a small detail, and while &quot;examine note&quot; makes sense, including a verb for &quot;read&quot; would help make things less frustrating for people who aren't as familiar with text adventure games.\n\nSimilarly, while I figured I needed to fill the teapot with water from the sink, no combination of using the teapot with the sink would work. I randomly figured it out when I thought maybe I had to turn the sink on first, and magically that caused the teapot to fill. \n\nAlso, one small detail. You might want to remove the default prefix/suffix from the milk object, because the description says, &quot;You can see a milk.&quot; which I'm assuming you didn't do intentionally.\n\nI was impressed by how deftly you handled pouring the tea. I typed in &quot;pour tea&quot; and was prompted to select an item from my inventory, and when I selected teapot, my cup of tea was poured. I thought that was implemented very well!\n\nAnyway, that's about it. A general rule of thumb when designing text adventure games is to try and think of the different ways a player might try to approach an action in your game and try to accommodate it as best as you can. Excellent first game, though!",
