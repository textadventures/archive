So I will work on technical part of game and design and writer or story logic and dialogues, stuff you like:) \r\n\r\nIf interesting send me an massage or find game in Facebook its called: \r\nNight in Fog - Tactical RPG \r\n\r\nScreens are old there lot more have done:) \r\n\r\nIn hope of good cooperation, \r\nDendrobats AKA Oto Rudovics",
