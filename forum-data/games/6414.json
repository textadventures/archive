I've had quite a lot of experience in writing different stories especially sci-fi therefore its going to be a very ambitious project. I am really excited to begin this game, as it is something I have wanted to do for a while now and have never found the time to do so. \n\nI am currently planning for this to be a in-depth and interesting (hopefully) story, one which is a living, breathing universe all in itself and one that will capture your attention and imagination. Currently my planning stage is complete and over the next few days and weeks I will begin my project, hopefully it will not take too long to deliver to the community. All my heart desires is for this game to really appeal to you all. However, that is all optimistic so far and up to you guys. I know I have not revealed much to you about the game itself, but that is part of the magic and mystery <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) -->\n\nAny questions please contact me, if i don't reply through my account here, just send me an email on [u:3d4i3frz]mkosek.blackbird@gmail.com[/u:3d4i3frz].\n\nIll keep you all posted on progress, \nRegards, \nBlackbird <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
