Your writing style is quite natural and easy to read (though there are a few comma problems and &quot;your&quot; as &quot;you&quot; - e.g. &quot;You snap you head back&quot;). But overall, I found myself getting into it. I'm not sure 100% where it's going, though your lead-in and where it left off have some strong hints. I just don't know where you plan to take it from there.\n\nI especially liked how your coffee choice showed up later in the story. More of that, for sure!\n\nLooking forward to seeing more. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
