      "EditableText": "Hello, guys! \r\n\r\nI noticed this forum is full of players (and developers) who love games with compelling storylines. It's not that easy to find such type of players I must admit. I love text adventures so much too so I think your opinion of experienced players will help us to make our project even better. Some guys think that interactive fiction community is dead. We are on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nOur crew (one developer and two writers, one native English speaker/writer will be hired soon) is developing a game right now: <b>Dark Forest: Reborn</b> - nextgen text-based rpg of romance and adventure.\r\nYou can find more information <a href=http://darkforestgame.blogspot.ru>here in our devlog</a>. Follow us and be the first to play Dark Forest: Reborn!\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Key features of Dark Forest: Reborn</b></h3>\r\n\r\n- <b>NPCs that support natural language interactions and relationship modeling using a modern chatbot's AI core. Multiple romance options.</b>\r\n\r\nThis simply means you will interact with cool characters using phrases like ‘Hello!’, ‘How are you?’ ‘I am your friend, trust me!’, ‘Do you prefer human meat or maybe I should bring some fruits?’.\r\n\r\nYou will test your perception, charisma and conversational skills. Based on your words and actions, our characters will decide if you are nice person or not. If not, watchout!\r\n\r\n- <b>Choices and real consequences. The game won’t tell you how to play.</b>\r\n\r\n- <b>Nonlinear and replayable game world that adapts to your personality.</b>\r\n\r\nDo or say an evil thing and the world around you will look (or even become) evil.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.indiedb.com/games/dark-forest-reborn/images/dark-forest-reborn-rpg-change-of-game-world\" title=\"Dark Forest: Reborn game world change - Indie DB\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/54/53617/thumb_620x2000/SQE_game_world.gif\" alt=\"Dark Forest: Reborn game world change\" /></a>\r\n\r\n- <b>Real-time combat system with a bit of gore and awesome finishing moves.</b>\r\n\r\n- <b>Game setting inspired by Arcanum and old fallouts in the style of Andre Norton and Stephen King’s fantasy novels.</b>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Plot</h3></b>\r\n\r\nDistant future. Humanity is doomed. Earth is dying. You are imprisoned in a sealed citadel deep underground. Old machines give you everything you need to live. You spend your time trudging through the citadel and researching its chambers. You have almost accepted your lonely fate, when a tragic accident changes everything.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a group of brilliant Earth scientists were living in this citadel before you, until the day they all mysteriously disappeared. They left behind, however, a monstrous ancient device that gives you a second chance, a way of once again reaching the world outside.\r\n\r\nThe world of Dark Forest: Reborn is full of ancient swamps, poisonous hills and abandoned strongholds of fallen civilizations. During your journey you will face strangers, and change their fates forever. Some of them will curse you. Some of them will be ready to give their lives for you. After your adventure you will be judged, and the fate of every character and the world of Dark Forest: Reborn itself will be revealed.\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Characters</b></h3>\r\n\r\nDark Forest: Reborn mixes classic text adventure game mechanics with mechanics of interactions with NPCs via natural language dialog.\r\n\r\nFor example, in location 'House of Cannibals' you may find daughter of the Cannibals, Qara, 21 y/o slender black-haired girl with tired face who lives with her family in the depths of the forest. Your main task will be to escape the House of Cannibals. Qara's motives are not clear so it's up to you to choose your way of completing the quest: you can try to capture her and force her to help you, you can try to gain her trust or just ignore her and escape the House of Cannibals on your own. Everything depends on your personality, kindness, cruelness or even madness.\r\n\r\nMaybe Qara doesn’t like her family and wants to escape the House of Cannibals too? Or maybe she just wants to eat your entire body alone? She definetly prefers red wine so maybe your fate is just to become a part of her dinner...or maybe this girl will be your best friend.\r\n\r\nTest your perception, charisma and conversational skills and find out the truth!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.indiedb.com/games/dark-forest-reborn/images/dark-forest-reborn-compliments-to-qara\" title=\"Dark Forest: Reborn Compliments to Qara - Indie DB\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/54/53617/thumb_620x2000/SQE_Qara_Compliments1.gif\" alt=\"Dark Forest: Reborn Compliments to Qara\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.indiedb.com/games/dark-forest-reborn/images/dark-forest-reborn-compliments-to-qara-knot\" title=\"Dark Forest: Reborn Compliments to Qara: Knot - Indie DB\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/54/53617/thumb_620x2000/SQE_Qara_Compliments2_bow_fixed.gif\" alt=\"Dark Forest: Reborn Compliments to Qara: Knot\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Combat system</b></h3>\r\nI posted an article about Dark Forest: Reborn combat system <a href=http://www.indiedb.com/games/dark-forest-rebor>on IndieDB</a>.
