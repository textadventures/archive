American TV shows/series and movies are just pathetic now. Japan's anime/manga is so superior to American dodo-bird trash. So much genius and advanced content and theme from Japan, which none of that exists with American bimbo'ism.

Anime has kept advancing, there's so much better stuff out there now to watch. Though, I would like to watch through DB and DB GT (and whatever more DB there is) to complete the anime series that introduced me to anime/manga ... but I don't think it'll ever happen... as there's too much new good anime, always coming out.\r\n\r\nAnd... I'd first watch and complete/catch-up on One Piece (I've only seen a few episodes of it... so that's only ~ \"700\" episodes to watch currently, lol) and I still have to finish up on naruto (shippuuden), which I'm maybe only half way through... long before the 4th great war finale (which I've watched most of them, lol), and I still haven't quite finished bleach either... (I just need to watch the final episodes after aizen is defeated. I tried watching the last arc after aizen, but was bored with it, and so hadn't finished up bleach yet, but I practically have, not too many last episodes after aizen final battle)... so watching through DB and the other DBs... is way way way on the back burner.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nhmm... I watched some of piranha but didn't notice any really good fanservice... but I've not watched the whole thing, so might have missed the better girls... I mean scenes... lol.

I don't understand censorship... there's so much worse stuff that's not taken down... while lesser stuff gets taken down... doesn't make any sense... sighs.
