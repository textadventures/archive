      "EditableText": "Hi guys,\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts about the last if-comp in order to help anyone who would like to participate next year.  Well, i had a bad ranking but i'm glad I wasn't the last one <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->.  I'm still have a chance to grasp a little price because there were too many and the winners can only pick one, lol! yay, the belgian chocolates hasn't been picked up yet... Ok here we go:\n\n1.  First, you have to write a great story.  There a list out there of things to do to win the competition and its more about writing a book than writing a game.  I didn't care about my english because I was more interested in the game, that was a huge mistake.  Nowadays, text adventures is more about making an interactive book. That's way there were so many CYOA.  I guess the players these days are avid readers.  Personally, as I player, I am more interested in playing than reading and that's why I am fan of Scott Adams games.\n\n2. Write something funny.   I think the old days where the games challenges your mind are gone.  Now is about reading a story and laughing about it without really sweating.  That's why judges ask for many hints, walkthrough and &quot;helplful responses&quot;. At least, in the competitions, judges have a two hours limit.  The winner himselp said it, less puzzles more story.\n\n3. About the engine.  I think hyperlinks and panels are very cool for an iphone app but for the competition is better not to use it because the judges are very sneaky about it.  They preferred a more standard game.  And all of the responses has to be customized, they hate automatic responses.  Maybe quest is ahead of its time for these guys <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\n4. Betatesters.  I didn't have the time, so I was the only testing.  But that's a suicide.  I don't think I need to say more.\n\nSo, now i'm gonna try my luck with the spanish competition.  Oh yeah baby! My people need me, lol! Spanish betatesters are welcome!\n\nM4u",

I would agree that some players will be put off just because it is different, but I think if you can make it good, others will be impressed. If the player can look at the compass rose rather than having to have the exits listed in the text at each location should allow a more flowing narrative. I hope to enter next years (and I am starting now!) and while I will not have hyperlinks (which distract from the text IMO) I will keep the panes.\n\nI am thinking about putting a &quot;How to&quot; page on the Wiki with advice like this, by the way.",
