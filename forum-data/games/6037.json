Take these for what they're worth. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nFirst, I want to say that I'm not some sort of grammar Nazi - I know that on the internet, different people have different abilities. If someone is posting in a forum, for example, I don't care if they misspell something or get a period wrong. BUT... this is a *text* adventure game. The text is your medium. Once you generally release it, it will viewed and played by people who are there for the text. I think it's critical that you get that right. \n\nThe way it's formatted right now (and the occasional punctuation or spelling error) makes it harder to read than you would want. The text is your medium!\n\nThe lack of an initial capital letter on sentences could be considered a stylistic thing. I don't know if it's deliberate or not, but it's a bit off-putting (to me). And something like this is just hard to read:\n\n[quote:25lb1u63]&gt; search music box\nyou take it and turn it around.there are innitials engraved on the bottom.it says C.T.maybe the owner of this place?[/quote:25lb1u63]\n\nBeyond the misspelled word, jamming all the text together without proper spacing just makes it a chore for the player to have to deal with - things don't scan well, and you have to actually sit and figure out where things are instead of having it just flow from the page into your brain. It may not be much to work out, but the point is - unless you're deliberately trying to make things difficult - you just don't want that. (Forgive me if I get this wrong, but I sense English is not your native language?) So I would suggest you get people to proofread this. Ok - enough about that.\n\nSecond, I felt I was being led a bit by things, in terms of conclusions to be reached. &quot;it says C.T.maybe the owner of this place?&quot; How do I know there is an owner for where I am? I know nothing.\n\nFor another example, when looking at the colored image, it says:\n\n[quote:25lb1u63]there are some similarities between this image and the upper part of the grey scale scan ... maybe a submarine inspecting somekind of underwater arqueological site ? what is all this ?[/quote:25lb1u63]\n\nTo be honest, that wasn't what I was thinking. I had no idea what it was. It was a bit jarring to have the player character telling me what I'm supposed to be thinking. To have &quot;me&quot; reaching conclusions that I hadn't made just felt wrong.\n\nMore than that, if you look at that text, you can see the second part of this problem: that you're assuming people will be doing things in a specific order. What happens if the player looks at the colored image first? The text for the colored image implies that I've already looked at the grey scale scan. What if I haven't?\n\nTo give an example with a bigger issue, consider that the player doesn't look at anything but simply begins wandering around. They go N, N, E and then E, so that they are now in the second office room. The text for this room says:\n\n[quote:25lb1u63]You are in a second office room.\nlooks like you are the &quot;guest&quot; of some weird people \nthat are fascinated with a big stone \nthat a bunch of ocean explorers found underwater.\nbut why ? why did you come here ?[/quote:25lb1u63]\n\nWithout having looked at the photos, scans, cutouts, etc, this is nonsensical. It's referencing things that the player may not have even done or seen yet. I'm not saying there is an easy solution to this. You're trying to force a linear path of discovery in a medium that is basically free form. One solution is to vary the text based on what has happened. If they view the colored image before the gray scale one, then the text should reflect that fact.\n\nA possibility for the larger issue is to perhaps be a bit heavy handed - force the user (either directly or indirectly by association) to view what you want them to view before they move on. I don't have a nice, neat and tidy way to present this to you. It's a question of design. But you simply cannot assume the player will look at the things you want in the sequence you do, if ever. And if your game relies on them seeing things, then you need to somehow make sure it happens.\n\nThe other solution is to not put text in that reaches conclusions for the player. Let them make their own conclusions.\n\nThe layout is ok. I like the use of images, though they're too large to fit under the map on my system. \n\nGoing further, here's another example:\n\n[quote:25lb1u63]\nalmost no light reaches down here. should you really continue ?\nslowly your eyes adapt to the darkness and you can see a greenish light below.\nyou continue to climb down.\n\nYou can go up or down.[/quote:25lb1u63]\nWhat if I go up now, since I can? Doesn't &quot;you continue to climb down&quot; become a bit premature? <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\n[quote:25lb1u63]You can see a locker 1, a locker 2 and a locker 3.\nYou can go up, west or north.\n\n&gt; look at locker 1\na normal metal locker the door is open and you can see that it is clean and empty.\n\n&gt; look at locker 3\nempty like the other two lockers.[/quote:25lb1u63] \nHopefully you can see how things don't have to go in the order you assume.\n\nWhen looking at the schematic in the conference room, it says below:\n\n[quote:25lb1u63]this people must be totally nuts. this doesnt make any sense at all.[/quote:25lb1u63]\n\nActually, I studied it a bit, and it did make sense to me! Which just further creates that divide between me and the player character and spoils the immersion. You really don't want to tell the player what they should be thinking. Better to let them be confused if they're confused (unless you're really trying to make the player feel they are manipulating a uniquely defined other character, which you haven't done. Your character is just a standard AFGNCAAP. If you really want to force thoughts onto the player, then you need to give your PC more personality, back story, etc, so the player won't be disturbed by the separation. See this: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Everyman\">http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Everyman</a><!-- m -->  and this: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/AFGNCAAP\">http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/AFGNCAAP</a><!-- m -->)\n\nAnother minor thing: the inability to take even commonplace things like photos is a bit jarring as well.\n\nI hope you don't mind me nothing all these little things. I'm only doing it because I can see you have put a lot of effort into this so far, and that you're serious about getting it together and out into the world. If I didn't think you were serious, I wouldn't bother! I hope if any of this seems harsh, that you can understand why and maybe take some of the constructive bits on board.\n\nI'm actually curious to see where this goes. It's off to a good start! It just needs a lot of polish and a lot of play testing to work out all the different paths players may take through it, so you can make it all make sense no matter how perverse the player is.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->   (And it's definitely not &quot;beta&quot;.

Game ideas and writing are my strength, but I seriously lack the coding/scripting knowledge to really churn out game after game.  My first attempts were so brutally obtuse that they are buried somewhere in the forever-eternal depths of my hard drive.  After, no kidding, seven or eight pretty extensive muck-ups, I finally produced something that resembles a pretty good game - 'Xanadu - the World's Only Hope' Part 1.  Even that game is scripted so poorly that I am going back through and fixing some scripts that aren't well done.
