      "EditableText": "Hey!\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a text adventure based on the true story of the Roanoke Colony and some of the theories surrounding it. It may take a while (school commitments permitting) but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas that they would like to see in a game of this description.\r\n\r\nI want it to be more of a mystery game than a horror one, despite its spooky setting. The things I have already added are:\r\n\r\n- a satisfying combat system\r\n- statistics checks\r\n- a 'knowledge' counter that helps you decipher clues\r\n- a fitting soundtrack\r\n- interesting NPCs\r\n\r\nIf you have any other ideas for mechanics or ideas for specific NPCs/encounters, I'd love to hear them!\r\nThe story takes place in North Carolina in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatt",
