      "EditableText": "Hello there! \r\nI used Ren’Py to work on Roadwarden for almost 4 years, and now it’s available on Steam! It’s an illustrated text-based RPG in which you explore and change a hostile, grim realm.\r\n\r\nStore: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1155970/Roadwarden/\r\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv_RkRib63I\r\n\r\nOriginally, I intended to make an adventure game, but as the time went on, things grew more complex. Now it offers a 30+ hours single player campaign, though I expect most players won’t uncover all of its mysteries with a single playthrough. \r\n\r\nIt’s a slow game that rewards patience and curiosity, with many branching quests, endings, and high responsiveness. I’m convinced every playthrough will be a meaningfully different experience.\r\n\r\nI tried to portray a melancholic mystery with a relatable story and cohesive lore. If you have any questions, I’d love to answer them.",
