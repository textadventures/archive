My point being he has helped me (perhaps without knowing it) and I'm sure that there are no ill wishes there.  Just the same, I would do the same for him were I to find that I could.  What's more, I'm sure everyone here would gladly help you with your issue, despite the circumstances.  Good sportsmanship dictates that we must help you, or else we're sabotaging the competition; even though there's a prize now, most of us started for the prize of honor, and I doubt we'll cast that aside so easily.<br/>So, my wordy rant aside, I would suggest that you subtly make a post regarding your problem, and quietly neglect to specify that this problem is for your QuestComp entry (if possible) for the sake of some discretion.  The textadventures website is by far my favorite community that I've found to be a part of, and that's what community is about, right?",

IFComp's only stipulation is that the length of your game is under two hours.  That's a lot of extra criteria to have to meet as compared to other entrants.

Between that and the contract work I have to do from time to time in order to have money means I just couldn't get something put together in time for the competition. It's pretty much the same story of why I had to back out of Spring Thing.",
