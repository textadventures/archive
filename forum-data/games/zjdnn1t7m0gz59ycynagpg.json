Sorry I haven't rated any yet but I will ;) I have come across some Pokémon games on here. I'm not really a fan of the cartoon but I do like the games.  That being said Im working on a CYOA style game. Its HTML based with graphics & sounds. Im working on battles right now, and will have a link for the game play demo. But this is a really big project. Before really getting into it real deep, I would like some feed back from players that would be interested in playing. \r\n\r\nIf there is enough players I will continue the work on the game. I will post the link here soon. Doing some touch ups right now.",
