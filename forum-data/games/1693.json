I figure I need to get him to leave his post and go to the circus, but nothing I try works.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of where I am in the game, I have the following in my inventory: Curved glass disc, Metal bowl, Letter, Metal rod and hoop (with net), Clean cup, Lute, Wild speckled mushrooms, Swede, Poster, Nail, Face mask, Beaker, Hip flask, Rat, Tube (with stop and wick).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",

Most of my IF efforts go towards playing and documenting other people's games, rather than writing my own.\r\n\r\nIt's unlikely I'll author anything in Quest anytime soon, but maybe someday I'll be moved to porting a game or writing something smallish in it. My brief experiences with Quest games several years ago didn't give me a good impression of the system, but this year, since the release of Quest 4, I've tried a few of the newer games, and I've actually enjoyed several of them, particularly the Sir Loin games by CJ here. And the multiplayer possibilities of Quest are... intriguing. And the textadventures.co.uk site itself is quite nice. So, even though I think Quest is a bit more primitive than I'd like, I'm also more positive about Quest than I was formerly, and I can see good things in its future.\r\n\r\nAnd my apologies for the delay in replying. I only returned to the forum hoping to see discussion about Shiversword: The Beginning. Since I could, heh, use a hint.",
