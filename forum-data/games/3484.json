And since the safe was cleaned out, this was the only thing that they decided to leave behind in there. <br/><br/>Also, would you guys suggest that I publish this as a demo? Or should I post this thread in the announcement forums? I'm looking for multiple views before making huge changes. Although - I am curious sonic, if you thing I would solve your concerns about the dialogue by making more of it optional, and less of it required to go through to the next puzzle etc.?<br/><br/>What are your thoughts in that regard?",
