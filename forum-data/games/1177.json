      "EditableText": "[b:168imre7]One Robot[/b:168imre7] by Michael Tritz\n\n\nBlurb: â€œYou are a robot designed to serve humans, but you turn on them with your two friends and prepare to assassinate the president.â€ \n\nNot the most enthralling introduction to a game I've ever read unfortunately. Itâ€™s never really said just why your robot character has decided to assassinate the president. Boredom? Nothing better to do? Or just something the author decided to put but never actually got round to explaining?\n\n[b:168imre7][u:168imre7]Good points[/u:168imre7][/b:168imre7] \n\nThere werenâ€™t a lot of things I could find about [b:168imre7]One Robot[/b:168imre7] that I actually liked. While not one of the worst IF games ever written, it had more than a few flaws. On the positive side of things, there were very, very few spelling mistakes, a rarity in Quest games that deserves a mention all of its own. It was also an easy game to make progress with as it lacked any real puzzles and just required the player to move from one location to another and perform remarkably simple task. If not for the fatal bug at the gameâ€™s end, you could be through the entire thing from start to finish in perhaps twenty minutes.\n\n[b:168imre7][u:168imre7]Bad points[/u:168imre7][/b:168imre7] \n\nThe descriptions: most are way too short and lack any kind of depth. Frequently Iâ€™d see things like \n\nYOU ARE IN BOSS'S OFFICE.\nTHERE IS BOSS HUNTER HERE.\nYOU CAN GO SOUTH.\n\nor\n\nYOU ARE IN DETECTIVE OFFICE.\nTHERE IS RECEPTIONIST HERE.\nYOU CAN GO EAST.\n\nwhich smacks of lazy game writing. Neither the bossâ€™ office nor the detective office might be interesting places, but they need [i:168imre7]something[/i:168imre7] in them. Aside from anything else, saying things like THERE IS BOSS HUNTER HERE makes for a jarring read.\n\nThere was a particularly bad bit later in the game where I found myself in a number of locations called Nibel, none of which had so much as a single description beyond YOU ARE IN NIBEL and the exits listed. The same applied for several dozen locations when I was flying around in a plane called Cheese-Puff 9000 (decent names isnâ€™t one of this gameâ€™s strong points) which are labelled as â€œ0,3â€ â€œ0,4â€ â€œ0,5â€ etc.\n\nThe game also lacks descriptions for some actions performed by the player. I killed an NPC in one location yet wasnâ€™t told he was even dead nor did his dead body show up. In another, I used an energy bazooka to destroy a gate yet instead of some text informing me what had happened, I instead got a blank line. Was this game written in such a hurry that the author didnâ€™t even have time to write something?\n\nItems: items need to be referred to by their full names, and not just a single word. A frequent problem in games by newcomers to the scene, but still a pain. So if I have, say, the Super Switch Presser 2000, I canâ€™t refer to it as Switch or Switch Presser to save on typing, I have to bash out Super Switch Presser 2000 every time.\n\nThe descriptions of the items are poor as well. The Super Switch Presser 2000 is referred to as NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY while the Beam Sword is A LIGHT SWORD THAT DOES SOME DAMAGE. Other item descriptions are every bit as poor.\n\nGuess the verb: another common fault in games by newcomers. At one point in the game I'm required to kill someone (I'm supposedly playing the part of â€˜one of the good guysâ€™ but the game requires me to kill this person in cold blood anyway) yet commands like KILL COMMUTER or ATTACK COMMUTER werenâ€™t recognised. Instead, the strangely worded USE BEAM SWORD ON COMMUTER is needed. Elsewhere there was a switch which could only be activated by USE SUPER SWITCH PRESSER 2000 ON SWITCH instead of the more simple PRESS SWITCH or PUSH SWITCH. Even USE SWITCH would have been better.\n\nI also came across a few oddities, the worst being a trio of thugs (all referred to as â€˜thugâ€™ incidentally) who calmly stood there while I blasted them away with a chain gun. Due to the weaknesses of the game programming, I was only able to kill them one at a time, yet the remaining thugs never made any attempts to stop me massacring them or tried to run away. What nice and obliging thugs.\n\n[b:168imre7][u:168imre7]Lack of Direction[/u:168imre7][/b:168imre7]\n\nIf there's one major flaw with [b:168imre7]One Robot[/b:168imre7], itâ€™s that it lacks any kind of direction for most of the time. You move from place to place, perform simple tasks, and then move somewhere else and perform another task. Most are relatively straightforward and donâ€™t require any kind of figuring out, but seldom is there any kind of motivation behind your actions. You are asked to kill people and steal things without any real purpose being given.\n\n[b:168imre7][u:168imre7]Conclusion[/u:168imre7][/b:168imre7]\n\nNot a terrible game, but certainly well below average, [b:168imre7]One Robot[/b:168imre7] features dozens of empty locations that seem to be there for no other reason than to make the game seem far larger than it really is. There is nothing to do in the majority of them and even the ones with NPCs and items are mostly bland and featureless. If all that wasnâ€™t bad enough, I reached a dead end in a location called Observatory (1F) (and thatâ€™s the entire description for the location if you're interested) with nothing to do and no exits. The game advised me to hit the switches but as Iâ€™d already done that and got nowhere, it looks like Iâ€™d come across a fatal bug.\n\nThere were enough problems in the game to justify it getting a 1 out of 10 but as thatâ€™s a score I generally reserve for totally unplayable messes (which this isnâ€™t) Iâ€™ll be generous and bump it up a notch.\n\n[b:168imre7]2 out of 10[/b:168imre7]",
