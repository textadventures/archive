Anyway, the first couple of chapters are completley done and playable.  The guys at work were wondering what I was making (they are early twenties and have not even heard of IF) so I let them have a crack at the first chapter (never to early to beta test, right).\n\nThey LOVED it.  I had to pry them away from the computer and they have demanded that I bring it back on every shift to let them continue playing as I finish chapters.  The really cool thing is that they only came up with a few commands that could not be implemented (inspect...who types inspect instead of look?) but for the most part my coding to accomadate the five senses has paid off.\n\nIt just made me feel alot better about the last several months I've spent doing this and so I thought I'd share it with you.\n\nGood luck with each of your projects,\n\nDr.Froth",
