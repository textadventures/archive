The problem before was more the game was leading you by the nose through choices and then suddenly... nothing. It just stopped, with the last text still on screen as if erroneously left behind. A simple line of text like the above to indicate that that phase is done and you're now shifting modes to the real game play should make the transition natural and painless.",

So I started again and this time missed out the training but still bought the shield. I managed to roll my dice and take my first move (which ended up injuring me) but then it wouldn't let me roll the dice again saying 'you have already rolled the dice this move'.
