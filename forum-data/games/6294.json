They are:\n\n&quot;Draculaland&quot; - a comic horror adaptation of Dracula, using a point-and-click interface designed to give the feel of a parser game. Came 4th in the Ryan Veeder Exposition for Good Interactive Fiction. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/rpov9cofu0khiip6p_va4g/draculaland\">http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ ... raculaland</a><!-- m -->\n\n&quot;Portcullis&quot; - a retro-styled swords-and-sorcery castle crawl with some semi-autonomous NPCs and multiple paths through the game. A winner of the 2016 New Year's Minicomp. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/wqntzlbay0kttqjoh5l-lg/portcullis\">http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ ... portcullis</a><!-- m -->\n\n&quot;Aunts and Butlers&quot; - a Wodehousean farce in which your goal is to get into your curmudgeonly aunt's will. Came mid-table in the 2006 Ifcomp. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/szzdpehie0mcaioxoopjma/aunts-and-butlers\">http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ ... nd-butlers</a><!-- m -->\n\nI've got a couple more games, one in the present Spring Thing, which I'll move over if this goes well. Nice to find this place.\n\nShare and Enjoy!",
