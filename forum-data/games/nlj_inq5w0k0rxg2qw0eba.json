I did have the enemies health show originally, but I took it out to add more challenge to the game, the suggestion of not exact is really good I'll use that! There is resting outside of battle and it's recommended you rest after every battle. I'm working on a special edition and I'll be sure to include your suggestions, there is a demo on game jolt, I was working on a sequel, but decided to remake the original 1st, I plan on adding a lot more, there is already fighting with NPCs and talking with enemy bosses, there is some ascii art and I want to add in a map, I'm putting in magic and spells and side quests/mini bosses and saving, I really want to add another area and dungeons! This one was also one word input, the standard C++ string input ends the string at the 1st space, but now I'm using C# so I can do so much more! Thanks again everybody!",
