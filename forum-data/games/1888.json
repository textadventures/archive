I haven't tried any of yours so I cannot comment on them.  \nYour games are currently uncategorized because a moderator has not assigned them yet.  They are assigned after the moderator attempts to play the game and decides how playable the game is.  If it is loaded with errors (as most games here are) or they are &quot;demos&quot; or &quot;test games&quot;, they get sent to the sandpit category.\nGood luck!",
