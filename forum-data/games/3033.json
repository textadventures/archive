If anybody wants to volunteer to be a moderator then please let me know. It's a simple task, when you have moderator privileges you get a dropdown on a game page where you can assign the category, and there's a page for uncategorised games so it's pretty quick to go through - I put anything that's clearly been knocked up in the space of a few minutes into &quot;Sandpit&quot;, and everything else generally goes into the category the author suggested when submitting.\n\nSo please drop me an email if you don't mind checking the uncategorised page from time to time! There's also an RSS feed so you can be notified of new uploads in Google Reader etc.",
