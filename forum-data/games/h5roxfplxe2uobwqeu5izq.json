I have tested the game to the best of my ability on my own, and was hoping if there were a few people who might help me turn up anything that I may have overlooked. If you are interested in giving me some <i>constructive</i> criticism about the game mechanics, please leave a brief post about why this appeals to you and I will send you a message with a link to the game. I will post a new thread in this forum when the game is officially released.",
