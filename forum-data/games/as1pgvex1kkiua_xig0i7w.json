      "EditableText": "There are probably way more attributes that you've even noticed on a first play - every dragonet (there are 20) has about 150 attributes, ranging from colour and size to where they fall on the trait scales (eg selfish-altruistic, honest-deceitful), and a LOT of flavour text that gets plugged into the sections after your character Impresses one. The idea was to make each one feel like a complete individual, as well as creating replayability - you can play the game multiple times, Impressing a different dragonet each time, or landing on one of the non-standard game-overs.\r\n\r\nAnd there there are probably 500 or 600 other attributes not related to the dragonets specifically. There's a lot being flagged in any game! The opening section, which you'll have seen sets up your character, has a lot of Squiffy ifelse statements, so if you select one origin the next section offers you the two possible backgrounds for that origin.\r\n\r\nGetting the sidebar working, reflecting what's going on in the main panel, was almost entirely mrangel's work. You can speedrun straight through the game without doing most of the quests, but you're not likely to have a very good ending if you do - logging available and closed quests helps players remember what they have to do.\r\n\r\nAs for balance, that was tough because most people want to play a 'nice' character! So finding ways to offer options that are Selfish or Reserved or Blunt was a challenge. All the dragonets have preferences when it comes to character traits, and each one has a Primary Trait that your character has to match for the dragon to even consider him - if you don't have the Vindictive trait, then the dragonet whose primary trait is Vindictive won't even consider you. We've had about 500 playthroughs posted to our leaderboard, and three of the twenty dragonets haven't been Impressed yet, because they have less common personalities.\r\n\r\nWe also have a very, very well hidden secret that no one's found yet. I don't think that will go until someone takes a really experimental, unintuitive approach to the game. (Someone with Squiffy knowledge could probably cheat and root it out of the Squiffy code, but we've put in a couple of anti-cheating measures to try to avoid that!)",
