I think there may even be a bug--in one of quite a few rooms I haven't fully figured out yet there is a bird where if I use the &quot;look&quot; command I find out it has a scroll in its beak, but it doesn't show up on the object list and no matter what I do, and no matter how I try to interact with the bird, nothing happens.  I could say more, but really my biggest problem is I have so many possible problems to solve I can't even figure out what comes next!  If I listed them all here I feel it would spoiler the game too much, so if anyone can help me out based on just what I've put here or via PM I'd appreciate it very much.",
