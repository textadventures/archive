(That's fast!).\r\n\r\nOr Le Grand Guignol, for games that are created in more than 3 hours. (Maybe you spent more than those hours, or just wanna create a big masterpiece).\r\n\r\nAlso this year the competition welcomes games done in Spanish. It is host at itch.io, so there's a total of 4 jam pages to allocate the whole affair. Use the map to get your bearings.\r\n\r\nYou can start here:\r\n\r\nhttps://itch.io/jam/ectocomp17lpm\r\n\r\nWho's in?\r\n\r\nKind Regards.\r\n\r\nRuber Eaglenest.",
