      "EditableText": "Hello All!\n\nI'm new to the forums here, and to some extent to Quest as well. It's not ready for release yet, but since it's getting closer to completion I thought I would take this opportunity to announce my upcoming murder/mystery whodunit game, Sleuth. The game is based on the 1983 DOS game Sleuth by Eric N. Miller, and plays similarly to clue. At the start of the game, a murder has been committed and you are the investigator sent to the mansion to interview the suspects and deduce who killed the victim, in what room and with what weapon. Once you think you've got it figured out, bring the murder weapon to the room in which you believe the crime was committed, GATHER the suspects and ACCUSE the murderer.\n\nIf it sounds simple, it's not. Before you can find the murder weapon, you need to locate your magnifying glass which is hidden somewhere in the house, and the suspects aren't always co-operative in answering your questions. To top it all off, if you take too long the murderer will become suspicious and begin stalking you, eventually killing you if you fail to solve the murder in time. \n\nThe game currently features a lot of randomization for replayability, including 2 different mansion layouts. If it's possible, I'd like to have the game in a finished state by the beginning of March, but my absolute latest goal is the end of March. I'll be keeping this thread updated as a sort of devlog for anyone who's interested.\n\nI'm also curious to know what kind of interest there is in a game of this nature, so please feel free to comment/ask questions/make suggestions/etc. <!-- s:-) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:-) -->",
