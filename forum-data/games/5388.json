      "EditableText": "It is not finished...\n\nI'll put this here for your reviewing pleasure.\n\nGeneral criticisms/comments:\n1.  Make sure a game is fully finished (or at least close) before beta-testing.  Or, at least give the tester some clue as to what they should experience when testing.  I thought this game might have been close to done but I think it has miles to go.\n2.  Glad to see you had few items mentioned in rooms without a 'look at' description.\n3.  Work on dialogue with NPCs.  There was nothing to gain other than 'hey, I just said something to that NPC' when talking to any NPC - add a lot of stuff in the ask/tell boxes for those NPCs.  It'll make the game more real.  Also, I would not use the 'play type dialogue' (can't remember what it is called) - example:  \nGnara: You say hello.\nSyx:  Hello Gnara.\nGnara:  How are you today? etc.\nSimply use a script in response to 'talk to player'.  Randomizing responses are a great (albeit slightly more advanced coding option) when 'talking to player'.  That way the player can hear different things the NPC has to say.  And then!!! that player can ask or tell the NPC about something the NPC said.  Makes for great conversation.  Ask on the Forum if you are unsure how to do this.\n4.  Grammar, grammar, grammar, grammar check!  There were far too many grammatical errors in here for a player to 'get lost' in the story.  I've posted some of those errors I noticed below.\n5.  There is a good sense of exploration, which is good.\n6.  Be careful with the map grid.  There were at least two places where two rooms overlapped one another.  If I were you, I might consider getting rid of the map grid all together.\n7.  As far as I can tell, you had about 20-ish rooms but only one object that could be picked up (the root) but nothing could be done with it (as far as I can tell.\n8.  So far, and I assume it is not finished - I saw no signs or hints about the location of ANY of the magic stones, nor did I run into any puzzles.  I assume the root had to go in water somewhere... but I tried to use it on the pool/put it in the pool and I got the standard built-in Quest response when a logical and thoughtful response could easily be provided on your end.\n\nGrammar (and pardon me if this is not easy to understand) - for grammar I used capital letters to indicated word changes or misspellings:\nOpening page:\nfairiEs, startS\n\nTreehouse:\nyouR home...\nplanterS\nflowerS\nX planter = together (misspelled)\n\nSchool:\nsChool\nx renna = wearS\ntalk to renna = riddled with grammar errors, proofread\n\nBrewery:\nx barrel = filled with...\n\nDance room:\noverlaps on map\nyour sister, Brandy (comma)\n\nWorkshop:\nx Dolly = superviseS not supervised\ntalk to dolly = builderS, always (misspelled), 'such' not so, you ARE so kind...\n\nshoes shop:\nx shoes = I can't see that?!?
