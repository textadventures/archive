The above should be enough to prevent player from interacting with the inventory without even having to change POV.\n\n[b:t61rm1ww]Storytelling with low interaction:[/b:t61rm1ww]\n[i:t61rm1ww]You fall asleep and dream how you have became a mouse.

Mouse object has lower health which can be restored only by eating cheese, not apples or bread. They have no attacks so they must &quot;sneak&quot; past enemies. They cannot &quot;speak to&quot; anyone and they can't carry objects.

How do you [i:acco5rb9]know[/i:acco5rb9] that switching the pov does not carry over &quot;needed player object functionality?&quot; Did you read through the code for Quest's engine to see how pov switching works in detail?

So, because we reacted to what YOU typed (incorrectly, according to you), because a site mod (on a forum designed to help people) is trying to make sure new users are not being given misinformation, YOU'RE response is to make it personal and belittle us? Let me tell you something, I can openly admit that you seem to know a lot more about programming in general than I do, and you have a much more aggressive personality than I do, and you're very good at quickly researching information, and I don't feel the least bit &quot;threatened&quot; by you.

There were too many layers of quote there for the forum to handle them all.)\n\nI'm sorry if my answer was unclear. My answer was in the form of quoting the wiki article, where the [i:acco5rb9]full paragraph[/i:acco5rb9] that [i:acco5rb9]you quoted[/i:acco5rb9] the first half of says,\n\n[quote=&quot;[url=http&#58;//quest5&#46;net/wiki/Changing_the_player_object:acco5rb9]Changing the player object[/url:acco5rb9]&quot;:acco5rb9]Each player object gets its own inventory and attributes. This includes status attributes, so each player could have their own health or stats, and these will be updated on-screen as the player switches between characters. For status attributes which apply across the entire game (perhaps &quot;score&quot; for example), you should set these on the &quot;game&quot; object itself, so they will apply all the time regardless of which object is the current POV. [/quote:acco5rb9]\n\nSo, the reason that what you said—\n[quote=&quot;levicki&quot;:acco5rb9]... That is ok if a dream is just part of storytelling without interaction. Otherwise you would have to replicate needed player object functionality on another object. ... are you really saying that people never put scripts, variables, verbs, and status attributes in player object? [/quote:acco5rb9]\n—is not true, is that you do not have to replicate needed functionality, do to the fact that, as the wiki suggests, any vital custom attributes one might want to add could be placed on the game object rather than the player object and would remain available after switching POV.\n\n[quote=&quot;levicki&quot;:acco5rb9]And I clearly stated &quot;if a dream is [b:acco5rb9]just part of storytelling without interaction[/b:acco5rb9]&quot;. If it was not obvious what I meant by that, you could have asked for clarification just like I asked you above. Instead, you did not bother to answer, but continued analyzing what I said and finding stuff to argue about.[/quote:acco5rb9]\n\nI had no inclination that I might be misunderstanding you. It seemed like a very clear, straightforward statement. So, I had no [i:acco5rb9]reason[/i:acco5rb9] to ask for clarification. It is not anyone else's responsibility to double check what the author of a post meant, especially if nothing looks unclear. In the pure text world of the net, without vocal tones or body language, it is one's own responsibility to ensure that the way they've stated things clearly communicates their point. If and when someone clearly [i:acco5rb9]has[/i:acco5rb9] misunderstood something, all that can be done restate the point in another way to try and help them understand. Personally, if someone reacts strongly to my statements, but I can see that they've obviously mistaken my meaning, I re-explain my point and ignore their negative response, because it was a response to a misunderstanding. I couldn’t say how most people deal with that, though.\n\n[quote=&quot;levicki&quot;:acco5rb9]So this time I will give an example.\n\n[b:acco5rb9]Storytelling [u:acco5rb9]without[/u:acco5rb9] interaction:[/b:acco5rb9]\n[i:acco5rb9]You fall asleep and dream about your homeland. You remember your mother and how she used to tell you than &quot;not all that glitters is gold&quot;. You also dream about your castle dungeons and some monsters and your dream drifts into a nightmare from which you wake up screaming and covered in sweat but you do remember your mother's words, and you cannot but wonder about their importance in your current situation.[/i:acco5rb9]\n[u:acco5rb9]Press any key to continue[/u:acco5rb9]\n\nThe above is what I would consider &quot;storytelling without interaction&quot;. If that is all you want to do, then you could add:\n[code:acco5rb9]\n      request (Hide, &quot;Command&quot;)\n      request (Hide, &quot;Panes&quot;)\n[/code:acco5rb9]\nto your script at the beginning of the dream sequence and:\n[code:acco5rb9]\n      request (Show, &quot;Command&quot;)\n      request (Show, &quot;Panes&quot;)\n[/code:acco5rb9]\nafter the key is pressed. The above should be enough to prevent player from interacting with the inventory without even having to change POV.[/quote:acco5rb9]\n\nOkay, that is exactly what I thought you meant when you said,\n\n[quote=&quot;levicki&quot;:acco5rb9]... That is ok if a dream is just part of storytelling without interaction …[/quote:acco5rb9]\n\nSo, you clearly meant NO INTERACTION at all. Now, you’re even going so far as to suggest that the command line and panes may as well be removed, because the player won’t be able to use them properly. That is patently false. I can prove that it is false, with the following game, where the player object is switched with nothing being copied or recreated whatsoever. The object “playerb”  is a raw object I have done nothing to except to set the option for “Can be a player.”\n[attachment=0:acco5rb9]<!-- ia0 -->DemonSlaying.aslx<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:acco5rb9]\n\n[quote=&quot;levicki&quot;:acco5rb9] [b:acco5rb9]Storytelling with high interaction:[/b:acco5rb9]\n[i:acco5rb9]Suddenly, your whole party is surrounded by noxious fumes and you all collapse to the ground and fall asleep. When you wake up, you are tied to the post naked and all your things are gone and your friends are nowhere to be seen. You first need to find a way to free yourself and find your equipment if you want to get to the bottom of this.[/i:acco5rb9]\n\nThe above RPG-ish example is what I meant when I said that you need to replicate some functionality. If you empty the inventory by changing POV, how do you make new character to have the same capabilities, status attributes, commands, verbs, etc?[/quote:acco5rb9]\nAll of the basic [b:acco5rb9][i:acco5rb9]NEEDED[/i:acco5rb9][/b:acco5rb9] functionality remains in place without having to do anything, and as the wiki says, any custom attributes (including verbs, commands, scripts, etc.) could be placed on the game object instead of the player object so that they remain available regardless of POV.\n\n[quote=&quot;levicki&quot;:acco5rb9]If you didn't plan this from the beginning and created a new object type, then make both the player and dream object inherit from that type and implemented all required player functionality in the type itself so that both objects can use it, you will face problems which if you are beginner you most likely won't know how to solve. [/quote:acco5rb9]\nThere would be no need to create a new type to be shared by the two objects, and even if there was a long list of custom attributes on the player object itself, it would not be as complicated to resolve as you are making it sound. All one would have to do is copy the player object and paste it in somewhere else, there’s even new functionality to improve object replication in 5.4 beta, so that Quest automatically makes the new object’s alias be the original object’s name, and the new object's name “[i:acco5rb9]object[/i:acco5rb9]1” or “[i:acco5rb9]object2[/i:acco5rb9]” as needed. As a copy of the player object, the new object would have any and all custom attributes that had been implemented.\n[quote=&quot;levicki&quot;:acco5rb9] [quote=&quot;TriangleGames&quot;:acco5rb9]We can only respond to what's on the screen.\n...\nNo one is asking you to leave, just to be careful with how you phrase things, so new people coming in won't end up getting confused.[/quote:acco5rb9]\n\nYou can also ask me to clarify or if you really feel like arguing you can confront me, hopefully with less vitriol and more arguments.[/quote:acco5rb9]\nWhen you said,\n[quote=&quot;levicki&quot;:acco5rb9]If you feel threatened by my presence here in any way and would prefer me to stop posting just say so and I will leave.[/quote:acco5rb9]\nI immediately felt that you were insulting our intelligence and/or trying to intimidate/bully us, because in the 31 years I have been alive, I’ve heard people say things like, “if I make you feel threatened,” or “oh, am I making you feel threatened?” many times, to myself as well others around me, and the ONLY implication it has ever had, in my personal experience, is to insult and intimidate. So, if that’s [i:acco5rb9]not[/i:acco5rb9] what you were trying to do, let me tell you, when you say “if you feel threatened by me” to someone, they will mostly likely take [i:acco5rb9]that[/i:acco5rb9] statement as a threat in itself, and it is extremely vitriol. Also, at that point in the discussion, the only thing remotely insulting that anyone had said to was, “You are wrong. Please don’t tell people that, because you are going to confuse them.” Well, you were wrong, and sgreig even said “please.” So, apparently, being told you were wrong was so offensive to you that you felt the need to make it personal and try to demean us.\n\nAs for my own &quot;vitriol&quot; comments,\n[quote=&quot;TriangleGames&quot;:acco5rb9] I feel like you're very helpful, as well as overbearing, presumptuous, and condescending. I am usually very complaisant on the web. I DO NOT like arguing with people, but I will not be bullied, even by someone who has helped me.\nNo one is asking you to leave, just to be careful with how you phrase things, so new people coming in won't end up getting confused.[/quote:acco5rb9]\nAs I said at the beginning of this post, I would not waste my time and energy, or risk getting into (what is for me) a very stressful argument just to insult someone. When I said, “I [i:acco5rb9]feel[/i:acco5rb9] like you’re…” all those things, my goal was not to start a flame war with you. I’ve never been in one, and I have [b:acco5rb9]NO[/b:acco5rb9] desire to ever do so. I’m still not convinced that you really are like that in general, but you sometimes [i:acco5rb9]sound[/i:acco5rb9] that way. My hope was that you would take another look at the way you phrase things and consider being a little more careful not to give people the wrong impression of yourself. There have been a few comments you’ve made on the boards that [i:acco5rb9]sounded[/i:acco5rb9] that way. I’m not going to reference all of them here in public, because I don’t want you to feel like I am attacking you. I will just suggest  that you review everything that has happened in [i:acco5rb9]this[/i:acco5rb9] topic, and see if you can understand why some of your statements might [i]sound that way.",

Otherwise you would have to replicate needed player object functionality on another object. ... are you really saying that people never put scripts, variables, verbs, and status attributes in player object? </blockquote><br/>—is not true, is that you do not have to replicate needed functionality, do to the fact that, as the wiki suggests, any vital custom attributes one might want to add could be placed on the game object rather than the player object and would remain available after switching POV.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>levicki wrote:</cite>And I clearly stated &quot;if a dream is <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">just part of storytelling without interaction</span>&quot;. If it was not obvious what I meant by that, you could have asked for clarification just like I asked you above. Instead, you did not bother to answer, but continued analyzing what I said and finding stuff to argue about.</blockquote><br/><br/>I had no inclination that I might be misunderstanding you. It seemed like a very clear, straightforward statement. So, I had no <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">reason</span> to ask for clarification. It is not anyone else's responsibility to double check what the author of a post meant, especially if nothing looks unclear. In the pure text world of the net, without vocal tones or body language, it is one's own responsibility to ensure that the way they've stated things clearly communicates their point. If and when someone clearly <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">has</span> misunderstood something, all that can be done restate the point in another way to try and help them understand. Personally, if someone reacts strongly to my statements, but I can see that they've obviously mistaken my meaning, I re-explain my point and ignore their negative response, because it was a response to a misunderstanding. I couldn’t say how most people deal with that, though.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>levicki wrote:</cite>So this time I will give an example.<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Storytelling <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">without</span> interaction:</span><br/><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">You fall asleep and dream about your homeland. You remember your mother and how she used to tell you than &quot;not all that glitters is gold&quot;. You also dream about your castle dungeons and some monsters and your dream drifts into a nightmare from which you wake up screaming and covered in sweat but you do remember your mother's words, and you cannot but wonder about their importance in your current situation.</span><br/><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Press any key to continue</span><br/><br/>The above is what I would consider &quot;storytelling without interaction&quot;. If that is all you want to do, then you could add:<br/><pre><code><br/>      request (Hide, &quot;Command&quot;)<br/>      request (Hide, &quot;Panes&quot;)<br/></code></pre><br/>to your script at the beginning of the dream sequence and:<br/><pre><code><br/>      request (Show, &quot;Command&quot;)<br/>      request (Show, &quot;Panes&quot;)<br/></code></pre><br/>after the key is pressed. The above should be enough to prevent player from interacting with the inventory without even having to change POV.</blockquote><br/><br/>Okay, that is exactly what I thought you meant when you said,<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>levicki wrote:</cite>... That is ok if a dream is just part of storytelling without interaction …</blockquote><br/><br/>So, you clearly meant NO INTERACTION at all. Now, you’re even going so far as to suggest that the command line and panes may as well be removed, because the player won’t be able to use them properly. That is patently false. I can prove that it is false, with the following game, where the player object is switched with nothing being copied or recreated whatsoever. The object “playerb”  is a raw object I have done nothing to except to set the option for “Can be a player.”<br/><div><a href=\"/attachment/542\">DemonSlaying.aslx</a></div><br/><br/><blockquote><cite>levicki wrote:</cite> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Storytelling with high interaction:</span><br/><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Suddenly, your whole party is surrounded by noxious fumes and you all collapse to the ground and fall asleep. When you wake up, you are tied to the post naked and all your things are gone and your friends are nowhere to be seen. You first need to find a way to free yourself and find your equipment if you want to get to the bottom of this.</span><br/><br/>The above RPG-ish example is what I meant when I said that you need to replicate some functionality. If you empty the inventory by changing POV, how do you make new character to have the same capabilities, status attributes, commands, verbs, etc?</blockquote><br/>All of the basic <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">NEEDED</span></span> functionality remains in place without having to do anything, and as the wiki says, any custom attributes (including verbs, commands, scripts, etc.) could be placed on the game object instead of the player object so that they remain available regardless of POV.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>levicki wrote:</cite>If you didn't plan this from the beginning and created a new object type, then make both the player and dream object inherit from that type and implemented all required player functionality in the type itself so that both objects can use it, you will face problems which if you are beginner you most likely won't know how to solve. </blockquote><br/>There would be no need to create a new type to be shared by the two objects, and even if there was a long list of custom attributes on the player object itself, it would not be as complicated to resolve as you are making it sound. All one would have to do is copy the player object and paste it in somewhere else, there’s even new functionality to improve object replication in 5.4 beta, so that Quest automatically makes the new object’s alias be the original object’s name, and the new object's name “<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">object</span>1” or “<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">object2</span>” as needed. As a copy of the player object, the new object would have any and all custom attributes that had been implemented.<br/><blockquote><cite>levicki wrote:</cite> <blockquote><p><b>&quot;TriangleGames&quot;</b></p><p>We can only respond to what's on the screen.<br/>...<br/>No one is asking you to leave, just to be careful with how you phrase things, so new people coming in won't end up getting confused.</blockquote><br/><br/>You can also ask me to clarify or if you really feel like arguing you can confront me, hopefully with less vitriol and more arguments.</p></blockquote><br/>When you said,<br/><blockquote><cite>levicki wrote:</cite>If you feel threatened by my presence here in any way and would prefer me to stop posting just say so and I will leave.</blockquote><br/>I immediately felt that you were insulting our intelligence and/or trying to intimidate/bully us, because in the 31 years I have been alive, I’ve heard people say things like, “if I make you feel threatened,” or “oh, am I making you feel threatened?” many times, to myself as well others around me, and the ONLY implication it has ever had, in my personal experience, is to insult and intimidate. So, if that’s <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">not</span> what you were trying to do, let me tell you, when you say “if you feel threatened by me” to someone, they will mostly likely take <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">that</span> statement as a threat in itself, and it is extremely vitriol. Also, at that point in the discussion, the only thing remotely insulting that anyone had said to was, “You are wrong. Please don’t tell people that, because you are going to confuse them.” Well, you were wrong, and sgreig even said “please.” So, apparently, being told you were wrong was so offensive to you that you felt the need to make it personal and try to demean us.<br/><br/>As for my own &quot;vitriol&quot; comments,<br/><blockquote><cite>TriangleGames wrote:</cite> I feel like you're very helpful, as well as overbearing, presumptuous, and condescending. I am usually very complaisant on the web. I DO NOT like arguing with people, but I will not be bullied, even by someone who has helped me.<br/>No one is asking you to leave, just to be careful with how you phrase things, so new people coming in won't end up getting confused.</blockquote><br/>As I said at the beginning of this post, I would not waste my time and energy, or risk getting into (what is for me) a very stressful argument just to insult someone. When I said, “I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">feel</span> like you’re…” all those things, my goal was not to start a flame war with you. I’ve never been in one, and I have <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">NO</span> desire to ever do so. I’m still not convinced that you really are like that in general, but you sometimes <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">sound</span> that way. My hope was that you would take another look at the way you phrase things and consider being a little more careful not to give people the wrong impression of yourself. There have been a few comments you’ve made on the boards that <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">sounded</span> that way. I’m not going to reference all of them here in public, because I don’t want you to feel like I am attacking you. I will just suggest  that you review everything that has happened in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">this</span> topic, and see if you can understand why some of your statements might [i]sound that way.",
