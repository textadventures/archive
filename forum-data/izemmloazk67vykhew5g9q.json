I understand they are used primarily for two different things... But what if I want a bit of a Hybrid system?\r\n\r\nIs there a way, for example, to add the Map system of Adventure mode into GameBook mode? Or is there a way to make Adventure mode look visually a bit more like GameBook? I want to have the features of Adventure mode with an easy to read full-page view like GameBook offers.\r\n\r\nCan any of you more experienced authors/creators point me in the right direction?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCypher\r\n\r\n",
