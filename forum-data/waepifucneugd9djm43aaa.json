      "EditableText": "There's several ways to do this. One way would be to use the {command} function.\r\n\r\nSo, say, you create a command called Fight and another called Run. To trigger Fight, you type in Fight and for Run you type in Run.\r\n\r\nThen the code is in a Print, or text: \r\n\r\n    {command:Fight:The actual text the player clicks on}\r\nMake sure Fight and Run have some special code that keeps the player from calling them whenever they type in Fight. Maybe something like\r\n\r\n    if Player.FightOrFlight=True\r\n\r\nThe other way is to use Menu. Create a new variable. I'll call it menulist. Set it to a stringlist. Then add whatever options you want to that list and make sure they're text, not expressions. Then, once you have every option, show a menu that draws from menulist. I recommend not allowing the player to ignore it, but do what your game needs:\r\n\r\n```menulist = NewStringList()\r\nlist add (menulist, \"Option One\")\r\nlist add (menulist, \"Option Two\")\r\nShowMenu (\"The text the player sees\", menulist, false) {\r\n  if (result = \"Option One\") {\r\n  Code for if Option One is picked.\r\n  }\r\n  else if (result = \"Option Two\") {\r\n   Code for if Option Two is picked.\r\n  }\r\n}```",
