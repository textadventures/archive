I always tell people who like to read or ever wanted to make a video game to try Quest.  I decided to try the newest version, but it says the publisher is unknown.  Did it expire or something?  Why has that not been updated?  Some people may not download if it is not up to date and could hurt or lose potential fans/creators/players, etc.",
