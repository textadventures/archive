Lets say I have a set of questions to ask another object, eg. just like when giving the object &quot;Angi&quot; a ask/tell and then typing in &quot;ask Angi about gun&quot; then she should reply &quot;I don't own a gun&quot;, that I get... its fine.\n\nbut now I have come across an idea that could work better, if its possible: using a &quot;show menu&quot; with &quot;if&quot; statements. I create a stringlist in 'game' Game Object which eg. contains strings &quot;gun&quot; and &quot;knife&quot;.\nSo lets say I name the stringlist just &quot;list&quot;, then use &quot;show menu&quot; with text &quot;what would you like to ask?&quot;, then the &quot;list/dictionary&quot; will be &quot;game.list&quot; numbered. How do I make it so that I can input 1 (&quot;gun&quot;) or 2 (&quot;knife&quot;) and make Angi respond with a message? \n\neg. get input-&gt;if input =1-&gt;print message &quot;I don't own a gun&quot;\n     Get input-&gt;if input=2-&gt;print message &quot;the knife is in the kitchen&quot;\n\nAny help please.",
