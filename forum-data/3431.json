I just get an 'undefined' error each time I try this.\n\nHaving failed to implement the table I then tried doing it with javascript alert.  Same problem.  I just can't seem to reference objects from in external files.  The alert works so long as I only put a text string, but that is not what I require.  Any ideas?\n\nSarah",
