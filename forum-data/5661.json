The problem is just as I and you said, with a &quot;getinput&quot;, i can't use a variable assignation. If i write <br/><pre><code><br/>&lt;start&gt;<br/>var = tryme()<br/>&lt;/start&gt;<br/>&lt;function name=&quot;tryme&quot;  type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;<br/>get input {<br/>      if (result = &quot;no&quot;) {<br/>      return false<br/>}<br/>}<br/>&lt;/function&gt;<br/></code></pre><br/>there's no way he will store that false in that var</blockquote><br/>The problem is that the code continues to run, even while waiting for the player to type. If your function is this, you will see what I mean.<br/><pre><code>&lt;function name=&quot;tryme&quot;  type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;<br/>  get input {<br/>    if (result = &quot;no&quot;) {<br/>      msg(&quot;Reply given&quot;)<br/>      return false<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>  msg(&quot;At end of function&quot;)<br/>&lt;/function&gt;<br/></code></pre><br/>The player will see something like this:<br/><br/>Are you happy?<br/>At end of function<br/>YES<br/>Reply given<br/><br/>The bit inside the get input block waits, but not the rest. So the function ends, but no return value has been provided, and then when the player does type in a reply, you have a return for a function that has already terminated.<br/><br/>Take a look at the posts HK found in his last post, and see if all that makes sense.",

It sets the mode and then returns to you. Once the input has been entered, the script you pass it will be called. You are sort of setting up an event handler to capture the next line of input. \n\nI hope that makes some sense. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
