      "EditableText": "Recently I've run into a number of examples of containers that also have surface objects and have struggled to find a good way to represent them in Quest. An example would be a torch with batteries inside and a switch on the outside; another would be a fridge with magnets stuck to the outside and food inside. In Quest, an object can be a container OR a surface but not both at the same time. Is there a neat solution out there?",

Maybe give an object a flag to indicate if it's in or on its parent; or give a container an attribute referring to a scenery container inside it that could be used to separate the in/on objects.",
