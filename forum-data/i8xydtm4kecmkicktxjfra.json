Controls are pretty straight forward, type shit that you want to do and hope that it works. I would advise reading EVERYTHING and looking at every object you can (you can also try using other senses).\r\n\r\nI am really trying to get feedback about what you enjoyed doing, what you tried but failed to do, what disappointed you, what you would improve, etc. Anyone can play, but if you get offended easily then this game will likely piss you off. Other than that, enjoy guys!\r\n\r\nLINK\r\n\r\nhttp://play2.textadventures.co.uk/Play.aspx?id=mhhtavvgq0uf7lmcmwmw6w",
