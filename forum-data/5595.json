After wearing the outfit, it is necessary to be able to carry an object.  Is there a way that I can increase the maximum number of items to two while this character is wearing the outfit.  The worn outfit counts as one object and I need to be able to carry two.  \n\nI've partially solved this by giving the special character the chance at finding a tool belt that can carry a couple items, but I still need the worn outfit to not count as an item (or find some other work around).  Any ideas?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nXanMag",
