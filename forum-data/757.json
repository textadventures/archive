Quest might potentially have more power but the learning curve is steeper, too, and that on its own is liable to dissuade people from using it.<br/><br/>I've written plenty of games with Adrift but every time I start writing one with Quest, I quickly realise that whatever game I'm writing, I could get it done quicker and easier with Adrift. So I quit writing the Quest version and start writing the Adrift one instead. On top of anything else, the interface you play Quest games in needs a major reworking before anyone is going to take it seriously.<br/><br/>Just my two cents and probably unlikely to change anything.</blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Easier does not mean better, i know this because i've tried easier before, Sure i make a game but then it's like every other Adrift game.<br/><br/>and yes there are other FREE Systems out there, the only worthy FREE Multiplayer one how ever is beyond, and it's MUCH more complicated then Quest, beyond is free to download\"and is graphical\" but you need to know a Java/C like language.<br/><br/>Most other Multiplayer ones are pay and are not free, Besides...it's not about Competing...it's about work....Alex spent time coding Quest together...if it were me i'd charge to.",
