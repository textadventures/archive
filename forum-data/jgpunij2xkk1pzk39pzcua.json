I'm looking for any feedback that people are willing to give me, good or bad; both helps in their own way. \r\n\r\nIf interested here is a link to the game = http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/rvnjlvi4heq6u7-namkaxa/the-cataclysm-of-chaos-v5\r\n\r\nEDIT: Uploaded Hotfix 1. Fixes numerous bugs and modifies the loot system. Details on the game page!\r\n\r\nEDIT2: I'm still working on V6 Release. Implemented negative traits and working on adding a few more Journal entries at the moment. Just mentioning it as previously I've been able to release a new update once every week or so, but this Release, #6, has been significantly harder to do than the previous updates, which has slowed me down considerably. Just mentioning it because I've not given up on the game, just been delayed. I'm keeping at it!\r\n\r\nEDIT3: If all goes well, I'll be releasing V6 later today (its 1am Oct 14, so sometime on Oct 14).",
