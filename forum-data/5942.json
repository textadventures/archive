I don't really know any code, but I've used flags, counters, etc to make the story into as much of a &quot;game&quot; as possible, with a primitive inventory system, a couple simple puzzles, stuff like that. Anyway, now I'd like to up the game's visual flair. Are there any common yet effective tips or techniques you guys employ? Is there any way to change a page's background to a specific image? At present I have nothing but white text on a black background. Would you recommend frequent sound effects?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. This is my first experience using Quest, and it's been a lot of fun.\n\nThanks!",
