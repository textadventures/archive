      "EditableText": "If you want to do all the input processing yourself and not have any of Quest's normal handing kick in, then take that HandleCommand function I gave you before and gut it. Then put your own command handling logic inside. It will go through the standard Quest input mechanism, but you'll be able to do whatever you want with the input once it's entered. That would be simpler than using get input everywhere (in my opinion).",
