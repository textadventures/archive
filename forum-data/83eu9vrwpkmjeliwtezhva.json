      "EditableText": "Hello, \r\nFirst of all I apologize if this is either a simple fix or I'm doing something wrong- I'm new to all this so I don't know much. I'm having a problem when trying to use the Move to command to move the player to another room.  For example if I have the player interact with another character by using speak to or something else, and in the script it then says to: move object (player) to object (different room) it simply won't work when test playing the game. Using the command on other characters or objects works perfectly fine, just not on the player. What can I do to fix this, if anything?",
