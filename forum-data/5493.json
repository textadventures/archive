I went through the tutorials without much problems, but this is very new to me so I'll still need some time to get use to. \n\nAnyways, a question for the veterans.\n\nIs there anyway to remove the map functionality? I don't mean just the map, but the entire explore aspect. I don't really need it.\n\nAlternatively, using the Gamebook is a possible option - if only I could add the some of the features from the Text Adventure portion back in (Attributes and Player tabs, mainly)\n\nThanks in advance for helping the newbie!",

All I needed is the ability to make a text adventure that looks like a gamebook (a much better description) but with added functionalities like Health and other stats (like a RPG with an additional mana or power bar as well as physical/mental attributes). Success/Failures of actions will be determined by using &lt;, &gt; and = so nothing too complicated is involved.\n\nI'll take a look at the codes and will come back to the forum and see how it goes.
