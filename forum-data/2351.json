I want the rooms and the ojbects that were left about from the previous night to still be present, but a bit different as it will now be described the next morning.\n\nI know I can make copy rooms during creation, but my concern is having some objects present in those copy rooms. Some of these objects were droped by the player the previous night, and want those to be in the same rooms as well, or the same copy rooms.\n\nWondering if there is an easy way in the tool to do this.\n\nIf not, is there a function to replace one object with another object. Example, the previous night the player was able to get the dog out of the living room, and into another room and the dog was enjoying his food. Yet in the morning, when the player goes into the same room they left the dog at, i want to describe the dog as sleeping peacefully. The challenge is the player can leave the dog in any room and I have to account for that.\n\nThanks again for any help or ideas on resolving this.\n\nS",
