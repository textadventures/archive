I have no idea about code so is there a way i can do the above examples without coding?",

I'd just have an attribute on the player (maybe called &quot;gold&quot;) which is an integer, and it starts out 0 or whatever initial value you want. You can say they find 3 gold pieces, but all it does is add 3 to player.gold. Similarly, in your shop (however you implement it), each item would have an integer attribute like &quot;cost&quot;. And when they purchase the item, you'd just subtract item.cost from player.gold.\n\nI hope I didn't misunderstand your question! <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
