I want to be able to join multiple components found in the game to make one object. Specifically, the player finds a spellbook. One of the spells has multiple components that have to be found individually then mixed together in order to cast the spell. \nAn explanation or a link to it if it's already been covered would be much appreciated.

In the Use tab of the editor, say for the red potion, I would add use on (handle objects individually) (add) blue potion and then script what I want to happen (combine and remove the two potions and then move the purple potion to inventory).  On the BLUE potion use tab, I just copy-pasted the scripts I used for the red potion use with blue potion script.\n\nThe other option, which I did not include here (but will later for the tutorial) would be the use of commands.  You can add a command for the room like... use red potion on blue potion; use blue potion on red potion; use red on blue; use blue on red; pour red into blue; pour blue into red; mix red and blue; mix red and blue potions; mix blue and red potions; mix blue and red; ... etc, etc until you input in the command bar any possible text the player may type to mix the two potions together.  Then add your script as I did above.  Your method depends on how you instruct the player to make a combination.  If, for example, you specifically tell them to combine ingredient one with ingredient two, then I think I would use the command option, but if you want to use the generic method of use ___ on ___ (which is common for many/most TA's), I would use the method I mentioned above in code.  Or, if you really want to be a coding hero, you can do both and cover your bases for all possible combinations.\n\nI added a edible option for the 'love potion', too.  If you're curious, you have to click 'make editable copy' to alter the built-in edible command.\n\nLet me know if you have questions about this.  Also, there may be a better/simpler way to code this, but this is what I would do.\n\nGood luck!\n\nXanMag",

In the Use tab of the editor, say for the red potion, I would add use on (handle objects individually) (add) blue potion and then script what I want to happen (combine and remove the two potions and then move the purple potion to inventory).  On the BLUE potion use tab, I just copy-pasted the scripts I used for the red potion use with blue potion script.<br/><br/>The other option, which I did not include here (but will later for the tutorial) would be the use of commands.  You can add a command for the room like... use red potion on blue potion; use blue potion on red potion; use red on blue; use blue on red; pour red into blue; pour blue into red; mix red and blue; mix red and blue potions; mix blue and red potions; mix blue and red; ... etc, etc until you input in the command bar any possible text the player may type to mix the two potions together.  Then add your script as I did above.  Your method depends on how you instruct the player to make a combination.  If, for example, you specifically tell them to combine ingredient one with ingredient two, then I think I would use the command option, but if you want to use the generic method of use ___ on ___ (which is common for many/most TA's), I would use the method I mentioned above in code.  Or, if you really want to be a coding hero, you can do both and cover your bases for all possible combinations.<br/><br/>I added a edible option for the 'love potion', too.  If you're curious, you have to click 'make editable copy' to alter the built-in edible command.<br/><br/>Let me know if you have questions about this.  Also, there may be a better/simpler way to code this, but this is what I would do.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>XanMag",
