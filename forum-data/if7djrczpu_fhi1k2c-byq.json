For example:\r\n```\r\nPackOfCigars.parent=Player\r\n```\r\nAs for if it _has ever at one point been in_ the player's inventory, you need custom attributes for that. Like, say, for PackOfCigars have 'BeenPickedUp' as a true/false. And when you pick up the PackOfCigars, under the 'after this item is taken' run:\r\n```\r\nPackOfCigars.BeenPickedUp=True\r\n```\r\nHope this helps.",
