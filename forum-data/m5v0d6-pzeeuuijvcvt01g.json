I created an exit between the \"garbage collection room,\" and the \"pool.\" When I play my game and go to the garbage collection room, I can't go any further. The compass shows NO exits on it.

If you don't have an exit parented to garbage collection, then you probably have indeed created a one-way exit. You can either add the missing exit to the appropriate room or delete the one-way exit, re-select the two-way option, and recreate the exit.\r\n\r\nIf that's not the problem, the next thing I would check is to make sure that the Visible checkbox for your exit from the garbage collection room back to the pool hasn't been deselected. Also make sure you haven't accidentally made it scenery or a \"look\" direction.\r\n\r\nBeyond that? I'll let the Quest experts respond. But seeing as I have a game with 70 functioning exits, a mere 36 should not be the problem.",
