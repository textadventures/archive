I am a teacher and researcher at a university (psychologist at a business school), and I think that text adventures could be a very useful tool to study people's behavior. For example, do people with some personality characteristics make different decisions than others? Do people behave differently when they work under time pressure vs. no time pressure? Which choices do people make when they focus on achieving positive outcomes (find the treasure) than when they focus on avoiding negative outcomes (not get captured by pirates - or potentially more realistic settings).\n\nMy question is, is there a way to record the players' actions throughout the game, including the order / time of their actions? Perhaps into a text file or so? It would be a great way to have my students practice with designing simple experiments in a fun way.",
