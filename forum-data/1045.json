There's a few similarities to the game Mansion which I didn't actually play until I finished my own game so I don't want anyone to think I plagerized in any way.  Anyhoo, you can download it from [url:3edun01i]http&#58;//www&#46;savefile&#46;com/projects&#46;php?pid=822798[/url:3edun01i].  Enjoy!",
