I have done a quick search and couldn't find anything relevant.\n\nI currently only have QDK Lite, but am tempted to U/G.\n\nI would like to assign a random result (from a predefined list of &quot;rooms&quot;).  Ideally this is to be used with compass points rather than &quot;out&quot;.\n\nI am presuming I need to use the random command somehow, and attach a script to the exit, but how to write that script I am unsure.\n\nFor arguments sake, I have 3 rooms.  Room 1 is exitable by all 8 compass points, but the result of using any of the exits will be a random choice of one of the other two rooms.\n\nMany thanks.",
