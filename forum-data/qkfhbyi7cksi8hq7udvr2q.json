In the game they would be making ethical decisions and understanding how those decisions might impact others.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't see anything about the ability to see what choices people make in the story overall. Is this possible? It would be something that I'd be looking to be able to include in the results of my coursework.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you guys can give!\r\n\r\nRach227",
