Of course you get the fun factor of being able to crack a million jokes about starving ethiopians, but it tastes good and is hella filling. Most of the food is served as a lumpy mush, and consists of different piles of lumpy mush. You have potato, cabbage, beans, carrots, and whatever meats you eat(or want to eat). The meat is generally in a thick type of stew on about half of the platter and the vegetables occupy the other half. All of this is served on/in a large sponge type \"bread\" with a bunch of extra sheets of the \"sponge bread\" stuff(the bread tastes a lot like sourdough bread). You eat it by ripping a piece of said \"sponge bread\" from the sheet, and pinch the food(vegetables and meat) up in it, and eat it. It sounds really odd, but you gotsta try it. \n\nETHIOPIAN FOOD...
