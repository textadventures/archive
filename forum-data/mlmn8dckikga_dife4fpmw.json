I want to add some int variables so that I can use if statements to change the description of something (I was also wondering if you can make nested if statements but that can be done later).\r\nI was also wondering if you could move the player some were else on clicking a variable (ex: click touch on a big rock and it transports you to a room that you have to wait in before clicking continue and being moved back to the staring room)? ant help would be appreciated!",
