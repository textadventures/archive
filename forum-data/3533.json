The verb puts the appetizer in the player's inventory.  My burgertime turn script checks whether each item is in the player's inventory (with a series of nested if statements) and if yes then remove appetizers and make the main course visible and print a message.<br/><br/>Just one more bug to squash and my game will be playable!<br/><br/>Thanks for your help, all.  I think my next game will use the local client so that I have more freedom to customize the code.<br/><br/><pre><code>if (Got(beef)) {<br/>  if (Got(bun)) {<br/>    if (Got(cheese)) {<br/>      if (Got(lettuce)) {<br/>        MakeObjectVisible (hamburger)<br/>        msg (&quot;hamburger revealed!&quot;)<br/>        RemoveObject (beef)<br/>        RemoveObject (bun)<br/>        RemoveObject (lettuce)<br/>        RemoveObject (cheese)<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</code></pre><br/><br/>Got beef? <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
