      "EditableText": "Here's an example of how to do the map styling (attached and inline below). There are a few things to note:\n\n1) The InitUserInterface function sets the background color for the grid/map canvas to black.\n2) I imported the base &quot;defaultobject&quot; type into the game, so that I could set the default grid variables. That saves having to set them for every room.\n3) I imported the Grid_DrawLine and Grid_DrawPlayerInRoom functions into the game, so that I could override the hard-coded colors they use. (#202020 for grid fill, #101010 for grid border, and #7f7f7f for the player circle - based on the colors I could &quot;pick&quot; in the image you posted. The player circle is also expanded to 8 instead of 2, to fill the room box a bit more.)\n4) The rest of the game is just rooms.\n\nWith that in place, you should be able to just create rooms as normal. (Perhaps this should be moved into a library and allow the colors to be customized!)\n\n[code:11egidq6]&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;6&#46;5783&#46;24153--&gt;\n&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

      "HTML": "Here's an example of how to do the map styling (attached and inline below). There are a few things to note:<br/><br/>1) The InitUserInterface function sets the background color for the grid/map canvas to black.<br/>2) I imported the base &quot;defaultobject&quot; type into the game, so that I could set the default grid variables. That saves having to set them for every room.<br/>3) I imported the Grid_DrawLine and Grid_DrawPlayerInRoom functions into the game, so that I could override the hard-coded colors they use. (#202020 for grid fill, #101010 for grid border, and #7f7f7f for the player circle - based on the colors I could &quot;pick&quot; in the image you posted. The player circle is also expanded to 8 instead of 2, to fill the room box a bit more.)<br/>4) The rest of the game is just rooms.<br/><br/>With that in place, you should be able to just create rooms as normal. (Perhaps this should be moved into a library and allow the colors to be customized!)<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;6&#46;5783&#46;24153--&gt;<br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;
