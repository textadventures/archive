      "EditableText": "I'm using the 5.2 version of Quest in TA mode\n\nHi, everyone, I am really loving this software, thank you so much Alex, as I can try to make a game with it, something I always been interested in doing, but was never able to, due to having *ZERO* coding-programming knowledge, as well as not much $$ to spend on non-free software or whatever, so again, thank you so much Alex for this great free text adventure game making software!\n\nLike I've said, I'm a total noobie along with ZERO programming-coding ability-knowledge, but the tutorial has been really helpful as I've been trying to learn what I can, having some very small minor successes (but they're big ones for me, lol). I kinda get the basics used separately by themselves, but I'm so overwhelmed and confused by all the terms and stuff (values, attributes, variables, functions, scripts, commands, verbs, and etc), and thus I am especially confused with trying to use them together to actually do things, beyond their &quot;stand alone&quot; (specific and limited) uses in the tutorial. It's just all the cross-usage of all these things-terms confuses me, like if I do a script coding, if I also have to create attributes, functions, result, variables, commands, evaluate, etc as well along with the script. The tutorial works extremely well, I can understand it and follow along, but trying to apply what's in the tutorial to do stuff that isn't explained so directly in the tutorial, leaves me very lost.\n\nFor one example, I know that creating a start menu for a &quot;character creation&quot; (like picking race, class, etc) is quite advanced, though I'd like to understand how to do it (I've read the 3 threads-posts on it here in my fair searching and DL'ed pixie's (I think it is his-hers, my memory isn't the best, sighs) library on Race. But I don't know how to do the rest of the stuff, like make it apply to the player, the game, and whatever else (I can just make the most bare bones of the menu itself, lol).\n\nIf possible, more tutorials (of more things) would be extremely appreciated, as the tutorials are very step by step and well done, making it easy to understand what you're doing and how to do it, as at least for me, it's hard to apply what I understand to making-doing things on my own. (obviously, I got no coding-programming-designing-hacking-ingenuity-creativity skills, lol).\n\nanyways, my first actual question-request for help is on something I noticed in the tutorial (I'm trying to be smart and keeping my learning very small, small steps at a time, hopefully working up to understanding better on how to do the more advanced stuff.. I hope), so, here it is:\n\nit is about this specific part of the tutorial:\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/w/images/0/0c/Command.gif\">http://quest5.net/w/images/0/0c/Command.gif</a><!-- m -->\n\nand here's the ASL-Code that is provided as well:\n\n(I'd prefer help-guidance through the GUI, as I don't really got the coding down well enough to follow along, nor can I match the coding up very well with the GUI's buttons-windows-panes-options)\n\n &lt;command name=&quot;saying&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;pattern&gt;say #text_talk# to #object_troll#&lt;/pattern&gt;\n   &lt;script&gt;\n     if (object_troll.parent=player.parent) {\n       msg (&quot;You say: &quot; + text_talk)\n       msg (object_troll.name + &quot; ignores you.&quot;)\n     }\n   &lt;/script&gt;\n &lt;/command&gt;\n\nthis &quot;saying&quot; command with the troll is in this larger section, here: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Custom_commands\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Custom_commands</a><!-- m -->\n\nanyways, what I noticed was that the\n\nsay hi to troll ( say #text_talk# to #object_troll# ) with it's,\nIf,\nexpression object_troll.parent=player.parent ,\nThen,\nPrint expression &quot;You say: &quot; + text_talk\nPrint expression object_troll.name + &quot; ignores you.&quot;\n\n&gt; say hi to troll\nYou say: hi\ntroll ignores you.\n\nalso outputs this command with Bob:\n\n&gt; say hi to Bob\nYou say: hi\nBob ignores you.\n\nwhat, I'd like to understand is why is it also applying the command &quot;saying&quot; ( say #text_talk# to #object_troll# ) to Bob, when shouldn't it be only applying to troll due to the:\n\n#object_troll#\nobject_troll.parent\nobject_troll.name\n\nI don't understand why-how it is applying to Bob as well. Is there something I didn't add that is understood that I was suppose to do also (beyond what was shown in the tutorial for this command &quot;saying&quot; with the object &quot;troll&quot;), like creating any attributes and-or also defining the attributes-to-variable-to-function-or-whatever (see, I'm quite confused, sighs). So, this is a small step in me trying to understand more about this software and its coding, while it's not really that important, I'd like to understand why-how this is happening (and-or especially, if it's the case, of what I'm doing-done wrong or not even doing).\n\nI've done some various fiddling with the GUI's &quot;code&quot;, but I can't figure out why it's applying to Bob. Like for example, I tried removing the &quot;object_&quot;, but this didn't stop it from applying to Bob, and I also tried to change the &quot;_&quot; with a &quot;.&quot;\n\nSome of the fiddling, resulted in an error (I'd have to go back and reproduce this, which won't take long if need be) of something like &quot;variable object isn't recognized&quot; or something like this-to this effect, meh.\n\nAs, a quick 2nd question of mine:\n\nwhat is the &quot;_&quot; for anyways? Is it needed, doing it's own thing, like how the &quot;.&quot; does with the object.attribute (e.g. attribute thing I think with eggs.weight in the immediately following part of the tutorial) ? Or, is it just used as a way to distinguish from #text# (with the use of &quot;say #text#&quot; ) ?\n\nI know you want the game upload (do I have to put it into a zip file first or can I just directly add the .aslx game file as an attachment?), but it's just the tutorial game and its sections-topics of coding (which can be easily+quickly reproduced), so I'm not going to upload it, unless you really need it. I've done only minor extra stuff to the tutorial game, in trying to do some thing and testing some things out, as well as just additional practice of the tutorial stuff, to try to get my brain to understand and memorize what and how to do stuff, and-or what the stuff does, lol.\n\nyet for a 3rd time, thank you for this wonderful and free software, Alex! I love it, just need to now understand it better, to do more advanced stuff, hehe.\n\nA huge fan of your Quest text adventure software,\nHK",

      "EditableText": "Before I get into trying to tackle status attributes (and altering them: e.g. combat, level ups, learning abilities-spells, etc), I figured to start with trying to set up flags just for the character creation stuff (gender, race, class) so that it will (can be) applied to the rest of the game, if I understand this stuff correctly. I am aware about how coding scripts' variables or whatever can be only localized (it's only applied to within that script, and so outside of the script it doesn't exist), but I'm a bit confused in understanding what is and isn't localized, as I'm trying just learning scripts and hardly understand them and their parts and applications in context yet. Anyways, I tried to work on making it (player's gender, race, and class) be available outside of the Object -&gt; Game -&gt; starting script by making flags (for the then later &quot;IF has this flag&quot; stripts, to apply the character creation stuff to the right of the game when it is needed. I'm sure there's probably a problem with this method that I don't realize yet like when I am trying to apply changes to the attributes like in combat scripts, and-or it's horribly an inefficent method, and there's a much better way to do it, but this isn't my concern at the moment), but I'm doing something wrong (or missing something) as it's not recognizing the sub race of &quot;human/elf/dwarf&quot; as a variable or object (or at least that's the error message that comes up anyways). So, could I get some help on how to get this to work? hopefully, I'm 100% doing this in the right direction, and I'm just missing a few simple things for it to work, or at worst, this is completely the incorrect approach, which I'd apologize for, as this is just my own (guessing) attempt at trying to get it to work. There are posts about this stuff here and there throughout the forum, but it's really a hassle switching between multiple posts to read and try to make sense of. So, if I could get any help here (so it's all together) on how to do this, it'd be much appreciated!\n\nmaybe my problem is simply that I'm doing the set object flag script wrong (or am missing a part-step to it), as I've just been doing this from memory, not checking the tutorial about doing them (at least I think I remember the tutorial having gone over setting object flags... but maybe I read about them on the forum-wiki posts, meh. My memory isn't the best, I have to keep looking stuff up, and-or seeing again what are the steps of doing stuff-scripts-commands-functions-etc, lol).\n\nso here's my attempt at doing so, and hopefully it just needs some small tweeks/additions for it to work:\n\n[code:3or6d7pf]&lt;asl version=&quot;520&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;cd102f9d-370a-4bda-b6ea-ca42288f619c&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n      msg (&quot;What is your name?&quot;)\n      get input {\n        player&#46;alias = result\n        msg (player&#46;alias)\n        show menu (&quot;What is your gender?&quot;, split (&quot;male;female&quot; , &quot;;&quot;), false) {\n          player&#46;gender = result\n          if (HasAttribute(player, &quot;male&quot;)) {\n            SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;male&quot;)\n          }\n          else {\n            SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;female&quot;)\n          }\n          show menu (&quot;What is your race?&quot;, split (&quot;human;elf;dwarf&quot; , &quot;;&quot;), false) {\n            player&#46;race = result\n            switch (player&#46;race) {\n              case (human) {\n                SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;human&quot;)\n              }\n              case (elf) {\n                SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;elf&quot;)\n              }\n              case (dwarf) {\n                SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;dwarf&quot;)\n              }\n            }\n            show menu (&quot;What is your class?&quot;, split (&quot;warrior;cleric;mage;thief&quot; , &quot;;&quot;), false) {\n              player&#46;class = result\n              switch (player&#46;class) {\n                case (warrior) {\n                  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;warrior&quot;)\n                }\n                case (cleric) {\n                  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;cleric&quot;)\n                }\n                case (mage) {\n                  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;mage&quot;)\n                }\n                case (thief) {\n                  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;thief&quot;)\n                }\n              }\n              msg (player&#46;alias + &quot; is a &quot; + LCase (player&#46;gender) + &quot; &quot; + LCase (player&#46;race) + &quot; &quot; + LCase (player&#46;class) + &quot;&#46;&quot;)\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    &lt;/start&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;defaultplayer&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;turns type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/turns&gt;\n      &lt;statusattributes type=&quot;stringdictionary&quot;&gt;turns = &lt;/statusattributes&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;turnscript name=&quot;turns script&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;enabled /&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;\n      player&#46;turns = player&#46;turns + 1\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/turnscript&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:3or6d7pf]\n\nI think this is probably relevant to my problem in my coding not working:\n\n[quote=&quot;jaynabonne&quot;:3or6d7pf]I see something running through both of your questions. Let's tackle the first one first.\n\nA word about variables: a simple variable name used in a script, one which is not an object or an attribute of an object, is always a local variable to that script. In other words, it only exists within that script, and it goes away when the script exits. As you discovered, while you remain within the script, the variable exists. Once it exits... poof! And same named variables used in different scripts are actually different, unrelated variables.\n\nWhat you need is a global place to store your data. You almost (perhaps accidentally) got the answer in your question: &quot;So is there any way to create and add to a list that is remembered by the game?&quot;\n\nThe answer is to store the list as an attribute of the global game object (you could also store it as an attribute of the player). Instead of using CombatMenu, use game.CombatMenu. The former is a local variable. The latter is a persistent attribute of the game object.\n\nKeep in mind that if you do &quot;new string list&quot; every time you learn a new skill, then you will wipe out the old list. So you will need to check if the list already exists. If it does, then move onto to setting the new skill. Else create it first.\n\nYour second question seems similar. You want a way to associate a value with the enemy. The answer is the same: use an attribute. You can create an integer attribute (for example) on the enemy, and then decrease it by your &quot;dmg&quot; amount. If the value goes to zero or negative, then move the enemy off to some hidden room (I call mine &quot;Limbo&quot; typically) so the player can no longer see it.\n\nHope that helps![/quote:3or6d7pf]\n\nbut, I still can't figure out how to adjust my coding to get it to work.\n\nmy guess is that I'm not connecting (as I don't know how to do so):\n\n[player.race = result] to [switch (player.race)]\n~or~\n[player.race = result] to [case (human)]",

      "HTML": "Before I get into trying to tackle status attributes (and altering them: e.g. combat, level ups, learning abilities-spells, etc), I figured to start with trying to set up flags just for the character creation stuff (gender, race, class) so that it will (can be) applied to the rest of the game, if I understand this stuff correctly. I am aware about how coding scripts' variables or whatever can be only localized (it's only applied to within that script, and so outside of the script it doesn't exist), but I'm a bit confused in understanding what is and isn't localized, as I'm trying just learning scripts and hardly understand them and their parts and applications in context yet. Anyways, I tried to work on making it (player's gender, race, and class) be available outside of the Object -&gt; Game -&gt; starting script by making flags (for the then later &quot;IF has this flag&quot; stripts, to apply the character creation stuff to the right of the game when it is needed. I'm sure there's probably a problem with this method that I don't realize yet like when I am trying to apply changes to the attributes like in combat scripts, and-or it's horribly an inefficent method, and there's a much better way to do it, but this isn't my concern at the moment), but I'm doing something wrong (or missing something) as it's not recognizing the sub race of &quot;human/elf/dwarf&quot; as a variable or object (or at least that's the error message that comes up anyways). So, could I get some help on how to get this to work? hopefully, I'm 100% doing this in the right direction, and I'm just missing a few simple things for it to work, or at worst, this is completely the incorrect approach, which I'd apologize for, as this is just my own (guessing) attempt at trying to get it to work. There are posts about this stuff here and there throughout the forum, but it's really a hassle switching between multiple posts to read and try to make sense of. So, if I could get any help here (so it's all together) on how to do this, it'd be much appreciated!<br/><br/>maybe my problem is simply that I'm doing the set object flag script wrong (or am missing a part-step to it), as I've just been doing this from memory, not checking the tutorial about doing them (at least I think I remember the tutorial having gone over setting object flags... but maybe I read about them on the forum-wiki posts, meh. My memory isn't the best, I have to keep looking stuff up, and-or seeing again what are the steps of doing stuff-scripts-commands-functions-etc, lol).<br/><br/>so here's my attempt at doing so, and hopefully it just needs some small tweeks/additions for it to work:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;520&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;cd102f9d-370a-4bda-b6ea-ca42288f619c&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>      msg (&quot;What is your name?&quot;)<br/>      get input {<br/>        player&#46;alias = result<br/>        msg (player&#46;alias)<br/>        show menu (&quot;What is your gender?&quot;, split (&quot;male;female&quot; , &quot;;&quot;), false) {<br/>          player&#46;gender = result<br/>          if (HasAttribute(player, &quot;male&quot;)) {<br/>            SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;male&quot;)<br/>          }<br/>          else {<br/>            SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;female&quot;)<br/>          }<br/>          show menu (&quot;What is your race?&quot;, split (&quot;human;elf;dwarf&quot; , &quot;;&quot;), false) {<br/>            player&#46;race = result<br/>            switch (player&#46;race) {<br/>              case (human) {<br/>                SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;human&quot;)<br/>              }<br/>              case (elf) {<br/>                SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;elf&quot;)<br/>              }<br/>              case (dwarf) {<br/>                SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;dwarf&quot;)<br/>              }<br/>            }<br/>            show menu (&quot;What is your class?&quot;, split (&quot;warrior;cleric;mage;thief&quot; , &quot;;&quot;), false) {<br/>              player&#46;class = result<br/>              switch (player&#46;class) {<br/>                case (warrior) {<br/>                  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;warrior&quot;)<br/>                }<br/>                case (cleric) {<br/>                  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;cleric&quot;)<br/>                }<br/>                case (mage) {<br/>                  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;mage&quot;)<br/>                }<br/>                case (thief) {<br/>                  SetObjectFlagOn (player, &quot;thief&quot;)<br/>                }<br/>              }<br/>              msg (player&#46;alias + &quot; is a &quot; + LCase (player&#46;gender) + &quot; &quot; + LCase (player&#46;race) + &quot; &quot; + LCase (player&#46;class) + &quot;&#46;&quot;)<br/>            }<br/>          }<br/>        }<br/>      }<br/>    &lt;/start&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;defaultplayer&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;turns type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/turns&gt;<br/>      &lt;statusattributes type=&quot;stringdictionary&quot;&gt;turns = &lt;/statusattributes&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;turnscript name=&quot;turns script&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;enabled /&gt;<br/>    &lt;script&gt;<br/>      player&#46;turns = player&#46;turns + 1<br/>    &lt;/script&gt;<br/>  &lt;/turnscript&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>I think this is probably relevant to my problem in my coding not working:<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>jaynabonne wrote:</cite>I see something running through both of your questions.

Is my attribute syntax or status attribute syntax incorrect ??? Do I need to make a list ???",

You can set this same as the other attributes player.article=&quot;xxxx&quot;",

      "EditableText": "Actually,\n\nI've discovered that by taking out the expneeded = player.level * 100 + 100, the usage of expneeded in the rest of the scripts, produces very incorrect results-outputs, and I think the problem arises with the player.level = player.level + 1, as this seems to get applied to the rest of the script and-or as well with the looping of it as well, you end up get extra experience added, laughs.\n\nI don't understand why it produces the different and incorrect results-outputs, as shouldn't there be no difference between:\n\n(I'm going off of my memory, so this may be incorrect scripts, check the actual scripts I'll provide as the full game codes at the bottom)\n\nexpneeded = player.level * 100 + 100\nplayer.level = player.level + 1\nplayer.experience = player.experience - expneeded\n\nand (vs)\n\nplayer.level = player.level + 1\nplayer.experience = player.experience - player.level * 100 + 100\n\n...well...\n\nI guess, by looking at this just now, that by using the expneeded, it ignores the player.level = player.level + 1, which produces the correct-wanted-desired results-outputs, whereas by not using the expneeded it applies the player.level = player.level + 1, which produces very incorrect-unwanted-undesired results-outputs\n\nI'm sure the coding can be fixed to work without using the expneeded, but I can't figure it out myself.\n\nso, if any of you experts are interested in this issue, as maybe a challenge, to fix-work out, I'll provide the two codes, so you can test and solve the problem, just for the fun of it, as I can just use the expneeded myself.\n\n(or maybe I'm just messing up in my attempt to remove the usage of the expneeded, this could certainly be the case as well)\n\nhere's the code that uses the expneeded, which produces the correct results-outputs:\n\n[code:2h075hxk]&lt;asl version=&quot;520&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

      "HTML": "Actually,<br/><br/>I've discovered that by taking out the expneeded = player.level * 100 + 100, the usage of expneeded in the rest of the scripts, produces very incorrect results-outputs, and I think the problem arises with the player.level = player.level + 1, as this seems to get applied to the rest of the script and-or as well with the looping of it as well, you end up get extra experience added, laughs.<br/><br/>I don't understand why it produces the different and incorrect results-outputs, as shouldn't there be no difference between:<br/><br/>(I'm going off of my memory, so this may be incorrect scripts, check the actual scripts I'll provide as the full game codes at the bottom)<br/><br/>expneeded = player.level * 100 + 100<br/>player.level = player.level + 1<br/>player.experience = player.experience - expneeded<br/><br/>and (vs)<br/><br/>player.level = player.level + 1<br/>player.experience = player.experience - player.level * 100 + 100<br/><br/>...well...<br/><br/>I guess, by looking at this just now, that by using the expneeded, it ignores the player.level = player.level + 1, which produces the correct-wanted-desired results-outputs, whereas by not using the expneeded it applies the player.level = player.level + 1, which produces very incorrect-unwanted-undesired results-outputs<br/><br/>I'm sure the coding can be fixed to work without using the expneeded, but I can't figure it out myself.<br/><br/>so, if any of you experts are interested in this issue, as maybe a challenge, to fix-work out, I'll provide the two codes, so you can test and solve the problem, just for the fun of it, as I can just use the expneeded myself.<br/><br/>(or maybe I'm just messing up in my attempt to remove the usage of the expneeded, this could certainly be the case as well)<br/><br/>here's the code that uses the expneeded, which produces the correct results-outputs:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;520&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

(do tabs' controls conflict with, for examples: an inherited object type with an attribute int set to 0, or with using functions?)\n\n[b:16bwginv]question 4[/b:16bwginv]:\n\nDo I need to make object types for each equipment body part slot (head, feet, chest, waist, etc) ??

In my opinion, the basic answer to question 1 is &quot;yes&quot;, and the answer to question 2 is &quot;it depends.&quot; Let me expand a bit on that...\n\nWhile using types to give common attributes to objects is a good and handy feature of them, the general idea behind inheriting types (also known as &quot;subclassing&quot; in object-oriented circles) is that you want to define an &quot;is-a&quot; sort of relationship. For example, if you have trolls and demons and ogres and vampires and poisonous slugs, and you want them all to have similar properties but you also want them to be looked at as specific types of a generic class (e.g. &quot;monsters&quot;), then it makes sense to create that generic class type (&quot;monster&quot;) and inherit from it. It's reasonable in the sense of &quot;a troll is a monster&quot; and &quot;a demon is a monster&quot;, but it also helps if you want to have functionality that deals with things at the monster level, where you don't care what kind of monster it is. That's where the power really comes through, when you can write code geared toward an arbitrary monster (the inherited type) and then have all the monsters be handled the same way.\n\nSo, that is why I'd say the answer to 1 is &quot;yes&quot;. Given what you have said, you do want to treat the monsters (at least on some level) the same, with the same set of attributes, etc. When you write code to deal with a battle, for instance, you won't care if it's an ogre or a slug - just knowing it's a monster will do.\n\nFor question 2, well... &quot;it depends.&quot; It depends on what type of base object you want to define - you could just call it a &quot;BaseCharacter&quot;, which would generally apply. And as far as having common attributes, it could save you from having to define them separately for the player. But what keeps nagging me is: is a player, on any level, the same as a monster? Will you ever have a context where you would generically swap in a player vs a monster? I can think of some. For example, you might want to have some code for healing, where a monster would heal via the same bit of code as a player (e.g. hit points go up by the healing rate, etc). Or you might want to have code that deals with how much can be equipped by a character - monster or plaeyr (this is all off the top of my head, mind you <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> ). If that's the case, then I'd say it does make sense to have a common base type.\n\nAnother possibility: your battle system, rather than player vs monster, would be character vs character, where you could even have monsters (or whatever other non-player characters youhave ) battle each other. That would allow some to team up with the player and some not. But the battle logic would deal with just two base-level characters.\n\nFor me, the bottom line is: is there some common part of the player and the monsters where you'd want to treat the player or a monster in some generic way that is the same for both? Would you ever want to take that base type and perform some operations on it, just at the base type level? If so, then that generic core part (whatever you want to call it) would be a good base type. If the code for player and monsters will forever be separate, then there is no overlap, and it would make more sense (for me, from a design point of view) to keep them separate.\n\nI hope that helps. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

You can put in any value you want e.g &quot;finger&quot;, &quot;nose&quot; or even &quot;aaa&quot;. When equipping an item, the library checks all object of the type &quot;cmb_equipment&quot; if there is another item worn at this location and if so, it throws a message &quot;You can't waer another item at this location.\n\n[quote=&quot;HegemonKhan&quot;:19eadt8t]\nand the &lt;cmb_mod type=&quot;stringdictionary&quot;/&gt; contains the string ???\n[/quote:19eadt8t]\n\nNo, it contains a stringdictionary. It contains the attribute modificators, if this item is equipped. Something like \n[code:19eadt8t]&lt;cmb_mod type=&quot;stringdictionary&quot;&gt;at = +3;str = +1;hp = 21&lt;/cmb_mod&gt;[/code:19eadt8t]\nThe script reads all this values and increases ( or decreases) the actual attributes of the player\n\n[quote=&quot;HegemonKhan&quot;:19eadt8t]\nor does the '_mod' (in &lt;cmb_mod type=&quot;stringdictionary&quot;/&gt; ) means you're modifying the string script, as I see you using 'mod' elsewhere too (like on-in, '&lt;cmb_lvlmod type=&quot;stringdictionary&quot;&gt;1=at=1,pa=1;2=at=2,hp=100;3=str=4,at=1;4=at=2;5=pa=2;6=at=2;7=at=1&lt;/cmb_lvlmod&gt;' )  ??\n[/quote:19eadt8t]\n\nBe careful! The name of attributes does not include any logic! cmb_mod is defined in type cmb_equipment and all equipment objects should inherit this type.

A string list (which Quest often refers to as a stringlist) is a set of strings, but you can also have a set of scripts or objects.\nA list is specifically a sequence, with a first item, a second item, etc. Just to confuse you, the first item is indexed as 0, the second as 1, etc. But the important point is that you select the thing you want using a number, which is the things position in the sequence.\nWith a dictionary, on the other hand, you select the thing you want using a string, and this string is its key. For an analogy think of a real dictionary. It contains a whole bunch of definitions. To find the definition of the word &quot;house&quot;, you look up the word &quot;house&quot;, which is the key for that definition.\nA string dictionary uses a string for the key, and stores only strings, while an object dictionary uses a string for the key, and stores only objects.\n\nStrings, lists and dictionaries can be set up as attributes on objects, or can be used as variables in functions (in which case they disappear when the function ends).",

A string list (which Quest often refers to as a stringlist) is a set of strings, but you can also have a set of scripts or objects.<br/>A list is specifically a sequence, with a first item, a second item, etc. Just to confuse you, the first item is indexed as 0, the second as 1, etc. But the important point is that you select the thing you want using a number, which is the things position in the sequence.<br/>With a dictionary, on the other hand, you select the thing you want using a string, and this string is its key. For an analogy think of a real dictionary. It contains a whole bunch of definitions. To find the definition of the word &quot;house&quot;, you look up the word &quot;house&quot;, which is the key for that definition.<br/>A string dictionary uses a string for the key, and stores only strings, while an object dictionary uses a string for the key, and stores only objects.<br/><br/>Strings, lists and dictionaries can be set up as attributes on objects, or can be used as variables in functions (in which case they disappear when the function ends).",

This means that for an object scrpit, you can let the object define how to handle a certain instance. The caller doesn't even know what script is being invoked - it just calls the script member for the object. This is how different objects in Quest are set up to respond to verbs in different ways. It would be impossible (or at least extremely messy) to handle all the varying cases with a direct function call.\n\nSo, if you have code that will always be the same for all objects, a (direct) function might make sense.

(As I want to have a normal rpg-like &quot;equipment system-screen&quot; = equipment layers, equipment body part locations, and equipment level requirement too)\n\nI can't tell, but I don't think, Chase has a way of enabling the string dictionary for attributes for the equipment objects, like Pertex has, is this correct?\n\nwill chase's library be able to implement the actual combat system-functions-commmands, or do I really need to use Pertex' library structure for this instead?\n\n------\n\nalso,\n\nshould I just keep the equipment and spell libraries separate, but add them to my game file, or should I try to add the equipment and spell stuff together, like under the same tab (an all encompassing &quot;npc&quot; object type and-or a tab that handles even more stuff than just equipment and spells, such as like status attributes, &quot;thieving&quot;, and maybe &quot;diplomacy&quot; - err of what can be scripted as child of object type, as I now know thanks to Jaynebonne, most main scripting will be the game functions) under one library, or not?\n\nand so here's pixie's spell library as well:\n\n[code:2tvlbuvf]&lt;?xml version=&quot;1&#46;0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;library&gt;\n\n\n  &lt;!--\n  This library adds a basic magic system to quest&#46;

tab is added to the editor to make setting up spells and monsters as easy as possible&#46;\n  --&gt;\n\n  &lt;!--\n  Adding new elements involves a bit of effort&#46; This system requires that elements are added in pairs or opposites,\n  such as fire and frost&#46;\n  1&#46; Create a new type for both elements, named &#91;elemem&#93;_type\n  2&#46; In the data section, the object element_struct needs both elements added to both &quot;elements&quot; and\n      &quot;opposedelements&quot;, and for the latter you need to put them in both ways around (look at existing entries)\n  3&#46;

(human, elf, dwarf, orc, etc)&quot; or whatever else, but it'll take a bit more work, you may need help too on this, which I can help you with (you can see the bottom of this post, but I use an alternative character creation method. I can show you though also with this, &quot;using the lists&quot;, method as well).\n\n----------------------\n\nthis is long as it is an explanation of understanding stuff, but follow it (hopefully it will make sense, lol) and you'll get to where you put your character creation (&quot;CC&quot;) script block into the Code, via the Code View mode.\n\n@Icandoit,\n\nIn the GUI (?general? user interface = the noob-friendly mode with the click on-buttons-menus-windows and stuff):\n\nyou got the left side, which has your outline-tree of stuff:\n\nObjects\n-&gt;Game\n-&gt;-&gt;Verbs\n-&gt;-&gt;Commands\n-&gt;Room\n-&gt;-&gt;Player\nFunctions\nTimers\nWalkthrough\nAdvanced\n-&gt;Included Libraries\n-&gt;-&gt;English.aslx\n-&gt;-&gt;Core.aslx\n-&gt;Templates\n-&gt;Dynamic Templates\n-&gt;Object Types\n-&gt;Javascript\n\nin the Code View (there's a small button at the top of the GUI which toggles to this mode and the GUI mode, it's between the play and ? buttons, and looks like a piece of paper), it looks like this:\n\n[code:sm40x1o4]&lt;asl version=&quot;520&quot;&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n\n  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;cd102f9d-370a-4bda-b6ea-ca42288f619c&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;defaultplayer&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:sm40x1o4]\n\nIn the GUI, click on the 'Game' on the left side (the outline-tree of stuff).\n\nthis brings up, on the right side, the stuff we can do for the:\n\nObject -&gt; Game\n\nwhat you see on the right side in the GUI, corresponds to what goes within this section of the Code (in Code View mode):\n\n[code:sm40x1o4]  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;cd102f9d-370a-4bda-b6ea-ca42288f619c&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;[/code:sm40x1o4]\n\nso, (in the GUI mode and on its right side) try clicking now on the: Setup (if you aren't already on this tab button screen)\n\nObject -&gt; Game -&gt; Setup\n\nyou'll see:\n\nGame name: ________ (for me, the-my game file is called, &quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;)\nGame ID: some long collection-&quot;sentence&quot; of letters and numbers (this is known as a 'string' in the game coding, btw) that the quest game engine creates for identification - it's like a your game file's &quot;car license plate&quot; - we don't touch this in other words\nVersion: ___ (for me and you, it should initially be 1.0, unless you changed it)\nAuthor: ____\nCategory: ____\nDescription: ______\n\nDo you notice how this matches up with the Code View above? (try typing in the author and selecting a category in teh GUI, then take a look at the code, via the Code view. the description is for when-if you uploaded your game to Alex' site, for other people to download, they can see this &quot;description&quot; when they look at whether they want to download your game or not, so this description in the Object -&gt; Game -&gt; Setup -&gt; Description, is more like a &quot;game box' cover's&quot; description, so it doesn't appear within the actual playing of the game, nor in its code view mode too - I think lol)\n\nWhatever you do in this GUI's:\n\nObject -&gt; Game -&gt; (tab 1) Setup, or (tab 2) Script, or (tab 3) Options, or (tab 4) Display, or (tab 5) Attributes\n\ncorresponds to what is in between this Code (in Code View mode):\n\n&lt;game name=&quot;____&quot;&gt;\n(the GUI's Object -&gt; Game -&gt; 5 Tabs' changes go here, and also up above for the game name too, lol)\n&lt;/game&gt;\n\nnow, back in the GUI, click on the: Script tab (instead of the Setup tab)\n\nObject -&gt; Game -&gt; Script\n\nwhich you'll see:\n\nStart Script&#058; _____ (its a script selection pull down menu bar)\nTurns Script&#058; _____ (its a big box with an add button)\n\nif you were to create the character creation via the GUI, you'd do it via the Start Script&#058;\n\nObject -&gt; Game -&gt; Script -&gt; Start Script\n\nso, in Code View mode, it'll look like this (this is where you'll be putting it):\n\n(the indentation must be exact, you must line up each line to the other lines correctly)\n\n[b:sm40x1o4]each (or 1) indent = 2 spaces[/b:sm40x1o4]\n\n(I put in empty space lines, just so you can see the blocks and what sections, larger blocks, they're inside of)\n\nalso the indenting is *WRONG* here, as each line needs to be 1 more indent, 2 spaces, over to the right:\n[code:sm40x1o4]&lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n  \n  &lt;gameid&gt;cd102f9d-370a-4bda-b6ea-ca42288f619c&lt;/gameid&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n\n  &lt;start type=&quot;stript&quot;&gt;\n    msg (&quot;Let's generate a character&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;)\n    msg (&quot;First, what is your name?&quot;)\n      get input {\n        player&#46;alias = result\n        msg (&quot;Hi, &quot;

(try typing in the author and selecting a category in teh GUI, then take a look at the code, via the Code view. the description is for when-if you uploaded your game to Alex' site, for other people to download, they can see this &quot;description&quot; when they look at whether they want to download your game or not, so this description in the Object -&gt; Game -&gt; Setup -&gt; Description, is more like a &quot;game box' cover's&quot; description, so it doesn't appear within the actual playing of the game, nor in its code view mode too - I think lol)<br/><br/>Whatever you do in this GUI's:<br/><br/>Object -&gt;

And the game author can set those attributes via the attributes tab, rather than your custom tab, or directly in the code view; it is all the same.\n\n\nTypes are important during the game (er, except editor_object and editor_room, which disappear when you publish your game; be aware of that, but leave that to one side for now). Things in Quest have all the attributes that are set in their types, so if a type sets &quot;scenery&quot; to &quot;true&quot;, then all objects of that type also have &quot;scenery&quot; set to &quot;true&quot; - unless you specifically set it for that object. You do not have to use types at all, but if you have several things that  are similar, using types makes it easy, because you just set up the type once, rather than doing it for each one. Okay, you could copy-and-paste, but if you later realise you made a mistake or want them to do something else, you can change the type, and they will all get updated at once (that said, the way I do it is to create an object first, and get that working, then realise I want others like it, so create a type from that object).\n\n\nTemplates are a way to make it easy to convert to other languages. If you are creating libraries for your own use, do not bother. If you really want to know... There are two types of templates; templates and dynamic templates. Quest handles them very differently.\n\nA template uses the square brackets notation. When Quest reads your game file, it goes through it one line at a time. If it finds a template definition, it will make a note of it. If it finds square brackets, it will compare that against the templates it has noted and make the substitution (and this can even be in code). This means that your definition must appear in the code before the template is used. Now suppose someone wants to use your library for a German game. His German templates have to go into the code after the English templates (so the English ones are replaced by the German), but before the templates are actually used (otherwise it is too late). If you have a library file with templates at the top, and template uses scattered through it, well, there is no way for the German writer to insert his templates without modifying your file. So for a library you are sharing, there is not a lot of point in using templates (but it is vital for libraries that are part of Quest itself; these have the templates defined in another file, so the German author can insert his templates between the two). Now I did not realise all this for some time, so some of my libraries do use templates, and some do not.\n\nDynamic templates are handled very differently; Quest only handles them as and when the player needs to see that text, so they do not need to be defined before they appear in the code, and the hypothetical German author can set up his own dynamic templates after the library file has been included (so his dynamic templates will overwrite the ones in the library). So it makes sense to use dynamic templates in libraries you intend to share. However, I do not think dynamic templates can be used everywhere that templates can (for example for command patterns and displayverbs), so you end up with some libraries that are partly set up for other languages, and partly not.",

a (or like a) boolean (with its properties as core-internal quest data) ??? what are its properies ???\n\nwhat is the &quot;base_Container&quot;, what are its properties ???\n\nwhat exactly is the &quot;surface&quot;, what are its properies ??? (is the &quot;surface&quot; effected by whether I also have &quot;container&quot; or not ??)\n\nas I'm not sure what a &quot;container&quot; vs &quot;base_container&quot; is (and atm I forgot which inherits which too, lol)\n\n--\n\nthe reason I'm asking is that the attributes look a bit weird-wrong (in my game code above). is the container tab effected by my setting of the container types as inherited properties from new object types (as it still shows, &quot;Not A Container&quot; as its tab's control type's dropdowntypes' types' option-choice), does it matter what the container tab says, and-or do I have my container types wrong on my new object types? (or is the object types, the problem due to localness?). It still lets me place an object as the child though of my &quot;orc&quot; object.\n\n---\n\nalso, I'm thinking that I may want to make all my npcs as surface (or open) containers, as I'm sure objects can be coded with equipment too. this would also enable stealing of it, such as is implemented in the TES games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim), if I remember-got correctly lol, being able to steal their weapons or armors. My interest is to create as open a game as them, as is possible with Quest, as a text adeventure, anyways.",

a (or like a) boolean (with its properties as core-internal quest data) ??? what are its properies ???<br/><br/>what is the &quot;base_Container&quot;, what are its properties ???<br/><br/>what exactly is the &quot;surface&quot;, what are its properies ??? (is the &quot;surface&quot; effected by whether I also have &quot;container&quot; or not ??)<br/><br/>as I'm not sure what a &quot;container&quot; vs &quot;base_container&quot; is (and atm I forgot which inherits which too, lol)<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>the reason I'm asking is that the attributes look a bit weird-wrong (in my game code above). is the container tab effected by my setting of the container types as inherited properties from new object types (as it still shows, &quot;Not A Container&quot; as its tab's control type's dropdowntypes' types' option-choice), does it matter what the container tab says, and-or do I have my container types wrong on my new object types? (or is the object types, the problem due to localness?). It still lets me place an object as the child though of my &quot;orc&quot; object.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>also, I'm thinking that I may want to make all my npcs as surface (or open) containers, as I'm sure objects can be coded with equipment too. this would also enable stealing of it, such as is implemented in the TES games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim), if I remember-got correctly lol, being able to steal their weapons or armors. My interest is to create as open a game as them, as is possible with Quest, as a text adeventure, anyways.",

I think that I almost understand the general idea of it, at least the basic skeleton structure of creating a combat system. Though, I'm a bit confused about a few things with what you're doing in your combat library. I want to create my own combat system, but 1st I need to learn how to go about it, so I've been trying to understand yours, as I can't find any other peoples' works on combat for me to look at. Pixie does has a part on combat in his-her spell library, but it deals with using attack~damage spells, and so it's quite different from your physical~weapon combat system in your library.\n\nso, let me take a stab at seeing how well I hope I am understanding of a combat system and what you're doing in your library, and then I'll ask my questions about the parts I'm confused with, so that way, you can see where I'm stuck and~or confused, in understanding a (and yours specifically too) combat system in its general structure, as well as my specific questions on parts of it, of your library. so... here it~I go...\n\n(actually, I ask my questions first, and then give what I hope is the correct general structure of a combat system afterwards at the end~bottom of this post, sorry about the change up of order from what I said in the above paragraph!)\n\n----------\n\n1A. I'm unsure whether only the monsters inherit this object type, 'cmb_fighter', if only the player inherits this object type, 'cmb_fighter', or if both player and monsters inherit this object type, 'cmb_fighter'\n\n1B. as, there's also the object, 'cmb_intern', too, which I'm unsure with the 'cmb_attribs' of it, if that's only used for the player or for the monsters or for both player and monsters.\n\n2. first, there's: 'cmb_chkObject' and 'cmb_chkFighter' functions\n\nwhat are these or what do they do? I think I uderstand correctly that they get the equipment and~or the two battling objects (player and~or monster), but I'm unsure what~which does what~which.\n\n'cmb_chkObject' :\n\nplayer's equipment?\nmonster's equipment?\nplayer's and monster's equipment?\nthe player?\nthe monster?\nthe player and the monster?\nthe player and the player's equipment?\nthe monster and the monster's equipment?\nthe player, player's equipment, the monster, and the monster's equipment?\n\n'cmb_chkFighter' :\n\nplayer's equipment?\nmonster's equipment?\nplayer's and monster's equipment?\nthe player?\nthe monster?\nthe player and the monster?\nthe player and the player's equipment?\nthe monster and the monster's equipment?\nthe player, player's equipment, the monster, and the monster's equipment?\n\n3. I finally found possibly where 'cmb_object' and 'getObject' gets defined, which is in 'cmb_equip'\n\ndoes 'cmb_object' only refer to the equipment objects in your inventory, or just the monsters' inventories, or both player's and monsters' inventories, or does 'cmb_object' also refer to the monsters themselves and~or even the player too?\n\n4. I still can't find where or how the 'target' gets defined (or is this a code? but I type it in to the wiki search and I get no page on it), though I've found something on it in the 'cmb_loot', but this doesn't deal with the 'cmb_fight' nor 'cmb_attack', sighs.\nAs 'target', 'targetname', and 'target.name' gets used in 'cmb_attack' (and only 'target' and 'target.name') is used in 'cmb_fight'\n\nas there's the 'target' and 'object', especial in the 'cmb_attack', with the 'target=player -&gt; dead -&gt; game over' and 'object=player -&gt; dead -&gt; game over', so how or where does the 'target' and 'object'get defined between defining the player as 'target=player and as 'object=player'  ??? And this is also as &quot;vs&quot; the monster being killed within the same script block of 'cmb_attack'\n\n'target' :\n\nplayer?\nmonster?\nplayer and~or monster?\n\n'object' :\n\nplayer?\nmonster?\nplayer and~or monster?\nplayer equipment?\nmonster equipment?\nplayer and player equipment?\nmonster and monster equipment?\nplayer, player equipment, monster, and~or monster equipment?\n\nas I'm confused with... 'cmb_fight' and 'cmb_attack' .. due to mainly #'s 2 and 4, and see below\n\n5. so we got the command, 'attack', which calls upon the function, 'cmb_attack', based upon the player's (user's) text input.\n\nso the 'cmb_attack' is the battle system, between the player and the monster, so its mostly just, &quot;is monster here?&quot;, &quot;what monster?&quot;, &quot;is player here?&quot;, &quot;is monster dead?&quot;, &quot;is monster reachable~attackable&quot;, &quot;monster has died&quot;, and &quot;player is dead ~ game over&quot;. However, ther's this part of the 'cmb_attack' that seems to have a portion of the fight sequence:\n\n[code:297l8id0]\t} else if(cmb_chkObject(object) and cmb_chkObject(target)){\n\t\tif (cmb_fight(object, target)) {\n\t\t\tif (cmb_getAttrib(target,&quot;cmb_hp&quot;)&gt;0) {\n\t\t\t\tmsg( target&#46;name + &quot; hits back&#46;&quot;)\n\t\t\t\tcmb_fight(target,object)\n\t\t\t\tif (cmb_getAttrib(object,&quot;cmb_hp&quot;)&gt;0) {\n\t\t\t\t\tmsg(&quot;&quot;)[/code:297l8id0]\n\nwhich means that the 'cmb_fight' isn't the sole nor entire battle sequence function.\n\n[HK Edit: ooo, I was jsut looking at this, the code above, and I think I correctly realize that this is how fight turns are done: player does the fight sequence via the 'cmb_fight' , and then monster does the fight sequence via the 'cmb_fight', which is what this code does, YEAH! YEAH! I hope, laughs]\n\n---\n\nwhich then gets us to the: 'cmb_fight', as the main battle sequence function:\n\nthis sets up the attack, 'vattack', and the defend/parry/parade, 'vparade', but I presume this is for both the player and monster, enabling the player to be on 'vparade' and 'vattack' and the monster to be on 'vattack' and 'vparade', but how is this done, as I can't see how or where, the player and monster gets defined as 'target' and~or 'object', as well as in relation to what the 'cmb_chkObject' and 'cmb_chkFighter' are exactly doing as well, sighs.\n\n6. there's a lot of booleans used with return values. I presume that these, the 'handled', not handled', 'false', and 'true' are used to tell whether the function has been done~completed (such as with &quot;the battle is over&quot;) and~or to utilize it in another function.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nso the general format/structure/system for (physical) combat seems to be:\n\ncommand attack (calls the battle system fo player vs monster) based upon what the player (user) types in as input\n\nthe attack function (the battle system) has to then check that indeed the player's input is that of a monster that can be attacked, as well as checking for the player, the player's equipment, and~also the monster's equipment, so it can actually then get all of these things, in order to actually carry out the function, the battle.\n\nHowever, a battle system, needs the actual fight sequence function, lol.\n\nso we've got a fight sequence function, which just like the attack function, has to check and get the player, monster, player's equipment, and~or the monsters equipment. But, being that its the fight sequence function, it also has to set up the attributes of the fight, like the attack and defend values, as well as to set up how the player and monster actually fights each other, and lose hps based off of it, both for the player and monster, the player has to be set up to attack, defend, and lose hp, and so does the monster have to be set up to attack, defend, and lose hp.\n\nHowever, as seems to be the case in Pertex' library (if I understand it correctly), part of this fight sequence may be done within the attack function too, but I'm not sure what is exactly going on with it and~or how it is done or how it works.\n\nlastly, for all parts of this entire process of it all, booleans, ints, handles, values, trues, and falses needs to be set up as the various functions' returns, in order for the game engine to know whether it has been done~completeed or not yet.\n\nis this the general structure~system of creating a combat system?",

I never realized that the parameters acted like a sort of &quot;placeholder&quot; between parameters, of the left side of the comma and the right side of the comma.

I'm not that smart, sighs. It'd be like trying to create a boat, without ever seeing what a boat looks like, for me. Thus, by understanding Pertex' Library, I'd have at least a general idea, of a way of making a combat system, and then hopefully, with that I can then try to create my own, not something entirely different, but hopefully something different enough, that I could call my own, at least to a small degree.

I was looking for and wondering why there wasn't a 'targetname = text' or something like this, and then also trying to figure out how or where you had connected player=object or player=target and monster=object or monster=target.<br/><br/>I don't like bugging you guys-girls, but I was stuck on trying to understand the only example of a combat system, yours-Pertex, for like ~3 days, and had given up trying to understand it on my own, and nor was I able to figure out a way to create my own combat system all on my own, as I didn't understand enough about coding to do so, I probably still won't, but at least now, I think I should, hopefully, be able to understand better about functions, commands, and their parameters, to hopefully now be able to at least try to come up with a combat system on my own, regardless of whether or not it fails, as that would be a step forward for me, in of itself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm not able to just fumble around entirely on my own, in trying to create something on my own. I'm not that smart, sighs. It'd be like trying to create a boat, without ever seeing what a boat looks like, for me. Thus, by understanding Pertex' Library, I'd have at least a general idea, of a way of making a combat system, and then hopefully, with that I can then try to create my own, not something entirely different, but hopefully something different enough, that I could call my own, at least to a small degree. I hope as I understand more coding that it'll help me towards being able to code things entirely on my own and own created designs~structures~formats etc.<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>a real quick question about commands, as I still am just slighly confused with them:<br/><br/>is there any difference between:<br/><br/><pre><code>(code from Pertex' library)<br/><br/>&lt;command name=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;pattern&gt;attack #text#&lt;/pattern&gt;<br/>    &lt;script&gt;<br/>      cmb_attack (player, text)<br/>    &lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;/command&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>and<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;command name=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;pattern&gt;attack #object#&lt;/pattern&gt;<br/>    &lt;script&gt;<br/>      cmb_attack (player, object)<br/>    &lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;/command&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>(or is it suppose to be: )<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;command name=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;pattern&gt;attack #object#&lt;/pattern&gt;<br/>    &lt;script&gt;<br/>      cmb_attack (player, text)<br/>    &lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;/command&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>(or can it be ? : )<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;command name=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;pattern&gt;attack #text#&lt;/pattern&gt;<br/>    &lt;script&gt;<br/>      cmb_attack (player, object)<br/>    &lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;/command&gt;</code></pre>",

      "EditableText": "I have game files of where I can test it, but I haven't yet, I'm just really brainstorming via coding only, then I'll work out all the probably massive amounts of problems with it, laughs. I'm not in testing mode yet, I'm just trying to get an idea of the combat system down, and then I'll work on seeing if it works at all, and~or trouble shooting the parts with don't. I'm just trying to think of getting down the code structure of combat, and then once I got that, then it's a matter of actually going into the code and testing it, to get it working correctly, or what needs to be changed for it to work correctly.\n\nAre you already seeing huge problems with it? I was hoping to just be on the general right track, but maybe I'm completely off too. So, it'd be good to know, if this can be made to work, or if there's no way that this can be made to work.\n\n-----\n\nthough, I don't think I could even really test it, until I've at least got the combat actions filled in, and the handles-true-false-value-checks too. Integrating the combat actions will take a bit of work, such as with &quot;Fight&quot;, I'd have to set up the damage, dodge, to hit, block, equipment, and etc. Then, I'd have to figure out how to implement spells for the &quot;Cast&quot;. Then, using items for the &quot;Items&quot;, and then a way of ending the combat system, for &quot;Run&quot;. So, it's be awhile before it can really be ready just to do a testing of it.\n\nAlso, much of the code is incompleted, as I copy and pasted your (Pertex') combat library code as a foundation and reference, slowly adjusting it as I need to to match my new coding of it, so it's really not testable yet. For example, you've split the player and monster battle turns via the Attack function, whereas I'm trying to implement that all within the Fight function. But, I'm slowly adjusting and~or removing your code for the Attack function, as to match what I'm doing, but I haven't completed doing so yet, as I've still got a long ways to go. So, again, this really isn't ready for testing, not even priliminary testing. I guess you could just target pieces of it for testing if you want to test it now, but I'll be doing that as well myself, once I get my coding brainstorm done, in order to trouble shoot it. Working with individual pieces only will make the trouble shooting easier, then in trying to trouble shoot the entire code, obviously. I'm jut not at this point yet, as I want to just get some kind of code down first, and then I'll see if it works even at all or not. Then figure out how to adjust it, if it can be adjusted to get it to work.\n\n-----\n\nyou can use this as a foundation testing game file, but I haven't transfered (copy and pasted) over from other notepad file that has my worked on code, just yet. So, until I do, you'll have to do it, if you want to check it.\n\nmy testing game code:\n\n[code:1zzw7ll8]&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;3&#46;4762&#46;29157--&gt;\n&lt;asl version=&quot;530&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

      "HTML": "I have game files of where I can test it, but I haven't yet, I'm just really brainstorming via coding only, then I'll work out all the probably massive amounts of problems with it, laughs. I'm not in testing mode yet, I'm just trying to get an idea of the combat system down, and then I'll work on seeing if it works at all, and~or trouble shooting the parts with don't. I'm just trying to think of getting down the code structure of combat, and then once I got that, then it's a matter of actually going into the code and testing it, to get it working correctly, or what needs to be changed for it to work correctly.<br/><br/>Are you already seeing huge problems with it? I was hoping to just be on the general right track, but maybe I'm completely off too. So, it'd be good to know, if this can be made to work, or if there's no way that this can be made to work.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>though, I don't think I could even really test it, until I've at least got the combat actions filled in, and the handles-true-false-value-checks too. Integrating the combat actions will take a bit of work, such as with &quot;Fight&quot;, I'd have to set up the damage, dodge, to hit, block, equipment, and etc. Then, I'd have to figure out how to implement spells for the &quot;Cast&quot;. Then, using items for the &quot;Items&quot;, and then a way of ending the combat system, for &quot;Run&quot;. So, it's be awhile before it can really be ready just to do a testing of it.<br/><br/>Also, much of the code is incompleted, as I copy and pasted your (Pertex') combat library code as a foundation and reference, slowly adjusting it as I need to to match my new coding of it, so it's really not testable yet. For example, you've split the player and monster battle turns via the Attack function, whereas I'm trying to implement that all within the Fight function. But, I'm slowly adjusting and~or removing your code for the Attack function, as to match what I'm doing, but I haven't completed doing so yet, as I've still got a long ways to go. So, again, this really isn't ready for testing, not even priliminary testing. I guess you could just target pieces of it for testing if you want to test it now, but I'll be doing that as well myself, once I get my coding brainstorm done, in order to trouble shoot it. Working with individual pieces only will make the trouble shooting easier, then in trying to trouble shoot the entire code, obviously. I'm jut not at this point yet, as I want to just get some kind of code down first, and then I'll see if it works even at all or not. Then figure out how to adjust it, if it can be adjusted to get it to work.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>you can use this as a foundation testing game file, but I haven't transfered (copy and pasted) over from other notepad file that has my worked on code, just yet.

As I'm not sure what I need to do to get it to work, as I haven't worked out the code yet as to where I need to put the return values, or if its something else I need, then I don't know what it would be, and thus would need help too.",

As these two (there's a few more, smaller, functions too) functions use the return values, and etc, which I hope this is why it is crashing. I've been able to trouble shoot out the loading errors of my game file, and other errors with fighting the orc, but now after getting all these errors fixed, now I'm getting into these crashing errors in regards to my attempt at coding a combat system.\n\ncould anyone just look over the coding I have and see if I've done anything wrong, and~or if you spot anything missing, could you inform me of what I need to have where. I'll try to trouble shoot this as best as I can, but this is probably going to be too big for my to try to narrow down what my problems are, which are causing the crash, as I don't know coding as well as others yet, so it's much harder for me to try to trouble shoot, and also, I can try to keep doing the coding too, as maybe if I get it completed, and as well as possibly getting it set up the right way, maybe that will fix the crashing in of itself as well.\n\nI don't understand using functions' returning values yet, so if I could get help on these, I'd be appreciative, and hopefully it is these (missing) returns on the functions which is causing the crashes when trying to fight the orc.\n\nhere's my game file (remember that it crashes when you fight the orc):\n\n[code:2dbks4hd]&lt;asl version=&quot;530&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

As these two (there's a few more, smaller, functions too) functions use the return values, and etc, which I hope this is why it is crashing. I've been able to trouble shoot out the loading errors of my game file, and other errors with fighting the orc, but now after getting all these errors fixed, now I'm getting into these crashing errors in regards to my attempt at coding a combat system.<br/><br/>could anyone just look over the coding I have and see if I've done anything wrong, and~or if you spot anything missing, could you inform me of what I need to have where. I'll try to trouble shoot this as best as I can, but this is probably going to be too big for my to try to narrow down what my problems are, which are causing the crash, as I don't know coding as well as others yet, so it's much harder for me to try to trouble shoot, and also, I can try to keep doing the coding too, as maybe if I get it completed, and as well as possibly getting it set up the right way, maybe that will fix the crashing in of itself as well.<br/><br/>I don't understand using functions' returning values yet, so if I could get help on these, I'd be appreciative, and hopefully it is these (missing) returns on the functions which is causing the crashes when trying to fight the orc.<br/><br/>here's my game file (remember that it crashes when you fight the orc):<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;530&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

I also added in the ar to the ac lines, thus removing the note function of &quot;attack_rating_ar_vs_ac&quot; at the bottom of my previous code posting.

I also added in the ar to the ac lines, thus removing the note function of &quot;attack_rating_ar_vs_ac&quot; at the bottom of my previous code posting. I also added in some preliminary object types for when I get to doing equipment and spells. I'm still tryig to work on and figure out my own design for them, as I don't want to just copy pixie's, chase's, and yours-pertex's such libraries on equipment and spells. I want to try to design my own, as best as I can, anyways. the structure will be generally the same, as I can't come up with my own entirely unique structure for systems yet, and I'm not even sure if there's other or even worse, better structures to think up of, lol.

I may have to map this out visually, if no one can help me, as it might be too confusing for them too, lol)\n\nSo, I hope it just needs to be &quot;cleaned up&quot; with getting all the return false and true values set up where they need to be, and then in how and where (and what needs to be changed and~or moved around) to implement in a turnscript, so that I can enable and disable it via the return values of true false, which will thus be how I end the full combat system, out of the combat action.\n\n[code:34uvg1wk]&lt;asl version=&quot;530&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

I may have to map this out visually, if no one can help me, as it might be too confusing for them too, lol)<br/><br/>So, I hope it just needs to be &quot;cleaned up&quot; with getting all the return false and true values set up where they need to be, and then in how and where (and what needs to be changed and~or moved around) to implement in a turnscript, so that I can enable and disable it via the return values of true false, which will thus be how I end the full combat system, out of the combat action.<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;530&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;
