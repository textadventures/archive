      "EditableText": "Hello all! I am making a new Gamebook named Traders Guild. It will be a little different then other Gamebooks too. You will be able to choose a class, and each class belongs to a different Trading Guild. It means that each class is a different adventure. Each guild has 5 quests inside it, one of them a main quest. Currently, there is only 3 classes in the game. But the main quests are each different. I wont spoil anything, so I'll just say the Job Offers descriptions of the 3 main quests. The Mages quest one, has you investigating the dissapearence of local villagers. The Warriors main quest, has you destroying an ancient enemy. And finally,the Thieves Class pits you against a demonic force. I will probably release the GameBook in August or somethin'. Besides, its still a very, very, alpha version. 1.0.",
