The main requirement is to add 1,000 units to the purse when the player finds some money (they start with 50), and then 'pay bill' in the reception, which is a different room to my shop. Right now it returns, 'what do you think this is, a shop?' \n\nI assume I have to say 'when player has got the 1,000 in inventory, add 1,000 units to the purse', and then 'deduct 1,000 units from purse when bill and add a receipt to the inventory'.",

I've managed the first part ok but I'm a noob to script and I'm using 5.3, so what I need to know is which expression do I use on the wallet? The wallet contains €1000 so I want to add that to the purse once the wallet is picked up (and I guess the player should lose the €1000 if they drop the wallet). Using the WYSIWYG I'm on the wallet object, under 'After taking the wallet' I want to apply that line player.money = player.money + 1000. Alternatively, what would the script look like and where would it be placed?",

As it involves the complex stuff of Pixie's libraries)\n\n(you simply need to use the scripts, they're your rewards and fines, this is how money works in this game, via reward and fines scripts, so there's no actual physical objects moving around, only DATA amounts, from one object's money attribute to another object's money attribute)\n\nbut, so, instead, for the wallet all we have to do, is the same thing we did with the player, give the &quot;wallet&quot; its own &quot;purse&quot;, by:\n\nfor your &quot;wallet&quot; object, give it the attribute:\n\nname=money\ntype=integer (int)\namount set: 1000\n\n---------\n\nthe two scripts you need to know~use:\n\nobject = player, receptionist, wallet, or demonboy_games_inc\n\n&quot;reward script&quot;

As it involves the complex stuff of Pixie's libraries)<br/><br/>(you simply need to use the scripts, they're your rewards and fines, this is how money works in this game, via reward and fines scripts, so there's no actual physical objects moving around, only DATA amounts, from one object's money attribute to another object's money attribute)<br/><br/>but, so, instead, for the wallet all we have to do, is the same thing we did with the player, give the &quot;wallet&quot; its own &quot;purse&quot;, by:<br/><br/>for your &quot;wallet&quot; object, give it the attribute:<br/><br/>name=money<br/>type=integer (int)<br/>amount set: 1000<br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>the two scripts you need to know~use:<br/><br/>object = player, receptionist, wallet, or demonboy_games_inc<br/><br/>&quot;reward script&quot;
