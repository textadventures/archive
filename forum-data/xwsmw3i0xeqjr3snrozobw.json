      "EditableText": "\r\nI could take on the NPM packages... I didn't want to suggest myself because I tend to only check in here around once or twice a year, only hanging around for a few weeks. But then, I also don't have any responsibilities on this site at the moment that I have to think about at all, so...\r\n\r\nFor the Squiffy editor being out of date, yes the Electron is out of date by a lot... but there's good guides on how to fix that on the net, and so it isn't actually the main problem. I have actually already done most of that work...\r\n\r\nMore importantly there are some packages it relies on that seem to have serious security issues, or no longer work with the latest versions of Electron, and are no longer maintained.\r\nSome features of jquery it uses no longer exist, and I didn't find any suggestions on a way forward for those. Personally I'm not a fan of jquery, and I'm tempted to remove it from the editor. \r\nNot from actual Squiffy though - that would be foolish as it's something the users of Squiffy rely on. Also, updating Squiffy's jquery to the latest was a simple matter, and keeping it up to date is no trouble. So no problems there with Squiffy itself.\r\n\r\nHaving the editor on the website updated to modern standards and using a responsive design for people on tablets/phones I think will be a very important step for people wanting to get into Squiffy.\r\n\r\nThe online Squiffy scratchpad is also broken, but I don't know anything about where that lives. I think the scratchpad just needs to be updated to latest jquery and probably look at a local site version rather than using a cross-site request.\r\n\r\nI think I will look into making a vscode addon - I for one am more likely to use that than the local editor.\r\nI already use vscode for pretty much everything 😀\r\n",

I have actually already done most of that work...</p>\n<p>More importantly there are some packages it relies on that seem to have serious security issues, or no longer work with the latest versions of Electron, and are no longer maintained.<br>\nSome features of jquery it uses no longer exist, and I didn't find any suggestions on a way forward for those. Personally I'm not a fan of jquery, and I'm tempted to remove it from the editor.<br>\nNot from actual Squiffy though - that would be foolish as it's something the users of Squiffy rely on. Also, updating Squiffy's jquery to the latest was a simple matter, and keeping it up to date is no trouble. So no problems there with Squiffy itself.</p>\n<p>Having the editor on the website updated to modern standards and using a responsive design for people on tablets/phones I think will be a very important step for people wanting to get into Squiffy.</p>\n<p>The online Squiffy scratchpad is also broken, but I don't know anything about where that lives.
