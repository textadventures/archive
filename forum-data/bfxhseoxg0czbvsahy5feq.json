The Popup function added semi-recently is a neat little addition to the Text Processor's capabilities, an obvious application of it being to include information that, while not strictly relevant to a scene at hand, may be of interest to the player.

This can be used with the img command to have an image pop-up.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue I've run into, however, is that lack of ability to have further text processor directives nested within it.
