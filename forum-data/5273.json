      "EditableText": "I'm using some of your libraries (yes, you are credited in game, don't worry) in my game but I have NO idea how do go about customizing things in your libraries, nor can I follow your instructions at all. Maybe I'm just too dumb to comprehend your explanations but some clarity would be greatly appreciated. Just talk to me like I'm a two year old so I understand. This has to do particularly with your &quot;ConvLib&quot; and &quot;CombatLib&quot;. I've looked at both pretty extensively in the Notepad++ which HK suggested I get some time ago when I was first trying to understand code. \n\nMy first question is in regards to your &quot;ConvLib&quot; comes from this...\n\nI would like a character to have &quot;topics&quot; to discuss/ask after the player initially &quot;Speak to&quot; them. So naturally I was very confused about how to do that in your library. So anyway, I checked out the ConvLib in Notepad++ because in another post you explained to someone that everything is there and I looked and saw...\n\n[quote:3qbou5o7]  * Set an alias\n  * Set them to the type &quot;topic&quot; or &quot;startingtopic&quot;, the latter will be visible from the start.\n  * Give it a script called talk; this is run when the character is asked about the topic.\n  * The topic will automatically disappear once the player has seen it. Set hideafter to false to\n    stop this happening automatically (call the &quot;hide&quot; script to do it yourself).\n  * The count attribute notes how many times the character has been asked about this topic previously\n    (so is zero the first time).\n  * If you want new topics to be available after reading this one, put the names of the new topics in\n    the shownow list.[/quote:3qbou5o7]\n\nI don't know about anyone else but I can't figure out a word of this. There are three topics as follows...\n[u:3qbou5o7]Conversation Tab[/u:3qbou5o7]\n     [i:3qbou5o7]None\n        Character\n        Conversation Topic\n        Starting Conversation Topic[/i:3qbou5o7]\n\nNow initially I thought, oh I set up the character first, so I clicked it. All I see are...&quot;Run this greeting script&quot; ....which I didn't need really because I couldn't get it to work. BUT I looked at your directions &quot;Set an alias&quot;. I assumed I do that in that &quot;Run this greeting script&quot; box. So I typed{specificcharacter.alias} for example in &quot;Print&quot; assuming it would understand that it was coming from that character. That didn't work. Okay, what did I do wrong? So I continue to try, and look at your directions again. Set them to the [i:3qbou5o7]type [/i:3qbou5o7]&quot;topic or starting topic&quot;.....What? I have no idea what this means. There is no script that I know named &quot;talk&quot;. Do I type this in &quot;Print&quot;? I don't know how to do this step at all.\n\nAnyway, so I moved onto the next one. I understand that topics will disappear after they are chosen. Which is fine with me. Count attribute I understand. I clicked &quot;Conversation topic&quot; next. Automatically hide after showing. Got it and understand. Topics will disappear. Then I read this... &quot;Show these after showing for the first time (must be the name, not the alias)&quot; which I think I understand...so I create a topic with the &quot;Add&quot;, then I look below at &quot;Run this script&quot; but again, I have NO idea how to tie that in with each of the conversation topics. I'm at a loss now and I no idea how/why this is so complicated for me to understand. So next I move to the &quot;Starting Conversation Topic&quot; and again, same thing as above. No idea how to get the player and the character to talk. The Ask/Tell thing is extremely limited to 'yes' and 'no' topics as well, which doesn't help.\n\nWould you mind explaining this to me step by step? Maybe using both code and the GUI or just the code if you don't have time or patience to do both?\n\nThe next problem I had is with the &quot;CombatLibrary&quot;\n\nI read your 'notepad' on how everything works and it's semi-straight forward and well-described....until I reach the customization part of it. Very confusing. So I understand the gold, maxpoints, nameprompt, pointsprompt and understand when those things happen in the game, but the kicker is when you say &quot;search for Boris&quot; I figured, he/she must mean type &quot;Boris&quot; in the Notepad++ search box. Nothing came up. So I try it in the game itself in the code-view. Nothing came up. I try it again in the Filter, ShowLibraryMenu, nothing. I don't know if Boris is code for something...but I don't understand it. \n\nAlso, is there a way to add onto the character customization attribute...like picking a race, gender (I'd like to remove the outer prompt for gender selection and just have it be something you can select if possible), body type, haircolor, eyecolor ---- etc? I'd also like to change Hit Points to &quot;Health&quot; ....and figure out a way to make &quot;Scripted&quot; events drain it --- not just in combat, if that's possible. Also, is it possible for enemies not to &quot;kill&quot; you with a gameover, but defeat you and disappear like stealing stuff from you etc, or just leaving you there with 1 Health?\n\nI apologize for all the questions, but I have a genuine curiosity/interest about how your libraries work. I'd love to optimize them for my game and credit you. A detailed explanation of everything would be greatly appreciated! Again, sorry for the huge topic.",

Of course, it would be wonderful too if each item could be applied to the correct slot too, for example &quot;Clothing_Feet&quot; would fit the shoe/boot. \n\nDoes that make sense?",

Make it just return 0.<br/><br/>Check the game will play. Very likely there will be other bits you need to change, so good luck!<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Step 2</span>: Add the wearables library. Add your armour items (at least enough to test with).<br/><br/>Check the game will play. <br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Step 3</span>: Modify your GetArmour function. If the foe is the player, get a value for the amour, based on what the player is wearing. Otherwise return foe.armour.<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Step 4</span>: Bear in mind that the system assumes armour ranges from 0 to 4, which is not much of range for what you want to do - with only five different values, there is not much scope for variety. You may need to tweak the combat mechanics to make the system meaningful. Is there actually any difference between going barefoot and wearing steel boots? This is part of the reason I choice not to go this route, the other reason being I did not want to have to implement literally hundreds of bits of armour for my game.</blockquote><br/><br/><br/>^------ I tried all of this but nothing seemed to happen. <br/><br/>On that note though...<br/><br/>[quote=&quot;The Pixie&quot;]I think HK is suggesting a system where the player wears a piece of armour on a certain location - chainmail gauntlets on the hands, or a leather cuirass on the chest (like the Elder Scrolls games for example).<br/><br/>^--- I wouldn't mind this at all, that's why I was going with the idea. I don't really mind if none of the clothing has armor or not (for the time being). <br/><br/>Clothing_Feet<br/>Clothing_Head<br/>Clothing_Chest<br/>Clothing_Inner_Chest<br/>Clothing_Pelvis<br/>Clothing_Shoulders<br/>Clothing_Legs<br/>Clothing_Right_Hand<br/>Clothing_Left_Hand<br/>Clothing_Ears<br/>Clothing_Fingers<br/>Clothing_Neck<br/><br/>HK helped me come up with these item slots, and I've already applied them to the player_object. The problems I have now is a way for items such as the starting shirt &quot;Plain black shirt&quot; and the starting &quot;backpack&quot;, &quot;pants&quot; and &quot;shoes&quot; and whatnot to display &quot;worn&quot; in the inventory pane, and to make it so that the clothing....let's say the player finds another shirt, for example can't be overlapped. Of course, it would be wonderful too if each item could be applied to the correct slot too, for example &quot;Clothing_Feet&quot; would fit the shoe/boot. <br/><br/>Does that make sense?",

So, don't get scared by the error messages and especially not if your game file won't go into the GUI~Editor, or won't play, as it's just a code issue that you caused (usually some stupid typo or missing character or mispelling or etc something stupid and small, ARGH, lol), which we can still get into your game file's code (open game file with a text software: notepad,wordpad,notepad++,etc), and fix it up, so it works again. So don't worry! <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> (someone has asked this very question: they're unable to get into the GUI~Editor or play with their game file, Jay and I will have his~her game file back working in no time, hehe. here's the link: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://ifanswers.com/841/is-there-a-known-bug-with-commands-not-functioning\">http://ifanswers.com/841/is-there-a-kno ... unctioning</a><!-- m --> , err nvm, I'm hallucinating... they can still get into their game, lol, just just have an issue with their 'say' Command not working... wow, HK is~was really hallucinating... haha. oopsy. errr 2.0, lol. I wasn't hallucinating... I just got confused~wasn't paying attention, and looked at the wrong question. here's the correct link: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://ifanswers.com/823/quest-game-wont-open-for-edit\">http://ifanswers.com/823/quest-game-wont-open-for-edit</a><!-- m --> )\n\n(though, I'm not sure if you change the underlying game code stuff, if that will mess up your game file or not. Have to ask Pixie about that. Quest is safe though through the GUI~EDitor, as alex has it so that it forces you to 'copy' before you change the underlying code, thus preserving the underlying code and quest from being messed up. But I don't know how it works with your game file itself, if it can be fixed up or not)\n\nnow if you actually go into the quest's folders 'core' files, than you're directly accessing the quest engine ~underlying code files, and messing them up will make quest unusable (you'd have to re-download and install quest again). So, you should not ever do this, unless you're a good programmer, and are able to do so without messing anything up, and creating your own entire engine (which quest enables ~ it's very well built~powerful, if you're a good programmer, anyways), lol.\n\n---------------------\n\nokay... here we go... lol\n\nfirst of all, code can be written vertically and~or horizontally. Hackers (and expert~top programmers) can read+write+troubleshoot code horizontally, but especially for us code noobs, vertical is so much easier to read, write, troubleshoot, and work with, as can be seen, using the default new game code:\n\nfor short code (like for most types of Attributes), we can manage horizontal, and thus we use it, but otherwise, vertical is much better for us.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n(I haven't tested if quest supports everything as horizontal code... I should go test it, for actual fun, I'm interested if it can, hehe)\n\n[code:6vy4q4gj]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;&lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;&lt;game name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;&lt;gameid&gt;xxx&lt;/gameid&gt;&lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;&lt;firstpublished&gt;2015&lt;/firstpublished&gt;&lt;/game&gt;&lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;&lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot;&gt;&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;&lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;&lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:6vy4q4gj]\n\nYUCK! This is totally unreadable for me (though a hacker or expert~top programmer can read this as if they were reading a book... crazy, huh, sighs)\n\nHackers (or expert~top programmers) like it due to it being so much more concise, only 3 lines! 3 lines! lol.\n\n(and if you wanted~needed to print out code, you're saving A LITERAL TON of paper to print out horizontal code, compared to vertical code: most OS', like win xp~7~8, the apple OS', and etc OS', are like at least 50 million lines of code! And that's expert~efficient code, and probably it is already done as horizontal code too... that's A LOT of characters, A LOT of typing... lol)\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n[code:6vy4q4gj]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;xxx&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2015&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:6vy4q4gj]\n\nah, this is so much better, I can understand this stuff now!

I'm going to describe it untechnically, in a way that makes sense for me, and hopefully it will make sense for you too.\n\none type of code, is what I call the 'creation tag code blocks~lines' (or as Pixie technically explained: the 'XML' code), these are the 'physical things' in your code. Besides the default 'physical things' (like the special 'game' Game Object, the 'player' Player Object, the 'room' Room Object, and the two libraries: 'English.aslx' and 'Core.aslx', which the engine has already added into your game for you), these are the exact same things as when you do the 'add -&gt; Object~Exit~Verb~Function~Command~Attribute~Object Type~etc' in the GUI~Editor (in fact, go ahead and try it out: add an Object in the GUI~Editor, and then look at your game code, and find its 'creation tag code block~line' that is now added to your game code!, hehe). Any, block or line, that has the '&lt;&gt;' tags is our 'physical things', our 'creation tag code block~line', as seen below:\n\n[code:6vy4q4gj]&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;\n  xxx\n&lt;/xxx&gt;\n\n&lt;xxx&gt;xxx&lt;/xxx&gt;\n\n&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;xxx&lt;/xxx&gt;\n\n&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot; /&gt;\n\n~OR, a bit more descriptively for you ~\n\n&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;\n  content\n&lt;/xxx&gt;\n\n&lt;xxx&gt;content&lt;/xxx&gt;\n// this is also a shortened form of specifically~only&#58; String Attributes\n\n&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;content&lt;/xxx&gt;\n// this is the full form (aka the normal) syntax\n\n&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot; /&gt;\n// this is understood content (and thus has this unique shortened form seen above)&#58; its a Boolean Attribute with the Value of true[/code:6vy4q4gj]\n\nso try to see the code as these 'creation tag code blocks' and creation tag code lines', for example:\n\nyou want to be able to see this:\n\n[code:6vy4q4gj]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

So, don't get scared by the error messages and especially not if your game file won't go into the GUI~Editor, or won't play, as it's just a code issue that you caused (usually some stupid typo or missing character or mispelling or etc something stupid and small, ARGH, lol), which we can still get into your game file's code (open game file with a text software: notepad,wordpad,notepad++,etc), and fix it up, so it works again. So don't worry! <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> (someone has asked this very question: they're unable to get into the GUI~Editor or play with their game file, Jay and I will have his~her game file back working in no time, hehe. here's the link: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://ifanswers.com/841/is-there-a-known-bug-with-commands-not-functioning\">http://ifanswers.com/841/is-there-a-kno ... unctioning</a><!-- m --> , err nvm, I'm hallucinating... they can still get into their game, lol, just just have an issue with their 'say' Command not working... wow, HK is~was really hallucinating... haha. oopsy. errr 2.0, lol.

Have to ask Pixie about that. Quest is safe though through the GUI~EDitor, as alex has it so that it forces you to 'copy' before you change the underlying code, thus preserving the underlying code and quest from being messed up. But I don't know how it works with your game file itself, if it can be fixed up or not)<br/><br/>now if you actually go into the quest's folders 'core' files, than you're directly accessing the quest engine ~underlying code files, and messing them up will make quest unusable (you'd have to re-download and install quest again). So, you should not ever do this, unless you're a good programmer, and are able to do so without messing anything up, and creating your own entire engine (which quest enables ~ it's very well built~powerful, if you're a good programmer, anyways), lol.<br/><br/>---------------------<br/><br/>okay... here we go... lol<br/><br/>first of all, code can be written vertically and~or horizontally. Hackers (and expert~top programmers) can read+write+troubleshoot code horizontally, but especially for us code noobs, vertical is so much easier to read, write, troubleshoot, and work with, as can be seen, using the default new game code:<br/><br/>for short code (like for most types of Attributes), we can manage horizontal, and thus we use it, but otherwise, vertical is much better for us.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------<br/><br/>(I haven't tested if quest supports everything as horizontal code... I should go test it, for actual fun, I'm interested if it can, hehe)<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;&lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;&lt;game name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;&lt;gameid&gt;xxx&lt;/gameid&gt;&lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;&lt;firstpublished&gt;2015&lt;/firstpublished&gt;&lt;/game&gt;&lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;&lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot;&gt;&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;&lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;&lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>YUCK! This is totally unreadable for me (though a hacker or expert~top programmer can read this as if they were reading a book... crazy, huh, sighs)<br/><br/>Hackers (or expert~top programmers) like it due to it being so much more concise, only 3 lines! 3 lines! lol.<br/><br/>(and if you wanted~needed to print out code, you're saving A LITERAL TON of paper to print out horizontal code, compared to vertical code: most OS', like win xp~7~8, the apple OS', and etc OS', are like at least 50 million lines of code! And that's expert~efficient code, and probably it is already done as horizontal code too... that's A LOT of characters, A LOT of typing... lol)<br/><br/>----------------------------------------<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;xxx&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2015&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>ah, this is so much better, I can understand this stuff now!

I'm going to describe it untechnically, in a way that makes sense for me, and hopefully it will make sense for you too.<br/><br/>one type of code, is what I call the 'creation tag code blocks~lines' (or as Pixie technically explained: the 'XML' code), these are the 'physical things' in your code. Besides the default 'physical things' (like the special 'game' Game Object, the 'player' Player Object, the 'room' Room Object, and the two libraries: 'English.aslx' and 'Core.aslx', which the engine has already added into your game for you), these are the exact same things as when you do the 'add -&gt; Object~Exit~Verb~Function~Command~Attribute~Object Type~etc' in the GUI~Editor (in fact, go ahead and try it out: add an Object in the GUI~Editor, and then look at your game code, and find its 'creation tag code block~line' that is now added to your game code!, hehe). Any, block or line, that has the '&lt;&gt;' tags is our 'physical things', our 'creation tag code block~line', as seen below:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;<br/>  xxx<br/>&lt;/xxx&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;xxx&gt;xxx&lt;/xxx&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;xxx&lt;/xxx&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot; /&gt;<br/><br/>~OR, a bit more descriptively for you ~<br/><br/>&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;<br/>  content<br/>&lt;/xxx&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;xxx&gt;content&lt;/xxx&gt;<br/>// this is also a shortened form of specifically~only&#58; String Attributes<br/><br/>&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;content&lt;/xxx&gt;<br/>// this is the full form (aka the normal) syntax<br/><br/>&lt;xxx xxx=&quot;xxx&quot; /&gt;<br/>// this is understood content (and thus has this unique shortened form seen above)&#58; its a Boolean Attribute with the Value of true</code></pre><br/><br/>so try to see the code as these 'creation tag code blocks' and creation tag code lines', for example:<br/><br/>you want to be able to see this:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;xxx&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2015&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot;

So, I started over, but I've been busy with other stuff, so haven't made much new attempted progress, sighs.<br/><br/>******************<br/>example of the above design system I'm failing to code (using equipment~armor~weapons + clothing), as quasi-pseudo code:<br/><br/>(if the Object is in, added to, the Objectlist Attributes, it is 'equipped' on you)<br/><br/>player.chest_objectlist_attribute = shirt (layer 0), some type of energy absorption material over-shirt (layer 1), plate mail (layer 2)<br/><br/>player.waist_objectlist_attribute = undies (layer 0), some type of energy absorption material pants (layer 1), belt to hold up the energy absoption material (layer 2), plate armor (layer 3)<br/>******************<br/><br/>Chase's and Pixie's Libraries are so nice, while I struggle so much with my own design system with equipment. Their libraries make it look so easy, but it's not, at last not for me. The problem is that even if I am finally successful at a sample game of a design~system for equipment, it's going to be so messy ~ ugly ~ poor, that why would you or anyone even want to see~use it, when you've~they got Pixie's and Chase's, both of which are really good, excellent, and concise, in quality.<br/><br/>I'm going to keep working on it, as I got the time, but try to get help from others, as this is still beyond my abilities (I had thought~hoped that I could do this stuff now, but am finding that I still can't yet do this level of stuff yet, sighs)<br/><br/>----------------------------<br/><br/>your hair~nail growth stuff (aka 'growth' ) can be done a bunch of different ways....<br/><br/>1. current length integer * growth multiplier integer<br/><br/>hair length: 6 inches<br/>growth multiplier integer: 2 (this is a bit too high~big for a multiplier ~ see below, lol. 1.0 to 1.5 would probably be better ~ or google what is the real growth multiplier~integer of actual~real hair growth, lol)<br/><br/>6 * 2 = 12 inches as new hair length (foot long hair now!)<br/>12 * 2 = 24 inches as new hair length (2 foot long hair now!)<br/>24 * 2 = 48 inches as new hair length (we're just about getting into repunsel ~ disney princess hair 'dragging on the floor' length, lol)<br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/>2. current length integer + hair growth integer<br/><br/>hair length: 6 inches<br/>hair growth: hair length + 2<br/><br/>6+2=8<br/>8+2=10<br/>10+2=12<br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/>3. etc etc etc ways...<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>as for the triggers... there's many ways as well...<br/><br/>the easiest being just directly using a Turnscript (or Timer), and~or using another Integer Attribute that is increasing (such as a 'day' Integer Attribute, which your 'growth' uses ~ is based off of), which has a trigger (such as, again, a Turnscript or a Timer).",
