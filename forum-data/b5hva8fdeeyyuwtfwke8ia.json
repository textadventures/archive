      "EditableText": "As far as I can tell by a quick skim over the code, the game area defaults to 950 pixels wide, or the full width of the screen if that is smaller. Within that, the main text area is also 950 pixels wide, or 700 if the sidebar panes are enabled. The panes are 216 pixels wide, and are placed 255 pixels to the right of the centre line.\r\n\r\nSo, if you're just looking for an image for the margins, I suspect the easiest way to do it would be to make a large background image with a 950-pixel blank area in the middle (or a faint pattern that won't make text hard to read, if you want it to appear behind the actual game content), and ensure it's centred. This way, the same amount will be cut off the left and right sides. You can also disable the background repeating horizontally, so that people with insanely large monitors see one copy of the background, and then flat colour outside of that (and maybe have a gradient fill at the edges of the image so that it fades smoothly to the solid colour.\r\n\r\nThe CSS would look something like:\r\n```\r\nbody {\r\n  background-position: center top;\r\n  background-repeat: repeat-y;\r\n  background-attachment: fixed;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor to set it in script:\r\n```\r\nSetBackgroundImage (your filename)\r\nJS.eval(\"$('body').css({backgroundPosition: 'center top', backgroundRepeat: 'repeat-y', backgroundAttachment: 'fixed'});\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your background image is set up with hard edges that want to be aligned to the edge of the window (rather than to the edge of the game area), then you probably want to scale it instead:\r\n```\r\nSetBackgroundImage (your filename)\r\nJS.eval(\"$('body').css({backgroundRepeat: 'repeat-y', backgroundAttachment: 'fixed', backgroundSize: '100%'});\")\r\n```\r\nthat will stretch the background image to fit the width of the screen, and repeat it vertically as necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you want the image to appear once at the top of the screen it would be `backgroundRepeat: 'no-repeat'` and if you want to stretch your image to fit the window both horizontally and vertically it would be `backgroundSize: '100% 100%'`.\r\n\r\nIf your margin image has two hard edges, so it needs to be stretched to fit between the edge of the screen and the game area (or so it wants to be centred between them), you would need to create an element to contain them. I'd recommend a javascript function something like:\r\n```\r\nSetMarginImages = function (limg, rimg) {\r\n  if (limg) { ($('#leftMargin').length ? $('#leftMargin') : $('<div>', {id: 'leftMargin', style: 'z-index: -10; position: fixed; left:0px; top: 0px; height: 100%; background-repeat: repeat-y; background-size: 100%; background-position: center top;'}).appendTo('body')).css({backgroundImage: 'url(\\''+limg+'\\''});}\r\n  if (rimg) { ($('#rightMargin').length ? $('#rightMargin') : $('<div>', {id: 'rightMargin', style: 'z-index: -10; position: fixed; right: 0px; top: 0px; height: 100%; background-repeat: repeat-y; background-size: 100%; background-position: center top;'}).appendTo('body')).css({backgroundImage: 'url(\\''+rimg+'\\''});}\r\n  $(window).resize(function () {\r\n    $('#leftMargin,#rightMargin').width((window.innerWidth - $('#gameBorder').width())/2);\r\n  }).resize();\r\n};\r\n```\r\nonce that function exists in Javascript, you can call it from Quest using something like:\r\n`JS.SetMarginImages(GetFileURL(\"leftmargin.jpg\"), GetFileURL(\"rightmargin.jpg\"))`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(wow, I didn't realise I'd spent so long typing that. Hope some of it is useful to you)",
