But if I ever have an actual problem or question I know I can come here and get help.\n\nAlso you should play a couple of games if your question was what a Text Adventure actually is.  Perhaps one from the Editor's Picks or even some of the top rated ones...  \n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/\">http://textadventures.co.uk/</a><!-- m -->\n\nOf course there are other Text Adventure games out there other than on the Quest engine itself, that are tried and true which are really great also.  But the systems they were designed on is a mess of coding in my opinion.  In other words, I am saying use Quest full heartedly to design your game, but do not limit yourself to Quest only games when it comes to playing them.  Just have a look around.",
