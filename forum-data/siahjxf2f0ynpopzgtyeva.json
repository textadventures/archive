In the example the player picks 0 stats points in intelligence 0+0 = 0 hey would you look at that it gives them the top result or at least should.

Variables\r\n2. Attributes\r\n3. Parameters\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n'Variable' VARIABLES are local/temporary, they're destroyed upon their parent's scripting ending, and can't be used outside of their parent's scripting either (ERROR: 'out of scope').\r\n\r\nan example:\r\n\r\nNAME_OF_Variable = VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\n```\r\n<game name=\"example_game\">\r\n  <attr name=\"start\" type=\"script\">\r\n    msg (\"Name?\")\r\n    get input {\r\n      // quest automatically (hidden from you) stores your input into the built-in 'result' Variable: result = YOUR_INPUT\r\n      msg (\"Your name is: \" + result) // NO error\r\n      do (example_object, \"example_script\") // ERROR !!! (see below)\r\n    }\r\n  </attr>\r\n</game>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"example_object\">\r\n  <attr name=\"example_script\" type=\"script\">\r\n    msg (\"Your name is: \" + result) // ERROR !!! the 'result' Variable doesn't exist!\r\n  </attr>\r\n</object>\r\n```\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n'Attribute' VARIABLES are global/permanent (so long as its parent Object: exists / still exists), you can use them anywhere/everywhere and as much as you want.\r\n\r\nThe only negative is that changing its Value, is changing its Value, aka: the changed Value is it's new Value, and thus now that new Value is being used where-ever/when-ever you're using the Attribute\r\n\r\nan example:\r\n\r\nNAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\n```\r\n<game name=\"example_game\">\r\n  <attr name=\"example_string_attribute\" type=\"string\">unknown</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"start\" type=\"script\">\r\n    msg (\"Name?\")\r\n    get input {\r\n      // quest automatically (hidden from you) stores your input into the built-in 'result' Variable: result = YOUR_INPUT\r\n      game.example_string_attribute = result\r\n      msg (\"Your name is: \" + game.example_string_attribute) // NO error\r\n      do (example_object, \"example_script\") // NO error\r\n    }\r\n  </attr>\r\n</game>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"example_object\">\r\n  <attr name=\"example_script\" type=\"script\">\r\n    msg (\"Your name is: \" + game.example_string_attribute) // NO error\r\n  </attr>\r\n</object>\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n'Parameter' VARIABLES deals with Functions, Commands, and Objects+Script_Attributes+Delegates, basically they're a way of transferring Data (the Arguments/inputs as direct/literal Values or as VARIABLES storing the Values) to or from: Functions, Commands,  and Objects+Script_Attributes+Delegates",

I will list what I don't understand and hopefully, this forum will properly explain what my problem is so people can understand how I want it fixed. So let's get this out of the way so I don't see yet another wall of code giving me a stat system. First and foremost I understand what a stat system is. Second I understand how attributes work on a mathematical level. Now here is what I don't understand.  **((https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/4057/letting-the-player-set-attributes (this is the library I am currently using)**\r\n\r\n1. I have a stat system in place FANTASTIC, I have strength, luck,  and intelligence these are the three attributes I currently have in the test game I've made to test out the code. So here was the issue with what someone suggested, I simply didn't understand how either of the options would help me in my situation. So, currently, the player can change all the three attributes to 10. I can level the player up whenever I need it be. Here's where the issue lies, how would I get the system to recognize when the value is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10? because the player can already manually input it to 10, but the system doesn't do anything with that number. I already have max points in place so the player doesn't just shove 10 points into each stat and go on with their day. So how can I get the system to recognize what the player put in while keeping in the maxpoints? ((**I apologize if this question was already answered**))\r\n\r\n2.  is it possible to do what I just described? is this too complicated for quest to handle? am I  misunderstanding the posts in the past forums? Now that I have made clear what I want the system to do this is the results I want from the system recognizing these values **1. for intelligence to be able to change the alias of objects((and no the player cannot become these objects)), 2. for the objects I want the player to be able to look at said objects so that the descriptions match up with the aliases. For example:  If intelligence = 1  apple.alias = \"different name\" look at script: if intelligence = 1 print message: it's a different name) ** \r\n3. if this becomes too headache inducing I will just give up on trying to work with these values because in my main game I already have a system set-up for objects connected to a phantom value and it's really complex and it works for me, and I was honestly hoping this attribute system would be a far more convenient method of doing things. All that it has done is lead me to more headaches and confusion. I am just really frustrated because I am left with more questions than answers. So, if I sound angry it's not towards anyone in the past post. All these intertwining paths that just make me, even more, confused. \r\n(if anyone has any further questions or things that don't make sense to them that I mentioned please pm me)\r\n\r\n",

So, currently, the player can change all the three attributes to 10. I can level the player up whenever I need it be. Here's where the issue lies, how would I get the system to recognize when the value is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10? because the player can already manually input it to 10, but the system doesn't do anything with that number. I already have max points in place so the player doesn't just shove 10 points into each stat and go on with their day. So how can I get the system to recognize what the player put in while keeping in the maxpoints? ((<strong>I apologize if this question was already answered</strong>))</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>is it possible to do what I just described? is this too complicated for quest to handle? am I  misunderstanding the posts in the past forums? Now that I have made clear what I want the system to do this is the results I want from the system recognizing these values **1. for intelligence to be able to change the alias of objects((and no the player cannot become these objects)), 2. for the objects I want the player to be able to look at said objects so that the descriptions match up with the aliases. For example:  If intelligence = 1  apple.alias = \"different name\" look at script: if intelligence = 1 print message: it's a different name) **</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if this becomes too headache inducing I will just give up on trying to work with these values because in my main game I already have a system set-up for objects connected to a phantom value and it's really complex and it works for me, and I was honestly hoping this attribute system would be a far more convenient method of doing things. All that it has done is lead me to more headaches and confusion. I am just really frustrated because I am left with more questions than answers. So, if I sound angry it's not towards anyone in the past post. All these intertwining paths that just make me, even more, confused.<br>\n(if anyone has any further questions or things that don't make sense to them that I mentioned please pm me)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n",
