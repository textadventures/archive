      "EditableText": "Hmm… you mean you want to suppress the \"You are in a [whatever]\" line when a room is dark?\r\n\r\nIf it's one specific room, you could use the room's \"before enter\" and \"on enter\" scripts to turn that line on or off.\r\nSo before entering the room, you could have:\r\n```\r\nif (CheckDarkness ()) {\r\n   game.autodescription_youarein = 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand after the room is entered, you could have:\r\n```\r\ngame.autodescription_youarein = 1\r\n```\r\nto turn it back on for the next room.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do this for all rooms, I think the simplest way would be to change the player's `changedparent` script attribute. You could modify the default script, and at the  beginning just add:\r\n```\r\nif (CheckDarkness ()) {\r\n   game.autodescription_youarein = 0\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n   game.autodescription_youarein = 1\r\n}\r\n```",
