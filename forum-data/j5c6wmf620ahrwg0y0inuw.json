      "EditableText": "`SetFontSize` only changes the font size of any future lines output by `msg`. It doesn't affect text outside of the main output.\r\n\r\nIf you want to format text in the listalias, you can use text processor commands; but there isn't one for font size. So the easiest way is to use HTML.\r\n\r\nI think you want:\r\n```\r\nobject.listalias = object.listalias + \"<small>(equipped)</small>\"\r\n```\r\nYou could also do:\r\n```\r\nobject.listalias = object.listalias + \"<span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt\\\">(equipped)</span>\"\r\n```\r\n**but** you don't know the user's display resolution or size. Using measurements like `mm`, `in`, or `cm` means that text that's a sensible size for someone playing on phone would be unreadably small on a large monitor. On the other hand, using pixel measurements (`px`) will make your text smaller on a higher resolution display. It's usually recommended to use percentages; `85%` would make the text smaller than the rest of the line, but not by much.\r\n\r\nIf you want your game to be playable on different devices and different screen sizes (especially if you want it to work for people with impaired vision, who might have turned up the default font size on their computer), it's better to  stick to percentages.\r\n\r\n(I am aware that Quest itself is badly designed for accessibility; but still better to develop good habits so that your game doesn't suddenly become ugly if this is ever fixed)",
