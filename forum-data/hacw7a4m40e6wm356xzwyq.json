I want to start off with the player making a decision of gender based on the armor they choose for their character which is presented to them in the first page of the game and images are provided for each set. \r\n\r\nOnce the player has picked a set of armor, I would like to transition to the same page regardless of which option they pick e.g Option A and B take you to Page 2. That way it saves me from having to duplicate the next page. Is it possible or would it just be easier to duplicate the page and then move to the same page?\r\n",
