When you edit the 'use...' details of the object that you can use on another object, did you add an object under the 'Objects that (object) can be used on:'. If so, is the name of the object typed properly?",

The problem is that it's not reading the item that i'm using it on because the message is &quot;you can't see that here.&quot; But the item is definatley in the room i checked that like 5 times. And i can even use a verb on the item so its in there to some extent. It's very wierd. The script is that it ends the game and shows a picture window. That works on the verb but not on use the item on it. I think it might be a bug. Prolly not though since there is alot I don't know yet. Just need to consider it.",
