That's all fine and dandy with the exception of these two context clues that appear in room descriptions; 'You can go (north, south etc.)' and 'You can see (objects in the room)'. I can change these in the interface easily enough, but I reckon I must be glossing over however I change the wording of these two. \n\nCan anyone point me in the right direction?",
