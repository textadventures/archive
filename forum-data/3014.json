      "EditableText": "Ok, so I am back into making the Text Game and I want, lets say a soldier, who is already in the room, to be able to be asked questions.  I tried using the tutorial and searching both in the tutorial webpages as well as this forum and I can not find my answer.  I am assuming the answer is simple, but it is beyond me.  Can some one hold my hand please and explain what I have to do to make this work?\n\n  In the tutorial it says I have to make an &quot;If&quot; command for &quot;alive&quot;.  (That was for Bob, because originally he was dead.)  But my soldier is not dead nor ever will be dead, at least not for right now.  Regardless, I typed &quot;alive&quot; just to check and also used [&quot;If&quot; &quot;object is visible&quot; &quot;object&quot; &quot;soldier&quot;] and also [&quot;If&quot; &quot;player is in room&quot; &quot;object&quot; &quot;soldier&quot;], but that does not work either.  It says to &quot;Add&quot; random subjects, so I put &quot;age&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;name&quot; etc., but when I say &quot;ask soldier name&quot; or &quot;ask name&quot; it says &quot;I don't understand your command.&quot; or when &quot;soldier&quot; is highlighted on the 'Places and Objects Screen&quot; to the right of the game &quot;speak to&quot; is available, but when I click it it just says &quot;She says nothing&quot;.  (I made the soldier a female.)\n\n  Is there commands or verbs I was suppose to create before hand to all this or is the &quot;ask/tell&quot; suppose to be so simple I am missing something?  I even tried to use just &quot;print message&quot; since I did not want any kind of restraint to begin with, but nothing.  Also I have played some games where if you click on the NPC the available questions are there to be clicked.  How do I make those?  Thank you.",
