I created an object called drawer, but upon playing the game, the drawer shows up as a clickable link, giving it the appearance of being as standalone drawer. I just want the desk and drawer to be connected, allowing the player to open the desk drawer(resulting in description of items in drawer), and close the drawer(stating that desk drawer is closed). Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
