I want to share with you an upcoming game Odysseus Kosmos and his Robot Quest.\r\n\r\nTrailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vqBMYKS1bU&t\r\n\r\nIt’s a traditional 2D point’n'click game with retro-pixel style graphics. It’s an adventure game, a game with heart, about space ship’s engineer Odysseus Kosmos and his service robot Barton Quest.\r\n\r\nThe pilot episode is already available on Steam for free (pilot episode is really shorter than any of the future five full episodes, yet it delivers a small independent story). https://image.prntscr.com/image/aur9uNlOQFuZjfQ_pbUFDQ.png\r\n\r\nSteam page: http://store.steampowered.com/app/645820",
