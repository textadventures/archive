It would be really helpful if there was a search facility..  assuming there isn't already.\r\n\r\nFinally, I find it helps a lot to collapse the tree view and only expand the few locations that I am working on at a particular time.  Could we have a 'Collapse All' button and/or have the collapsed / expanded states of each node be stored and then restored when Quest  is re-opened?\r\n\r\nI know there is work on a new version so this is probably not likely to be acted on but it is taking longer and longer to make progress as I spend so much time searching for things in Quest.\r\n\r\nSimon",
