Stretching a small book into three long movies just left a lot of padding, which the director seems to have decided to fill with characters who weren't even in the Hobbit (hello Legolas, Saruman and Galadriel). Lots of really overlong battle scenes didn't help and the over the top fights were just cringe-worthy. Seriously, did Legolas really jump off the side of a 60 foot tower, break his fall by stabbing his sword into the head of a troll, then use said sword to steer said troll into said tower and topple it over a ravine, thus making a pretty effective bridge? I'm sure he can't have done because that would have been goddamn ridiculous, but that's what I saw. \n\nPersonally I'd have sooner had a single film which stuck more to Tolkien's book and left the CGI fight scenes for other films.",

I liked LoTR and felt it worked well as three movies, but then LoTR is a huge book anyway. The Hobbit isn't. Stretching a small book into three long movies just left a lot of padding, which the director seems to have decided to fill with characters who weren't even in the Hobbit (hello Legolas, Saruman and Galadriel). Lots of really overlong battle scenes didn't help and the over the top fights were just cringe-worthy. Seriously, did Legolas really jump off the side of a 60 foot tower, break his fall by stabbing his sword into the head of a troll, then use said sword to steer said troll into said tower and topple it over a ravine, thus making a pretty effective bridge?

I'm the sort of person who should like comics but they were a bit meh. I might persevere because as much as I love reading books I find every new story a chore to get into. I've got loads of Stephen King to get through at the moment. Mainly books of short stories.<br/><br/>Film wise I'm going to watch Live and Let Die today. It's easily the best Bond film with voodoo and witchcraft - if you can overlook the overt racism that goes hand in hand with pretty much every film from that era. I'll be watching it on a projector too although projected onto a wall rather than a screen. I need a room to be built specifically for these purposes, but that'll come later.",

It's been a while since I read any Marvel or DC stuff.  Like you said, today it's all mega-events and reboots to give the appearance of change, when it's really just shaking things up, waiting for them to settle, putting it back the way it was, repeat forever.  I guess that's what sells today, but I just find it tedious.\n\nOf course, there's a whole world of comics beyond superheroes.  I might not have a weekly pull list at the local comic shop anymore, but I find the good stuff.\n\n[quote:1dfc2em8]Speaking of superhero movies though, the ones everyone keeps yelling at me to see are First Class and Days of Future Past. I disliked the third X-Men movie so much I kind of stopped paying attention to the series for awhile. Have you seen those and how good are they?[/quote:1dfc2em8]\n\nX-Men 3 never happened.  It was a mass hallucination foisted upon us by aliens, or possibly malevolent spirits from a dimension parallel to ours.  (Can you tell I grew up on comics? <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: --> )\n\nFirst Class and DoFP are both good.  I would disagree with anyone who says they are great.  I think because so much time elapsed after X2 without an X-Men movie that was anything above mediocre, people got all over excited and overrated them.  But they are both enjoyable and worth watching.  I like First Class better of the two, only because I think DoFP was trying too hard to &quot;fix&quot; the franchise instead of just delivering the best possible movie, and it suffered from too many characters syndrome.",

It's been a while since I read any Marvel or DC stuff.  Like you said, today it's all mega-events and reboots to give the appearance of change, when it's really just shaking things up, waiting for them to settle, putting it back the way it was, repeat forever.  I guess that's what sells today, but I just find it tedious.<br/><br/>Of course, there's a whole world of comics beyond superheroes.  I might not have a weekly pull list at the local comic shop anymore, but I find the good stuff.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Speaking of superhero movies though, the ones everyone keeps yelling at me to see are First Class and Days of Future Past.

But they are both enjoyable and worth watching.  I like First Class better of the two, only because I think DoFP was trying too hard to &quot;fix&quot; the franchise instead of just delivering the best possible movie, and it suffered from too many characters syndrome.",
