The ability to collapse sections and passages helps to keep your work organized.\r\n\r\nSo what if you could select a bunch of sections/passages to collapse into a chapter?\r\n\r\nIf any of you have used Inform, you know what I am talking about. It's just another simple organizational tool.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can choose only to display one specific chapter or all of the chapters together.\r\n\r\nIf anything, I want to ensure that the online Squiffy editor is back up and running before this feature request even gets considered. We all love Squiffy and await its happy return!\r\n\r\n-Broadwaydude",
