In a matter of hours, your whole world is turned upside down as you and your brother are dragged away from your home in Greece to work as slaves in the Roman Empire. Now you must struggle for survival. Every decision you make will affect your future. Your life, the life of your brother and the lives of your friends are in your hands.\r\n\r\nBegin your journey as a child, and make heartbreaking choices that will shape the adult you will become. But be careful. An act of kindness might come back to haunt you, and a thoughtless word could earn you some powerful enemies. A split second decision will determine who lives and who dies. Will you sell your soul to win your freedom, or sacrifice everything for the people you love? Will you even live long enough to see the sun rise?\r\n\r\nhttp://chooseyourstory.com/story/the-price-of-freedom~3a-innocence-lost\r\n\r\n(Hi guys, I'm new here. Been writing IF for awhile now but only just found this site. It looks pretty cool. Still trying to figure out how everything works, but hopefully I'll get there in the end. Anyways, please let me know what you think of the game and if you notice any mistakes at all. I'm working on the sequel right now, so any ideas or advice you might have for that would also be really appreciated. Thanks.) ^_^\r\n",
