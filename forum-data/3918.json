(Alex has uploaded it manually for me once.)\n\nI would like to try and reduce the size of it so I can upload on my own.  It has images and sounds, which I guess is why it is big.  Is there a way to see what is taking up so much space?  Can I delete a saved image in the game?  What is the upload size limit?\n\nThanks for any help.",
