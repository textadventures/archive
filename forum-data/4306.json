Bear with me while I explain. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nThere are different page types in Gamebook mode. You can see this under the &quot;Page type&quot; dropdown for a page. The normal page type is &quot;Text&quot;. This page only has text. There are also two others of interest: &quot;Script&quot; and &quot;Script + Text&quot;. The latter will run a script and then dump out the text like a normal page. The former is a page that only has a script to run. What use is this? Well, it can be used to do some scripty things and then move you off to another page. It's just a transition page with no text of its own.\n\nSo, as somewhat painful as it might seem, create three intermediate pages (e.g. Page1_1, Page1_2 and Page1_3). For each, set the type to &quot;Script&quot;. Then add script to set the variables you want (or whatever else). Be sure the last script command on each page is a &quot;Move player to page&quot; command, with page being your Page 2. The script will be run, and the player will then be taken to Page 2.\n\nNote that I haven't tried the above, but looking at the Quest core, it looks like this is the way to do it. If that doesn't work, we'll try again. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
