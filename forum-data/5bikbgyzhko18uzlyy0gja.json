Previously, when my room description has just displayed a message, these have nicely auto-populated. Unfortunately, as this room's description is a script, it has obstinately refused any attempts to print out all the nice in-room-descriptions for objects._\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease excuse the absolutely noob question, I'm sure there's an easy way around it, but after Googling around hopelessly for an hour my object descriptions remain unprinted. After playing around with the foreach script and a bunch of settings, I've been stuck. Thanks a bunch to whomever helps.\r\n\r\nSide-note: This is my first game and I'm only about 20 hours in, and my first time posting on the forum! Hi everyone! Quest is rad and I am in love with it. As a non-coder who has been playing INFOCOM games for the last few years, embarking on this quest to create my own has been absolutely rad. I can't wait to learn enough to be a helpful person on this forum rather than just someone flailing around searching on it.",
