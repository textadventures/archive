I want to use them for the creation of my own game, and I've found small pieces taken from the cartridge code, but nothing comprehensive.\n\nI need to know the formulas for damage calculation, experience gain, probabillity of encounters, money for winning, etc. The whole system that runs the game. Thanks to anyone who can help me out.",
