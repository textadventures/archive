Once the 2 minutes is up, the place explodes and the player loses.\r\n\r\nMy question is...\r\nHow do I do the following (if it's even possible)\r\n1.) Print a message every 10 seconds saying how much time is left.\r\n2.) Create a 2 minute counter that the player can watch tick down. So far my best guess is an animated gif with 1 second intervals.\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\nThanks!\r\nDelorian",
