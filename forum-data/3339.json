I managed to get a question/menu up and running at the start of the game that asks the player to choose a gender, but not sure if I could use that value or how I could use it for specific dialogue depending on the question/menu selection.",

So, if the player chooses male, the game sets a flag on the object &quot;player&quot; called &quot;male.&quot; Else if they choose female, the flag is called &quot;female&quot;\nThen, whenever you want a gender-unique event, set up an &quot;If...&quot; script. For example, this script for speaking to Bobert:\n\n[code:doxsa9db]      &lt;speak type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n        if (GetBoolean(player, &quot;male&quot;)) {\n          msg (&quot;\\&quot;Hey, bro!\\&quot; Bobert says, man-hugging you&#46;&quot;)\n        }\n        else if (GetBoolean(player, &quot;female&quot;)) {\n          msg (&quot;\\&quot;Oh, hi!\\&quot; Bobert says, giving you a hug&#46;&quot;)\n        }\n      &lt;/speak&gt;[/code:doxsa9db]\n\nOr in the GUI:\n[img:doxsa9db]http&#58;//i325&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/k367/182crazyking/MFSCRIPT&#46;jpg[/img:doxsa9db]",

For eg if I move from one location to another I sometimes add a second delay just to give it some realism in the game. However I don't know how to transfer that to the walkthrough.
