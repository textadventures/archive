I used the search function in forum and wiki, but didn't get much result or was a little wary of information about older quest versions.\nI want to give the various exits my own description, and not just have them simply listed after the room description without explanation. I want something like this: &quot;You are in a courtyard, in the north you can see a pathway to a lake and in the south lies the road towards the town.&quot; Preferable with hyperlinks at north and south.\nI discovered the scenery checkbox and it hides the exits and the exits list, but then they don't apprear in the compass panel. Can I hide/switch off the exits list, but still have the compass buttons for the exits?",
