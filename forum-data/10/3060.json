I tried modifying the room description code to use ObjectLink on the room name. I then added the look verb to my room:\n\n&lt;displayverbs type=&quot;list&quot;&gt;[look]&lt;/displayverbs&gt;\n\nI get a link but when I click it, where it should say look, I see garbled text like: \n^look$|^l$\n\nAnd of course, the command fails. Ideas? For an ipad/iphone game, I want to disable the command line so having a look/refresh button would be important.",

      "EditableText": "don't need an inventory button as there's a pane for that. Don't need a save button as the game auto saves. Shouldn't need a help button - could easily have a help npc you interact with in the starter area, or have help &quot;books&quot; in a players inventory when they start the game that they can &quot;read&quot; anywhere. But look is a bigger issue. Even a small amount of scroll in the room makes the description go away with no way to easily get it back. I was even wondering about a static pane at the top of the main window that doesn't scroll and always shows the current room's description (including exits)",
