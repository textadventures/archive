      "EditableText": "Hi!  I am trying to get a text adventure to run a 3-second Youtube video.  \r\n\r\nThe main problems are:  It takes so long to load up a Youtube video that by the time it does, my game has moved on to the clear screen and other actions I coded.  (The 3-second video is supposed to just show the result of a player's command before the game triggers another event.)\r\n\r\nI don't want to show the previews of other videos on my Youtube channel at the end.  (The game should just clear screen and move on after the 3-second clip).  Maybe I just need a way to shave off the ending of video, or to pause it.  But it needs to auto-play and it needs enough time to load so that it's viewable at all, before the next event in my game.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I would make a loop that repeats the 3-second video, giving time for the video to load, in hopes that the player would be able to watch the 3-second clip before the next event fires.\r\n\r\nI tried studying the main page on Youtube videos (\"Adding Videos\"), https://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/adding_videos.html, but I don't really understand where to put the JAVA script options that are listed under the section \"Adjusting the Width of the Video.\"  I don't need to adjust width, I just need to play the clip again in a loop, giving time for Quest to load the embedded Youtube screen and show it, before moving on.\r\n\r\nI already copy-pasted in the \"SetLastIframeID\" coding  (do I even need that?) into a new Function.  But when I call the function in my game, do I put in the Youtube ID # in that call line, like this:  \r\n\r\nSetLastIframeID (\"JuYE34wkLSi\")\r\n\r\n...I just made up a random sequence of # for that example, but that is where I'm guessing I put my youtube ID#.  Or, am I supposed to do the call function like this:  SetLastIframeID (\"my-video\").\r\n\r\nAnd where do I put the Java Script for playing the video again?  I mean, where exactly in my game do I place that line of JS ?  It doesn't do anything when I put it right where it needs to be in the sequence of code, where events are firing.  I.e., do I just throw in a line of JS right in the midst of Quest code like normal?  I don't use JS normally, so I don't know.\r\n",

I'll try to remember and come back to fix this later; or anyone with a decent grasp on Quest can probably finish it off:\r\n```\r\n$(function () {\r\n  $.getScript(\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\", function () {\r\n    var player;\r\n    insertYouTubeVideo = function (id) {\r\n      if (player) {\r\n        addTextAndScroll ($('#youtubeplayer'));\r\n        player.loadVideoById(id);\r\n      } else {\r\n        AddYouTube (id);\r\n        player = new YT.Player($('iframe').last().attr('id', 'youtubeplayer')[0], {events: {\r\n          'onStateChange': function (event) {\r\n            if (event.data == YT.PlayerState.ENDED) {\r\n              endWait();\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }});\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```",
