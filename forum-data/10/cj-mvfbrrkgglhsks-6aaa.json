Anyways I never got the link to any games like that and so I'm starting to wander if a game like that is even possible, I myself gave up on my idea for a trade game because the code for it was above my skill level, so if anyone knows of a game like the one i'm looking for please share the links to them here! Thanks in advance! ",
