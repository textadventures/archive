It doesn't appear in the Quest Help file, nor does it seem to be a feature of the GUI.\n\nI'm asking because research in game design has revealed that many IF fans enjoy if not demand Undo functionality.  Rather than having to systematically save a game in case of a needed reload, a player can undo the effects of the last command.  In some cases they can undo indefinitely.\n\nNow I realize that RPG-type games do not need undo functionality, since it renders their probabilistic systems useless.  But in games that do not employ random processes to determine outcomes, the undo command is very handy indeed.",
