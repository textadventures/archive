I'm kind of old school as far as my VERY limited coding skills go, so I like to declare my variables on the very first page of the game, 'Page1' (It doesn't have to be called that, it could be called \"START\" or anything you like).  To me, Quest seems very forgiving, in that it never complains or throws errors no matter *where* I foolishly declare the variables.\r\n\r\nSo for a game like an RPG, I recommend declaring the variables (attributes) early.  You do this by making your start page (the page with the 'player' object under it) able to run scripts.  Change the 'type' of the page from 'Text' to 'Script' or 'Script + Text'.  I recommend just 'Script' type because it's simple and non-interactive with the player.  Now just click on the 'add script' button.  There are several different categories, 'Output', 'Pages', 'Scripts', 'Variables' and 'Effects'.  The one you want is under 'Variables'.  It's called 'Set a variable or attribute'.\r\n\r\nWhen you click that, it inserts the script as a line into the GUI, and the cursor is blinking in the field where you enter the name of the variable.  Here is where you have to remember to attache the variable to a game object, like 'player' or 'game'.  But don't worry, it's easy!  Just type \"player.\" (no quotes and keep the period) and the name of the variable, say, \"player.strength\".  When we read this, we say, \"Player dot strength\".  You could also attach it to the game object: ```game.strength```, but that could get confusing.\r\n\r\nAfter the 'expression' drop-down (ignore this for now), there's another field where you actually set the value.  In this field, you can set the variable to a value of your choice.  If every game starts off with a strength of 12, then jut type, \"12\".  If you want to generate a random number, type \"GetRandomInt(#,#)\" and replace the number symbols with a low end of the range before the comma and the high end after the comma.  Say you want to simulate rolling three six-sided dice, you would type:\r\n```\r\nGetRandomInt(1,6) + GetRandomInt(1,6) + GetRandomInt(1,6)\r\n```\r\nIt's that easy!  And remember, do NOT put scripts under the 'game' object, unless you want them to run EVERY time the player makes a move.  Actually, they run every time the 'player' object is moved, but ignore that fact for now.",
