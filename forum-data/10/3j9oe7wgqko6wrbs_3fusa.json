I tried doing a gamebook but when I was looking for advice on coding (which I know nothing about, most of my knowledge of it comes from copy and pasting examples), it said that gamebooks aren't very good and it's better to make it a text adventure. So I tried that but I just can't get the hang of it, the linking between pages seems too complex and I can't find a way to only display \"left\" or \"right\" to go to \"next page\" and \"previous page\".\r\n\r\nSo what's the best thing for me to do? Or should I use a different program altogether?",
