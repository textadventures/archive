      "EditableText": "I am trying to create several objects (characters) that the player will come across in multiple rooms during the game. For instance, Richard speaks to Clarence (and his guard) in room one and room three. When Richard sees Clarence the second time, they will interact differently - the player will have different questions for Clarence, and Clarence will answer those new questions. How can I do this? Regardless of whether I set the parent object as &quot;none&quot; or a particular room, I get a message that &quot;an element called Clarence already exists in this game.&quot; Any suggestions would be very useful, as this is going to be an insurmountable problem if I can't find a way to do this.\nThanks, Diane",

I only know this message if you try to create an object with the name of an existing object. The name must be unique in the game, so you could create Clarence2, Clarence3... and set the alias of every object to Clarence.\n\nAs sgreig said it would be the best to have one object and move it to the spezific rooms (but I don't think its necessary to check the objects room; just move it).",
