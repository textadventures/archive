In the meantime, I'm going to work on a horror/mystery game. It takes place in a mansion (don't they all) and I want mobs to walk around freely. Is there any way to do this without TOO too much work, or am I going to have to settle for a bunch of lethargic NPC's? \n\nBTW, here's a good idea... maybe someone can work on it or would want to co-op with it... A NetQuest murder mystery game where a certain number of players work against each other to solve a mystery. Maybe it could even be where one of the players has to kill an NPC and the others must figure out which one of them did it. Of course, I need to figure out how to use NetQuest first... I only just started using Quest itself...",

I haven't played it. It's a mystery? Sounds strange for a Zelda game. If I can figure it out, I might turn this single-player game i'm working on into a multiplayer and just see who can solve the mystery first. If someone collects a clue first, you would have to interact with the other players to find it out, and might wind up working together against the others. I think it sounds cool, but that's just me.\n\nAnd sorry... It is QuestNet.",
