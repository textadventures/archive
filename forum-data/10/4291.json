But you can't do &quot;myList[3] = someValue&quot;.\n\nQuest also uses the bracket notation for template strings [ATemplate], so that probably explains your error message, if you used it in an &quot;unacceptable&quot; way.\n\nDictionaries correspond to maps in other languages (aka &quot;associative arrays&quot;). The key must be a string, but if you create a generic dictionary (use NewDictionary instead of something like NewStringDictionary), then you can assign any type to a value. The drawback to dictionaries in Quest is that you can't set a value if the value has already been set - you must remove it first, which can be a real pain in some cases.\n\nI have a C++ background as well, but Quest feels more like JavaScript, in that you don't define classes and all that. You just have objects with attributes, and attributes can even change type through the life of the program, morphing to the value you assign to them.

      "EditableText": "You have the right idea about why it's not working. Some things in Quest are passed by reference (objects, lists, dictionaries, etc) and the rest are passed by value. If you call:\n\n[code:1b8svd4n]dmg(player&#46;heath, value)[/code:1b8svd4n]\nthen the dmg function gets as its parameter the *value* of player.health as a local variable. If you add onto that, it just changes the local variable, not the original. The easiest way to work around this is to have it be in-and-out:\n\n[code:1b8svd4n]player&#46;health = dmg(player&#46;health, value)[/code:1b8svd4n]\n\nwhere dmg has the right return type and :\n\n[code:1b8svd4n]return (stat-value)[/code:1b8svd4n]\nSince objects are passed by reference, you can do it a different way:\n\n[code:1b8svd4n]&lt;function name=&quot;dmg&quot; parameters=&quot;object,field,value&quot;&gt;\n    stat = GetAttribute(object, field)\n    set(object, field, stat-value)\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:1b8svd4n]\nThen you would call it with:\n\n[code:1b8svd4n]dmg(player, &quot;health&quot;, value)[/code:1b8svd4n]\n\nHope that helps!",
