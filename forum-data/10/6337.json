(Sorry for the run-on)\n\nI haven't tried this at all yet, I wanted to see if it was possible first. The order wouldn't need to make logical sense e.g. go north from bedroom to bathroom, then go north from bathroom to bedroom would be ok.",

When a player does something that opens another exit, simply run the script 'make exit visible'.",
