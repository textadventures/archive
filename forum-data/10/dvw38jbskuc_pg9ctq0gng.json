      "EditableText": "I have a couple questions about Quest's auto-mapping feature.\r\n\r\n1.  My game starts with some rooms that are hooked together properly with exits and some that are floating in space.  I'm using CreateBiExits to bolt on the floating rooms as needed.  When the player thereafter moves into the new room, the map is not auto-generating a square for the new room.   I've read the discussions here -- https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/mfqxdcktmu2oevrn-qdg-q/creating-exits-to-rooms-that-dont-exist-yet -- and here -- https://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/showing_a_map.html -- but am not getting anywhere.  Is there an easy way to do this, or should I just fall back to the method of creating all the exits, hiding them, and then making them visible as needed?\r\n\r\n2.  A smaller issue is the map labels for each room are appearing just outside the top border of each square rather than inside the square.  This the same whether I use script to set  <code>.grid_label</code> or fill in the Label field under the Map GUI.  Am I overlooking something?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!",
