I mean I can't call this a request, it's just I think it could help to improve Quest and make it more enjoyable, so people may be more interested in it.\nI'm using Inform / Glulx, it's very powerfull but it's such a pain to program, especially when the game is growing very big that it's the reason why I'm looking for Quest now. I like the IDE, and the fact that, unlike Adrift for ex., it generates instead of binaries a script that can be edited by hand.\nI've looked for some of those features in the help files, but so far I haven't found them, but forgive me if they are and I haven't managed to get them myself.\n\n- like in most inform / tads interpreter, to be able to redo last command with up arrow on keyboard\n\n- default game open / save / load etc. is \"My documents\". Last folder used could be better for those who store games and save games elsewhere.\n\n- The inclusion of sound is good and perfect it seems. It's good also to have a display window. But to be able to add images inside the text window (like in inform / glux, Hugo or Tads) could be very great and opens new possibilities. \n\n- possibility to start a game with only the text window (no inventory, places and objects, and compass windows). It could give a more \"old IF game\" looking / feeling. I used this for a game I'm designing with Inform, and the player can get the icons with a \"Icons on\" command, if he / she wishes.\n\n- is it possible to easily create a text based menu only ? (instead of pop up)\n\n- possibility to use in the script of a game the ldf definition so the game will load with the correct langage support.\nex : define game &lt;&gt;\n\tlangage &lt;francais&gt;\n\n- hope new version of Quest won't require new translation of the ldf file, but will be add ons for the language.\n\n\n\n\tEric",
