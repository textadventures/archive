      "EditableText": "Yes, you can change the alias of the exit to whatever you want.\r\nThe only difficulty will be with the web editor, which for some reason doesn't let you enter a new alias. So if you're editing online, you would need to use a script at the start of the game to change the alias.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your exit's name is `exit113`, you could add a line to the start script:\r\n```\r\nexit113.alias = \"kitchen\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, exits have a name that is just `exit` and a number. To find out what it is, you would have to use the function `GetExitByName` (for example `GetExitByName (hallway, \"north\")` which returns the name of an exit from its current alias. But usually it will be easier just to give the exit a name in the editor.",
