I have seen the clock library, but don't know how to use it or don't really want to use it.\r\n\r\nI have been asking a lot of questions here, I'm just getting hooked onto quest that's all.",

      "EditableText": "I'd suggest having an attribute `game.time` that tracks the current time as a single number. 0 could be morning day 1, 1 would be afternoon day 1, 3 would be midnight, and 4 would be the morning of day 2. Then any command or event that involves time passing can do `game.time = game.time + 1` or similar.\r\n\r\nYou can access the separate parts using a changescript. For example, create a script attribute `game.changedtime` (this will run automatically whenever a script changes `game.time`). You could have it do something like:\r\n```\r\ngame.day = game.time / 4 + 1\r\ngame.timeofday = ListItem (Split (\"morning;afternoon;night;midnight\"), game.time % 4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that `game.timeofday` and `game.day` will change automatically when `game.time` is changed; so you can look at those whenever a script needs to know what time it is.",
