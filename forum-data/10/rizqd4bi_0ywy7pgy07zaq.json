      "EditableText": "well, you got the first step right:\r\n\r\nunderstanding that the 'ask/Ask' Function/Script is a 'yes/no' type of question, and not a normal open-ended question (use the 'show menu' or 'ShowMenu' for normal open-ended questions)\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n'ask/Ask' provides the person/user/player with the selection of 'yes/no', however, in the actual code, the selection is (automatically: hidden from you) stored within the 'result' Variable VARIABLE as 'false/true'\r\n\r\nif you select the 'yes' choice/option: result = true // the 'true' Boolean Value is stored into the 'result' Variable VARIABLE\r\nif you select the 'no' choice/option: result = false // the 'false' Boolean Value is stored into the 'result' Variable VARIABLE\r\n\r\nso, within the 'ask/Ask' Script/Function, you need an 'if' Script, to handle the conditional (result = true / result = false), so you can have two different responses/actions, based on whether the person/user/player chose 'no' or 'yes'\r\n\r\nas in-code scripting, it's long form (NOT efficient: does extra operations that it doesn't need to do, as quest has been programmed to understand a shortened form allowing it to skip those extra operations) looks like this, an example\r\n\r\n```\r\nask (\"Do you want to keep playing?\") {\r\n\r\n  // quest automatically (hidden from you) stores your choice, as 'true/false' within the built-in 'result' Variable VARIABLE:\r\n  //\r\n  // if chose 'yes', then: result = true\r\n  // or\r\n  // if chose 'no', then: result = false\r\n\r\n  if (result = true) {\r\n    msg (\"You chose to keep playing\")\r\n  } else if (result = false) {\r\n    msg (\"You chose to quit\")\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nconceptually, how the use of the 'if' Script/Function above (in this case/usage/scenerio/example) works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// result = true\r\n\r\nif (result = true) {\r\n// if ( [result = true] = true) {\r\n// if [ [true] = true) {\r\n// (yes, 'true' = 'true') -> TRUE\r\n// if (TRUE), then do its nested script below\r\n  msg (\"You chose to keep playing\")\r\n} else if (result = false) {\r\n  msg (\"You chose to quit\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n// output:\r\n\r\nYou chose to keep playing\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n// result = false\r\n\r\nif (result = true) {\r\n// if ( [result = false] = true) {\r\n// if [ [false] = true) {\r\n// (no, 'false' is NOT = to 'true') -> FALSE\r\n// if (FALSE), skip its nested script below, and jump to the next code/script line instead\r\n  msg (\"You chose to keep playing\")\r\n} else if (result = false) {\r\n// else if ( [ result = false] = false) {\r\n// else if ( [false] = false) {\r\n// (yes, 'false' = 'false') -> TRUE\r\n// if (TRUE), then do its nested script line below\r\n  msg (\"You chose to quit\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n// output:\r\n\r\nYou chose to quit\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nnow, quest is programmed to understand a shortened form with Boolean (false/true) usage, along with using 'else' for a binary/opposite conditional choice/option, both of which, are more efficient code-wise: less operations that it has to do/perform):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (BOOLEAN) {\r\n// if (BOOLEAN = true) {\r\n  // WHATEVER scripting\r\n} else {\r\n// if (BOOLEAN = false) {\r\n  // WHATEVER scripting\r\n}\r\n\r\n// or (reversing it, via using Negation: the 'not' logic operator)\r\n\r\nif (not BOOLEAN) {\r\n// if (not true)\r\n// if (BOOLEAN = false) {\r\n  // WHATEVER scripting\r\n} else {\r\n// if (true)\r\n// if (BOOLEAN = true) {\r\n  // WHATEVER scripting\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nso, here's the shortened form of the example in this post:\r\n\r\nthis IS the type of form/pattern/syntax that you want to do (though you'd need to adjust it for your own application within your game, as this is just an example)\r\n\r\nand the next section below this section, shows how to do this example through the GUI/Editor, as you probably aren't a coder yet, wink\r\n\r\n```\r\nask (\"Do you want to keep playing?\") {\r\n\r\n  if (result) {\r\n    msg (\"You chose to keep playing\")\r\n  } else {\r\n    msg (\"You chose to quit\")\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n// or:\r\n\r\nask (\"Do you want to keep playing?\") {\r\n\r\n  if (not result) {\r\n    msg (\"You chose to quit\")\r\n  } else {\r\n    msg (\"You chose to keep playing\")\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nso, to do the 'if' Script in the GUI/Editor for within the 'ask/Ask' Function/Script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwithin the 'ask/Ask' Function/Script:\r\n\r\n[run as a script] -> add new script -> 'script' section/category -> 'if' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nif [EXPRESSION] result\r\n\r\n-> then -> add new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"You chose to keep playing\"\r\n\r\nelse\r\n\r\n-> add new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"You chose to quit\"\r\n\r\n// ---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n// or:\r\n\r\nwithin the 'ask/Ask' Function/Script:\r\n\r\n[run as a script] -> add new script -> 'script' section/category -> 'if' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nif [EXPRESSION] not result\r\n\r\n-> then -> add new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"You chose to quit\"\r\n\r\nelse\r\n\r\n-> then -> add new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"You chose keep playing\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nlastly, about the 'ask' vs 'Ask' Scripts/Functions:\r\n\r\nany built-in Script/Function that has lower-case and upper-case versions:\r\n\r\nthe lower-case version does the pop-up window menu selection\r\n\r\nthe upper-case version does the in-line (the blue hyperlink text) menu selection\r\n\r\n'ask' vs 'Ask'\r\n\r\n'show menu' vs 'ShowMenu'\r\n\r\nand probably more that I can't think of right now",
