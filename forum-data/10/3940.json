I've tried all sorts to make it just say the original bit but for whatever reason it insists on putting 'Object:' before it. \n\nI am now contemplating the idea of having seperate objects to switch between when equipping which I really don't want to do because it's twice as much work. Can anyone help stop it from putting that weird 'Object:' bit in there?\n\nThanks a lot in advance.\n\nEDIT: I can't remember what I did differently but at one point I was getting &quot;False (equiped)&quot; instead of &quot;Object: handgun (equipped)&quot;.",
