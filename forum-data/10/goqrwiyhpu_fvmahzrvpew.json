I don't want to remove the other name because the player is likely to interact with the object using the word \"brandy\".\r\n\r\nClearly the game is running a partial match, that's why interacting using the word \"bran\" pulls both \"bran\" and \"brandy\".\r\n\r\nLooking in the docs (https://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/important_attributes.html) under \"**The alt attribute**\" heading it says \"_Quest will match bits of names_\", and clearly this is hurting, not helping, in this situation!\r\n\r\nAnyone know if I can stop Quest doing partial matches on a particular object, or perhaps how to introduce a \"brandy\" NOT \"bran\" boolean thingy?",
