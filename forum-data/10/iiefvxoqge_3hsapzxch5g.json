For example, if the question is \"How are you doing?\" the script would look for a phrase that included \"good, great, okay, fine, happy\" or \"bad, meh, sad, tired\" and ignore text before or after the key words, then send out a response according to the key words. I would have a few basic responses set up if the player did not use one of the key words that would be \"I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that phrase.\" Or something. Not trying to pass a Turing test, just trying to get the program to accept player input with \"I'm feeling good\" or \"I'm okay\" or \"great\" and send out the same answer of \"Glad to hear it!\" based off of the key words.\r\n\r\nThe way I am doing that in Quest, but not doing it very well, is limiting dialogue trees to rooms and hidden objects, then creating objects that are words like \"good\" that have 'other names' and a list of 'verbs' that are possible phrases the player could type.
