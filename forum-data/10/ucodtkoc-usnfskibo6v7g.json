I'm not native English speaker so apologies for any typo's and grammar mistakes ;)\r\n\r\nFor use in education we are giving students the option to interview Jackie Kennedy after the assasination of John F. Kennedy. I have searched the forums and tutorials and I just can't tackle my problem.\r\n\r\nThe game: http://play3.textadventures.co.uk/Play.aspx?id=kzg2_p7nqecdlxczwjkevq\r\n\r\nIt features only  1 room with an object (Jackie), whom de students can ask questions regarding te assasination. These questions are now set as 'commands'. For example:\r\n\r\n**\"From which direction did the shots come?\" which uses the regular expression \"which direction\" as an activator.**\r\n\r\nThis results in an Typewriter message; \"I don’t know where the shots came from. I think maybe from behind the car. I don’t know where the shooter was.\"\r\n\r\n**Because most students are still learning English, there is a chance that they don't know or use the word 'which'.\r\nI would like to use the terms \"direction shots\" but that only works if these terms are adjacent to eachother. I tried an * in between but that doesn't seem to work.**\r\n\r\nAnyone know/see what I am doing wrong (or should be doing here)?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nEelco",
