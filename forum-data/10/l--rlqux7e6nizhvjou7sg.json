      "EditableText": "Okay, so, I have an idea I want to execute on, but I can't wrap my head around how. For my game, I'm looking to have both a player's current health and their maximum health fluctuate throughout the game. Changing these values is fairly simple. What is complex, however, is getting them to appear in the same status attribute. For example, I want a status attribute that looks something like this:\r\n\r\nHealth: 100/100\r\n\r\nWhere both numbers are editable. So far, I can only seem to figure out how to get one editable attribute per line in the status menu. Does anyone know how to get two attributes within a single status attribute?",
