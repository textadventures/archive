      "EditableText": "So, a player recently played Xanadu 2 and, through no fault of his own, managed to get stuck at the very end of the game and couldn't progress.  It's a hidden bug-a-boo that I am working on figuring out.\r\n\r\nAnyway, he shared his save file with me.  It is a .quest file.  I get an error message when trying to open it.  I played the game to the point where he was stuck and returned a save file (.quest) to him.  By the way, I have played the last 5% of the game after sending him the save file and it finished correctly without issue.\r\n\r\nMy anticipation is this... since I had an error opening his save file on my system, will he have the same problem opening mine?  And is there a workaround to this issue?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",
