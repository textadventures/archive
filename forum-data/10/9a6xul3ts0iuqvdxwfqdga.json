      "EditableText": "Hello. I have been working on a chess- and platformer-based quest game for 7 years, which is currently called Chess Quest. It wasn't until recently that I continued working on the game. Now let's start on the question...\r\n\r\nI have set up a room where playable chess pieces are capturing opposing chess pieces. However, this room does not look like a regular chess board; instead it resembles that of a normal video/computer game, especially that of a 2D platformer game with characters and chess pieces. The problem is that I am not sure how to make it function like an actual chess game (with levels more complex than those of chessboards).\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me how to make the players move like chess pieces? Thanks for reading.",
