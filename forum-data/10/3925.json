What I am trying to do, however, is hyperlink certain &quot;options&quot; to let the player make various choices. I tried creating objects and hyperlinking them to do this, but it isn't working out how I want.\n\nWhat I want is to have something hyperlinked and that run a variety of scripts when clicked upon. For example, if the character is asked if he wants a cup of coffee or not, I want to have the options to &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;decline&quot;. Then, if &quot;accepted&quot;, it prints a bit about it being given to him and then his tiredness is decreased an X amount. I know this is a shoddy example, but I can't really go into detail since I have no idea how it can be done and what it'd really look like implemented.\n\nCan this be done using commands? I know you can hyperlink commands but I don't really know how to use those yet, what purpose they serve, or what the use of hyperlinking them is.",

      "EditableText": "Hyperlinked commands sound like exactly what you want. They create hyperlinks which, when clicked, will execute a command script. Here is an example (in code):\n\n[code:2f4skhak]  &lt;command name=&quot;AcceptCommand&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;pattern&gt;accept&lt;/pattern&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;\n      msg (&quot;You take the coffee and now feel more alert&#46;&quot;)\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/command&gt;\n  &lt;command name=&quot;DeclineCommand&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;pattern&gt;decline&lt;/pattern&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;\n      msg (&quot;You sniff at the coffee, but it's not what you're in the mood for at the moment&#46;&quot;)\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/command&gt;[/code:2f4skhak]\nThis defines two commands, one for &quot;accept&quot; and one for &quot;decline&quot;. The pattern defines the text you need to pass in your hyperlinked command. You can then print out a menu like this:\n\n[code:2f4skhak]      msg (&quot;{command&#58;accept&#58;Accept the coffee}&quot;)\n      msg (&quot;{command&#58;decline&#58;Decline the coffee}&quot;)[/code:2f4skhak]\n\n&quot;command:&quot; is a text processor command. The first part between the colons is the text executed, as if the player had typed it in. This should match the pattern of a command. (You can even execute built-in Quest commands and verbs this way.) The last part is the text to show. \n\nNote that you can create commands on a per-room basis. So if you're simulating a game book by moving from room to room, then the commands defined in each room will only be active when you're actually in the room.\n\nI also have some code I could pass along which is a single &quot;DoScript&quot; command, which executes named scripts on named objects, with parameters. But that might be a bit more than what you need. Let me know (anyone) if that would be useful.",
