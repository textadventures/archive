      "EditableText": "OK; \"before enter room\" will run after the player moves into the room, but before displaying the room description. However, the room description will still show even if the player is dead; once the script is started, it keeps on going.\r\n\r\nThere are two obvious ways to do this:\r\n\r\n1. **Exit script**\r\n\r\nPut a script on the exit that leads into the room. This script runs *instead of* moving the player, so you could make it something like:\r\n```\r\nif (Got (some object)) {\r\n  player.parent = this.to\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"Rocks fall, you die.\")\r\n  player.health = 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis means that if they don't have the item, they die without actually entering the room.\r\n\r\n2. **Using the room's \"before enter\" script**\r\n\r\nYou've tried this already. But the script runs *before* the player enters the room; after it runs, the player will continue entering the room even if they're dead.\r\n\r\nSo there's 2 things you can do. In both cases, your script needs to do something else immediately after (or before) killing the player.\r\nThe most obvious is to move the player out of the room again, so that the description doesn't display. You could move them to a room whose name is \"dead\" and prefix is \"You are\". So instead of \"You are in [room name]\", it says \"You are dead\". And because the dead room has no description, no objects, and no exits, nothing else is displayed. A lot of people make use of this, and the main downside is that it will run the \"on exit\" script for the room they never really entered.\r\n\r\nOr, you can simply turn off room descriptions after the player dies, by adding the line:\r\n```\r\ngame.showdescriptiononenter = false\r\n```\r\nThis flag hides room descriptions until the player uses the \"look\" command; which they can't do because they're dead.",
