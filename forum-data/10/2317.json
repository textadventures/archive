When the player types &quot;step on tile,&quot; what should happen is a door stops being on fire and allows passage to another room. I thought I could replace &quot;door on fire&quot; with a normal &quot;front door&quot; and have the direction unlocked, but I can't seem to accomplish this. I don't want the player to still see the &quot;door on fire,&quot; because it wouldn't be on fire anymore. \n\nI have the object &quot;tile,&quot; which is in another room, a &quot;door on fire,&quot; and a &quot;front door.&quot;\n \nAny help is appreciated.",
