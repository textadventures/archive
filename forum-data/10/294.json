      "EditableText": "Sometimes I have this problem with scripts: I'll create some object, let's say a \"table\".  I'll give it a script whenever examined it makes an object on it accessible.  I'll make another object in another room, let's say an \"apple\".  I'll go to where I can add scripting for when you examine this object, but for some strange reason it will have the script I created for \"table\".  So I'll remove it and type in the scripting for the \"apple\".  I'll go back and check the scripting on the \"table\" and it has been erased and replaced with the \"apple\" script.\n    To make better sense, I'll simplify what I described.  Sometimes when I edit scripting on an object, it seems to be linked to the scripting of another object and changes that objects script to match the one for the first object.  I've found ways to fix this, but it's way too tedious.  Does anyone know what's wrong and how to fix this problem?  Thanks.",
