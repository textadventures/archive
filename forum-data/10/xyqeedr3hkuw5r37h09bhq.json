      "EditableText": "_Is there a way to get the page numbers on the left to sort into page order? I have 5 pages. Since pages 2 and 3 were different reactions to the same situation, I decided to rename \"page2\" to \"page2A\", and \"page3\" to \"page 2B\". Then when I added page 3 again as a new page, it wound up at the bottom of the page list, after page 5. (page1, page2A, page2B, page4, page5, page3) When I try to drag and drop it, it ends up being a sub-page of one of the other pages. Is there a way to fix this without having to go through and manually rename all the pages so they're in order again?_\r\n\r\n_Thanks in advance!_\r\n\r\n**UPDATE: I figured it out. If I \"close\" the page list so that only ' + Pages ' shows, it opens an Objects list in the right pane, and I can move the pages around there. I needed to save, close, and reopen the book again for the changes to show in the list on the left. =D**",
