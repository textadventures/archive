Instead of making your Gamebook using the Gamebook mode, you could use the Text Adventure mode. Turn off command bar, map, inventory and anything you dont need. By doing this you can set the game to describe certain objects and show their hyperlinks, so \"Cats\" will appear in blue and underlined. When \"On take\", you may set to another word or phrase or effect appears.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the player knows what word may be clicked, there is a set of things you need doing. You could keep the command bar in the game, does not show objects in description and let the player use the \"take\" or \"look at\" command to get the same effect. If the player supposes there is something hidden in the word \"Cats\", the player types \"Look at cats\" and the additional content shows up.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a Gamebook using the Text Adventure mode for some particular reasons, but I found it is specially good when comes to programming by GUI, because it offers more coding options.\r\n\r\nI hope it helped.",
