      "EditableText": "The text processor (which is responsible for handling stuff in `{`/`}`)  only looks at the first dot in a name, so it will be trying to find an attribute named `pov.alias` on the `game` object. This is a weird issue in the text processor.\r\n\r\nYou can work around this by using the text processor _Eval function, which treats all the characters inside it as a Quest expression. So you could write `{=game.pov.alias}` and `game.pov.alias` will be treated as a Quest expression. (You can also use `{=` to call the _Eval function if you want do maths or call functions; so you could do something like `{=game.pov.strength * 2}` or `{=GetDisplayNameLink(game.pov, \"object\")}`. It allows your text to include arbitrary bits of script, as long as they return a value.",
