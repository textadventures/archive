I submitted the description and now I could not edit my game anymore. \nI keep getting this message:\n'Sorry, an error occurred while processing your request. &quot; \n\nCould you check what is going on, if the problem is the text... The game is the same that worked before, I did not uploaded anything new, just the text. I kind of like my &quot;game number&quot; (it is 666 - lucky uh?) and don't want to loose it.\n\nThanks,\nAlex.",
