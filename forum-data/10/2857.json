I presume to create another variable [b:2ulajhoy]game.answer[/b:2ulajhoy] in the Game attributes as well.\n\nLet's say a combination lock needs a 4 number code.  When the command is ENTER CODE and I set the variable [b:2ulajhoy]game.answer[/b:2ulajhoy] as an user input (GetInput). So on RUN,  Looking at the Debugger when a number is inputted in the Game attributes will be two numbers for [b:2ulajhoy]randnum[/b:2ulajhoy] (as expected) and [b:2ulajhoy]answer[/b:2ulajhoy] (the number inputted) - so far so good.\n\nNow this is the point I don't understand.  I've tried an IF command but not sure what the &lt;expression&gt; is. \nI've tried [b:2ulajhoy]game.answer = game.randnum[/b:2ulajhoy] but get an INT32 and STRING error.\nEven [b:2ulajhoy]game.randnum - game.answer = null[/b:2ulajhoy] doesn't work.\n\nThere needs to be a guide in the Wiki Quest to explain fully how to create, compare and mathematically change number variables because I'm lost. \n\nIt was so much easier with Quest 4!",
