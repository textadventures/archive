Each menu, through a SWITCH command, takes you into through script (for example, mission log). However, at the end of that, you can press any key to go back. So I want it to take you back to the previous script (to the point after the simulated login when the menu is presented). I was trying to see if there was a way to \"bookmark\" that menu and then just reference the bookmark. Can anyone assist?",

      "EditableText": "I wanted to make something similar for my game. What I did was use different script attributes attached to the computer object, and the ```invoke (script)``` or ```do (object, scriptattribute)``` commands.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a primary ```computer.menuscript``` script that gets called when the computer is used. This script generates the basic menu of options for what the player can do at the computer. Selecting one of the options will invoke a different script attribute (```computer.emailscript```, ```computer.browseinternetscript```, etc.) \r\n\r\nWhen I want the player to return to the main menu, it's then just a matter of invoking the main ```computer.menuscript``` again. If you have turnscripts, you should be sure to pepper in a couple ```SuppressTurnscripts``` and ```RunTurnScripts``` as-needed to make sure each individual invocation doesn't advance the turn order, but this kind of system is working out well for me so far.\r\n\r\nHope that helps",
