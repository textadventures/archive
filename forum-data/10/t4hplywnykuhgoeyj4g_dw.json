I am working a very simple program via Quest to be used in an Escape Room that I am building.  I have written the code fine so far, everything works as I need to, and I have even figured out how to hide the Location bar and Panels to the right (woo!).  \r\n\r\nI need this program to be as \"idiot\" proof as possible.  As such, is there any way to hide the toolbar at the top from players?  The less players have access to, the less of a headache for my staff and I.  They do not need access to the File, Edit, View, Tools, or Help commands whatsoever for my purposes.  I have scoured the forums but cannot seem to find a solution to this, if there is one at all.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your help!",
