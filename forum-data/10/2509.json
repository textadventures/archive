If I type 'switch on oven' while the oven is already on, it still says: you switch on the oven. How can I change this into p.e.: the oven is already on? And how can I set the oven off when I start the game?\nI'm sorry if this question is already answered, but I couldn't find it and I hope you can help me with some sort of step by step explanation. <!-- s:oops: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /><!-- s:oops: -->",

It works perfectly!!\nFor my next question: I want to make a cabinet which I can open and close which reveals a key when you open it and hides it when the cabinet is closed.
