Thus a blue gem weighs 7 units.\n\nPlacing an orange gem + weight 3 on one side of the scales and weights 2 &amp; 5 on the other balanced. Thus an orange gem weighs 4 units. (7-3).\n\nPlacing a green gem + weight 2 on one side of the scales and weights 3 &amp; 5 on the other balanced. Thus a green gem weighs 6 units (8-2).\n\nSo recipe 1 needs 2 blue, 3 orange and 1 green gem, while recipe 2 needs 1 blue, 2 orange and 3 gems.\n\nDoes anyone know of any more puzzles like this?",
