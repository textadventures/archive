This ruins huge chunks of the game, from spoiling puzzles (one boss is defeated by kissing him, a weakness you can figure out from clues in the area but I don't want to flat-out tell people you can do it) to affecting a moral choice near the end of the game (it's possible to use violence on a character, but I want the player to have to independently decide to &quot;fight&quot;, &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;attack&quot; her without having it suggested to them) to making the spell system not make sense (players can see the option to use spells they haven't learned about in-game yet--a playtester mentioning this to me was how I learned about this).   Is there some way to turn this feature off without turning off panes entirely?  It's so convenient for the player to have that stuff there, but if there's no other way I'll be forced to do away with them.",
