I don't know if this is an issue with stacking my ifs, or if I don't understand how random chance works.  \r\n\r\nBasically there are a series of choices that you have made up to this point that change what happens to you when you move rooms, depending on what combination of events you've done. In this situation there is an element of chance involved. So, what I'm hoping is that each combination of events would be treated as a hundred percent. For example: You stole an item, didn't call the police, or call your friend. This results in a 25% chance you end the game, a 30% chance you are attacked and  a 45% chance you are fine. BUT if you stole an item, didn't call the police but DID call your friend there is only a 10% chance that you'll be attacked and 90% chance you'll be fine. It seems to only be running the first if script no matter what combination of events have happened.\r\n```\r\nget input {\r\n  if (result = \"wake up\") {\r\n    msg (\"You wake up.\")\r\n    DisableTimer (wake up)\r\n    if (not GetBoolean(phone, \"policecalled\") and Got (almond fudge ice cream) and not GetBoolean (phone, \"TJwork\")) {\r\n      if (RandomChance(25)) {\r\n        finish\r\n        msg (\"hospital\")\r\n        MakeObjectInvisible (almond fudge ice cream)\r\n      }\r\n      else if (RandomChance(30)) {\r\n        msg (\"tattoo.\")\r\n        SetObjectFlagOn (player, \"heart\")\r\n        EnableTimer (heart)\r\n        MoveObject (player, Underground Shopping)\r\n        MakeObjectInvisible (almond fudge ice cream)\r\n      }\r\n      else if (RandomChance(45)) {\r\n        msg (\"bla bla description.\")\r\n        MoveObject (player, Underground Shopping)\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    else if (GetBoolean(almond fudge ice cream, \"icecreamstolen\") and not GetBoolean(phone, \"policecalled\") and not GetBoolean(phone, \"TJwork\")) {\r\n      if (RandomChance(80)) {\r\n        msg (\"tattoo\")\r\n        SetObjectFlagOn (player, \"heart\")\r\n        EnableTimer (heart)\r\n        SetObjectFlagOn (player, \"tattoopain\")\r\n        MoveObject (player, Underground Shopping)\r\n      }\r\n      else if (GetBoolean(phone, \"TJwork\") and GetBoolean(almond fudge ice cream, \"icecreamstolen\") not GetBoolean(phone, \"policecalled\") ) {\r\n        if (RandomChance(10)) {\r\n          msg (\"tattoo. \")\r\n          SetObjectFlagOn (player, \"heart\")\r\n          EnableTimer (heart)\r\n          MoveObject (player, Sketchy Room)\r\n          MakeObjectInvisible (almond fudge ice cream)\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n          msg (\"bla bla description.\")\r\n          MoveObject (player, Sketchy Room)\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      else if (GetBoolean(phone, \"TJwork\")) {\r\n        msg (\"bla bla description.\")\r\n        MoveObject (player, Sketchy Room)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      msg (\"bla bla desciption.\")\r\n      MoveObject (player, Underground Shopping)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"Where are you?
