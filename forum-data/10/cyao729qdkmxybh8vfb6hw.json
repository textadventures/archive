I have no experience of programming. \r\n\r\nI have is a bookcase. When you examine the bookcase you see an interesting looking book. This is what happens:\r\n\r\n> examine bookcase\r\nMost of the books are missing or damaged but one catches your eye. It is a red book that sticks out further than any other book on the shelf.\r\n\r\n> examine book\r\nPlease choose which 'book' you mean:\r\n1: bookcase\r\n2: red book\r\n\r\nI want it to just examine the book not give me a choice of everything with the word book in it. Is there a way to do this?\r\n\r\nAnother example of this problem would be when I have objects in a room with similar names to group them together and find them easily in the object list.. For example:\r\n\r\nShed\r\nShed key\r\nShed door\r\n\r\nIf I say open shed it will present me with a choice to open all of these, including the shed key, which I would obviously not want to open. Is there anyway to exclude this object from the command? In this example I could of course give them different names, but it is useful to have similar names so that items in the same room are grouped together, and with the book and the bookcase there really isn't another name I could give them.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance.\r\n",
