I've got the spelling right because it displays the alias to room 2, but it's just the name, just not a link. In the text processor when I click the Exit Link button on the right, a window pops up asking me to insert the exit name. There appears to be a drop-down list which I assume should show me all available exits, but it is empty. The exit to room 2 from room 1 is one way only. The hyperlinks option in Display is selected.\r\n\r\nAny pointers?",
