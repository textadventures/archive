It's kind of simple. Make a few string lists with the choices as the strings, and in the start script, show the first list, after choosing the second/third/fourth list, then the fifth/sixth...\nWhen the player enconters a choice where they pick up something, move the item to the player. Althrough this way is a little difficult and timetaking. I suggest you make inventory-less gamebook games.",
