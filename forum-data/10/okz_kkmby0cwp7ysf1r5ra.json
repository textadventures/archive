In the game I'm working on there's an object called an \"Apron\", this apron is a wearable and contains a knife. When the object is lying in the room, you can take it and open it to get the knife, but if the player wears the apron before opening it, it's no longer available as an option. Is there a way to fix this or get around this issue?",

If it is worn, it will show `wornverbs` plus \"Look at\" and \"Remove\".\r\n\r\nNote that these do not have any effect on whether a command will work; the player can always type \"open apron\" anyway, it just doesn't appear on the list of displayed verbs.\r\n\r\nThese lists appear on an object's \"Wearable\" tab, under the title \"Additional display verbs (separate with semi-colons)\".
