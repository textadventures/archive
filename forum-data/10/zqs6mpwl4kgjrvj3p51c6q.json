It doesn't even fully cover the top of the screen, though; you can see slivers of words that have been pushed up that far underneath it to the left, as show here.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/bdc4998a32ade8d224aa836cbae3d427.png\r\n\r\nNow, on the right of my screen with all the status stuff, I have some prime real estate going just under the compass. Would it be possible to resize the map window to be roughly the same size as the compass, perhaps a little bigger, and then move it down into that bar?\r\n\r\nThank you for any responses.\r\n\r\n",
