      "EditableText": "Two questions:\n\n1. How can I set up a room that is the hub. In it you can set controls to go to another room. There are X rooms available, but everytime I show the 'control' menu, I only want it to show Y options, where Y is a random subset of X (say 4 out  of 10)? Plus if you've been to room Z before, it stops it being allowed in future selections? \n\n2. When I go to a room, M random objects appear out of a selection of N objects (where again M is less than N). And how do I stop an object being selected twice and therefore getting less than M objects appearing?\n\nI hope I've explained it clearly enough...\n\nThanks in advance",
