One evening, you recieve a call from an anonymous source, suggesting that you look into rumours of cult rituals at an old mansion in the country, and giving an address.  Although there is no contract, your passion for your career gets the better of you, and you set out the next morning to investigate.<br/><br/>You arrive at the tall, dark mansion and park your car just inside the gate.  You head down along a leaf littered path, surrounded by trees, to arrive at the large front door.  There is no knocker, but you find that the door gives way with a push.
