Music loops fine when I play the game offline, however online (when uploaded to textadventures.co.uk), music does not loop. On top of that, I get a weird error whenever I start the game that says &quot;Error running script&#058; An item with the same key has already been added.&quot; Anyone have any idea why? I might have missed something.\n\nRegarding the music issue, I have no idea why it would do that online, especially considering I ticked it to loop, and it loops just fine offline. What could be the issue?\n\nThe only files I could upload, sadly, was my project file. Doesn't let me add anything else that goes over 256 kbs. Hope this alone helps.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nS0ul\n\nEDIT: Here's the online version of the game: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.textadventures.co.uk/review/878/\">http://www.textadventures.co.uk/review/878/</a><!-- m -->  As you can see, music does not loop.",
