And maybe the game will change because of that, say for the fighting if you choose to be x then you have a better chance to hit the monster(ie not miss) but each hit doesn't do as much etc.\n\nNow weapons.  I suggest you get Al's library and use the container.  Make an object for your player and make it be a container.  Then, make your weapons and give each a special property with their stats and make the weapon be able to be put in a container.  Then, you can pick up weapons and use them.",
