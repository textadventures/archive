I came up with some dirty ways to do it, but they all caused bugs elsewhere in the game that were directly related to what I did trying to disable the commands.\n\nSo is there a much easier and cleaner way to disable a command? I want the code for disabling it to be at the end of the script that is activated when the command is first used.\n\nTherefore, the command works the first time, but when the player tries to use the command again, the game does not respond to the command - especially without an error. If a message could be displayed when the player tries to use it more than once, that would be even better than nothing happening at all.\n\nTo be more specific, I want to implement a skip command. So that the player can skip large dialogue, scene, or story setups if they choose to. This would move them to a specific room, but I don't want them to be able to use the command again, because it would return them to that room - probably breaking the game in the process.",
