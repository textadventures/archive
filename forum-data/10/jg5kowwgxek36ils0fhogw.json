I tried to look this up in the documentation but I'm not even sure what the proper term is for something like this. \r\n\r\nFor example, from the tutorial, I learned that I could use a backslash to use quotation marks within a string. I think this might be called an \"escape\" character based on my experience with similar stuff in other applications. Or another example is how you can use \"!\" to represent a number in the label for a turn counter. \r\n\r\nRight now I'm mainly trying to figure out how to do line breaks, but if someone could point me to a list of these (and what to call them) I'd appreciate it.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm using the GUI editor right now, so if the syntax is different depending on whether you're using the GUI editor or not, that might be important to point out. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJustin",
