I was clicking through the keys too fast or something because I had made all the qualifications and was still there, and clicking through the keys fast is all I can see that I was possibly doing wrong. Then, finally, I waited for a second instead of continuing, and it said I was the new pov, so I was in the random region, but first it displayed the error message. I changed the script to make it a little bit easier to get out of the room, but I still don't know what I can do about the error or where it is. I think it was my key speed.",
