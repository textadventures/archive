      "EditableText": "Basically what the title says, I'm wondering if there's an easy way to set \"scenery\" to \"true\" for rooms like you can for objects. Related to the \"room management\" thread but that post is closed and didn't have what I was looking for. \r\n\r\nBasically I nest rooms within rooms because it's easier from an organizational standpoint. Like I might have\r\n\r\n1. Crossroads\r\n1a. Dirt path\r\n2. Town Gate\r\n2a. Town Square\r\n2b. Residential \r\n2b1. Players home\r\n2b2. NPC home\r\n\r\nThe same way you might make an outline for a school paper. The problem is, when I get to room \"Town Entrance\", it says that I can see a \"Town square\" and a \"Resedential\" in the room, along with any signs or regular objects I might put near the town gate. Which, yea, technically they are contained within the town, but I don't want it listing the name of every room contained within the \"Town Gate\". \r\n\r\nI know for objects there is an option to mark as scenery so it is not displayed in the room's description. And since rooms and objects are technically the same according to the tutorial,  I figured there must be a way to set that same \"scenery\" option to the rooms themselves, so I wouldn't see everything within the town listed as soon as I got to the main gate. \r\n\r\nIm coming from RPG Maker logic so it makes much more sense to me to stack rooms inside rooms for organization, then connect the exits yourself.\r\n\r\nSomething like;\r\nRegion 1\r\n-Town A\r\n     -Town A Shop\r\n-Town B\r\n     -Town B Shop\r\nRegion2\r\n -Mountain A\r\n        -Mountain A cave\r\n -Mountain B\r\n\r\n..etc\r\nAnyways let me know if there's a script/ method to set the scenery option for rooms to \"true\"",
