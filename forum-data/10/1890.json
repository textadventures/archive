Do the same for mana. (This should've been obvious)\nNext make the three spell objects. Call then whatever you want. Edit the 'use on anything' script. Make an 'if', comparing two variables, do '%mana%' greater than or equal to the mana you need to cast this spell. In the 'then' part make another 'if', if object has property, object is '#quest.use.object.name#' (this is a string set automagically by quest), property is 'badguy' or 'monster', whatever you want to call it.\nNow edit the then part of the 'if'. Have it take away from the mana the ammount you want, next choose the 'set a numeric variable', name 'monsterhp' or whatever, and have it set to '#(quest.use.object.name):hitpoints#', this means the object's 'hitpoints' property. Next take away from the variable what you want. Then set the object's property to the new value (%monsterhp%).\nNext check if it's dead (%monsterhp% = 0), destory the object, give gold or whatever, print a message saying it died, etc... Make sure to remove the object from the room at least.\nnow go back to the second 'if' set up, edit the 'else'. just print a message with 'you can't cast a spell on that' or whatever.\n\nThe first 'if's 'else' should print a message like 'you don't have enough mana.'\n\nDo that for all your spell objects!\n\nNext edit the afterturn script, have it do a 'for each object in (room)', set the room to '#quest.currentroom#' then do that propecty check for the badguy or monster property like before. The 'then' should take away from their health and print a message saying '(name) attacks you.' You can get the name with #(quest.thing):alias# if you set up an alias on that object.\n\nNow make a badguy or monster object, name it what you will, make sure it has properties 'badguy' or whatever you called it, and hitpoints, equal to how many hitpoints you want it to have.\n\nThat should do it. If you have any more questions, just ask, but try to give as much detail with the problem or what you want help to do, or we can't help you.",
