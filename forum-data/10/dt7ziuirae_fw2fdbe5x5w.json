I know what I generally want each path to be like, but I need help on how to make it work with this program. One major problem is character selection. How do I work that into a text-adventure game? I want the player to be able to choose what character to play as at the start (considering that they would be able to choose from main protagonists and antagonists).  Also, I want to make the score the progress that the player has made with whomever they pursue. Is there a way to make a \"progress score\" for each individual character? Or, if not that, is there a way I could make it impossible to pursue a character and then pursue another? If anyone could help out that would be great and I thank you in advance. Also, if there are spelling and/or grammar errors, please excuse that my laptop doesn't have the best spellcheck.",

Do you want your dating sim to be mostly a pure CYOA (choose your own adventure: you get a selection of choices, which branch into various combinations of paths) or do you want it to be a CYOA but have more RPG aspects to it or do you want it to be a RPG (I'm not quite familiar with what types of games are dating sims, I don't know much about dating sim games, lol)? Etc etc etc information/questions that I can't think of at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe reason, is that the Game Book version is a very stripped-down / limited in functionality, whereas the (offline/desktop) quest text adventure is the full program/functionality.
