      "EditableText": "Hello again. Got a question about verbs, now I know how to use verbs and display verbs in inventory versus displaying room verbs but how do I display custom made verbs ONLY in inventory or room. Example: I have a Item that I want room verb only to display \"Take\" where as Inventory verbs I want to display \"Equip\", \"Examine\" and \"Combine\". \r\nSo I can use the \"Examine\" since its built in as the \"Look\" verb, but what about the custom ones I have script for, how do I add the verb to the item with its own custom script?\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced\r\nMike ",
