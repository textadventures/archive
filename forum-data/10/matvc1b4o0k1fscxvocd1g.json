      "EditableText": "Hello, I'm currently trying to make a CYOA style game using the Gamebook. However I'm unsure on how to create variables in the game (since I use the online editor I  have a slight idea for text adventures but Gamebook lacks a key thing I need for it to work). I'm also unsure the main function of the the counter as well, I can't seem to find it in the tutorial, or if it is something I can use.\r\n\r\nSorry for sounding like a novice, I can handle text adventures but the gamebook looks weird. Yet I think its perhaps the best to go about the CYOA rather than creating a whole world that may only be seen once in some cases.\r\n\r\nEdit: Didn't realize there was also Squiffy, and it has a tutorial on gamebooks, I'll poke through that and see if I still have the same issues.",

      "EditableText": "> However I'm unsure on how to create variables in the game\r\n\r\nI suspect you mean attributes; which are variables that continue to  exist after the end of the script that created them.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to do it in the GUI (it's awkward, and you have to find the option you want instead of just typing it in). However, if you can't find the function you need, you can still enter code view for a moment, type it in, and then return to the GUI if that's your preferred way of working.\r\n\r\nTo set an attribute, you want a line that looks like:\r\n```\r\nobjectname.attributename = value\r\n```\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\ngame.score = 25\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nplayer.catchphrase = \"By George!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn gamebook mode, the \"objects\" you can use for your attributes are either the special objects (`player` and `game`), or pages. Note that you have to spell the name of the object exactly, including any spaces and capital letters.\r\n\r\nIf you want to increase or decrease an attribute, you can do sums using the old value (or using other attributes). For example:\r\n```\r\nplayer.health = player.health - 6\r\n```\r\nwill set the `player`'s `health` attribute to what it previously was, minus 6. This will cause an error if you haven't already set that attribute to something.\r\n\r\nTo display the attributes, you can include `{objectname.attributename}` in any piece of text that gets displayed. To change other things based on the value of an attribute, in your script you can do something like:\r\n```\r\nif (player.health < 20) {\r\n  msg (\"You are bleeding, so your friend panics and takes you to hospital.\")\r\n  MovePlayer (page95)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully that's enough of the basics of variables. If you can be more precise about what part you're missing, I can try to give a better answer.\r\n\r\n> I'm also unsure the main function of the the counter as well, I can't seem to find it in the tutorial, or if it is something I can use.\r\n\r\nA counter is just an attribute of the object `game`. Gamebook mode gives you some functions to manipulate them. The same as Flags, which are just attributes of `game` which must be boolean (`true` or `false`).",
