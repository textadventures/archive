The tutorial on the wiki doesn't work and I've seen a couple of posts on the forums that deal with this but the solutions there don't seem to work for me either.  I'm using Quest 5.4.1 and I thought that adding a basic stylesheet would be easy but that doesn't appear to be the case.  Please help.\n\n-- Jokes",

      "EditableText": "Thank you for your reply, Pixie.  The injecting html in that wiki was the first thing I tried.  But apparently the insert command doesn't work in 5.4 so that was a no go. The initUserInterface method does look promising but is also not a solution currently as you said (and the documentation isn't exactly thorough either).  And I'm not really sure javascript is what I want either but I guess it could work.\n\nSince I'm writing a game book I just have a collection of pages and it would be really nice to just make div tags with the classes I want and then alter them with a global css sheet.  Is there really no way to do this??",
