I have figured out that you use Script - Function - Picture &amp; Sound - Show a Picture.\n\nIn the image location, I have moved the pictures into an image file inside the game folder. So how would you write the location path? /images/picture name.jpg? Or do you need to reference the complete path?\n\nAlso how is it accessed, is it a object that you create? Is it a menu option or part of the room script? \n\nThank you ahead of time.",
