I just created a tiny sample gamebook game and even though it says it will give me the .quest file, I found I had to upload it and agree to allow it to be used for free before it would create and allow me to download it as a .quest file.  And now I have downloaded the file and don't really know how to get the .quest file to run.  I double click on it and it says no application set to open this file and there are none in the app store.  Maybe I just don't know how to run the file from my browser.  On a Mac and using Chrome.  Appreciate any help.",

If you right click the .quest file, you should get options on setting the correct file to open your .quest file.  Right?",

I think I've tried this once before long ago, and no, I probably do not have the quest software app on my Mac (since I'm sure this Mac is newer than the last time I used Quest).  So that is probably it.  If I wanted to sell my little adventure games, though, that would mean anyone who wanted to buy it would also have to install the Quest software?  I thought that was not the case but things may have changed.  Again, thank you!  It is appreciated.",
