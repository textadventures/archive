      "EditableText": "One way to do this that would probably be simpler for your players is actually to have the verb require just one object, but then have a script that checks whether the player has something to dig with.\n\nSo if there is a &quot;shovel&quot; object and you want the player to be able to &quot;dig ground&quot;, then in the dig ground script just check whether the player has the shovel.\n\nAlternatively if you do want the player to be able to &quot;dig ground with shovel&quot; then you need to create a command instead of a verb. You can read about commands in chapter 11 of the tutorial (page 30). You probably want a command template like &quot;dig #@object# with #@digger#&quot;, then in your script check whether #digger# is a sensible object to be digging with (maybe give your shovels and spades a &quot;dig&quot; property), then run the appropriate script (you could make it totally generic by giving your objects which can be &quot;dug&quot; an action - not worth it unless you're going to be digging in more than one place though).",
