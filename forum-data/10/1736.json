      "EditableText": "I've read a few posts here about people wanting to specify how things are worn on various parts of the body.  I've tried an approach and am curious as to what you think.\r\n\r\nI've only been using Quest for about a week or so, and my total amount of time dabbling is probably 15 hours, but I have found a way using properties to build body slots, so that you can test to see if a particular kind of item already is present for a given part of the body.  I had seen the suggestion about using rooms to do that, but something about that technique somehow seemed less than stellar so I sought to try something else.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have an object called playerslots with properties of head, neck, torso, etc., and then an object type called type_armor.  My one object, a helmet, has a property of slot = head, and then when the player says &quot;wear helm&quot;, if it's in the room and the player doesn't have it, I give it to the player, then test to see if the object is of type type_armor. \r\n\r\n If it is, I then check to see what the value of the property called slot is via a case statement.  If it is head, and the player slot property head is null, then I assign the alias of the object to the player slot property called head.  I have overriden the default drop command to basically clear the player slot property if the alias of the object matches the object's given slot type.\r\n\r\nI have only built the one object, but there's enough in my template program from those case statements that I could sit there and copy the case statements in notepad and modify the asl that way.  I built everything below exclusively through the QDK.  I kind of like it.  More versatile than Adrift and more rapid to build content with than TADS.\r\n\r\nFrom the first room in the game, which is the only room visible to the player in my template, type &quot;test&quot; and that'll get you to my template's test environment where the helm exists.  The warehouse, which is a room where I'll put everything I could clone for the player into other rooms, is empty (this is just going to be my template game file when I'm done so the warehouse in the template will always be empty).\r\n\r\nPart of what I like about the way I've approached this is that I can turn right around and make type_attire, for such things as cloaks, etc., so that clothing can be layered, and all I need to do to get that to happen is add more properties to body playerslots object for head_attire, torso_attire, etc.  So I could have a tunic and a cuirass on the torso slot, pauldrons and a cloak on the shoulders slot, an aventail and a scarf or pendant on the neck slot, etc.\r\n\r\nCommands I either crafted over overridden are drop, wear, and inventory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[code:1ifcosfr]' &quot;template&quot;\n' Created with QDK Pro 4&#46;02\n\n!include &lt;stdverbs&#46;lib&gt;\n\ndefine game &lt;template&gt;\n\tasl-version &lt;400&gt;\n\tgametype singleplayer\n\tstart &lt;loc_intro&gt;\n\tgame author &lt;Mark Taylor aka xordevoreaux&gt;\n\tgame version &lt;00&#46;01&gt;\n\tgame info &lt;Created with QDK Pro 4&#46;02&gt;\n\tdefault fontname &lt;Courier New&gt;\n\tdefault fontsize &lt;10&gt;\n\tdescription &#123;\n\t\tmsg &lt;&#91;#@quest&#46;currentroom#&#93;|n#quest&#46;lookdesc#&gt;\n\t\tif not &#40;

I like your clock idea, I did a very different system which had variables for hour, second1 and second2 (so when it was say 12:02, it said that and not 12:2 if you just have hour and secend variables). I liked your idea. Your time though is sot to 'disabled' though which means time is stopped.\r\n\r\nYou're doing really well for just starting.

Two things:<br/>1) A suggestion: have a room like the inventory room for stuff you're wearing as the inventery saying 'you have a helm. you're wearing a helm' can be confusing as to whether it is the same helm or there are two. Cy'll be very easy to change your code to do it and it'll look better, maybe make things easier for checking, etc.<br/>2) Nothing to do with the wearing stuff. I like your clock idea, I did a very different system which had variables for hour, second1 and second2 (so when it was say 12:02, it said that and not 12:2 if you just have hour and secend variables). I liked your idea. Your time though is sot to 'disabled' though which means time is stopped.<br/><br/>You're doing really well for just starting. Tr0n and me are the two major helpers at the moment, we're both really good but if you need help on how to do stuff in QDK I can give instructions.",
