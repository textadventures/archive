I've two questions.. \n\nFirst, not sure if I am using the correct terminology here, but I have an image.. and I'd like it if the image was clickable. Clicking the image would execute the command 'go to' and move the player to a different room.\n\nSecondly, if it is possible to do the above, how can I go about setting the correct position of the picture? I am hoping to be able position it with a more specific position than just left, right, or center. \n\nI appreciate all those who've posted on the forum with solutions as they help more than just the OP. I've been through many many many threads already and have used the help provided in them, I just couldn't find anything regarding this.",
