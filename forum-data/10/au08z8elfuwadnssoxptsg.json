Problem is, when I use the item, It shows me both the item used text, and the text I want it to display when the item is used a second time. It seems to me that it's running both scripts at once, when I want it to do one and then switch to the other. It wants me to script it to check for the flag and I cant figure it out.\r\n\r\nThis is the link for the part of the tutorial I'm on: http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/more_things_to_do_with_objects.html\r\n\r\nThis is what the tutorial is telling me to do: \"Notice what happens when you type “use defibrillator on bob” a second time - you get the same response again. You should know how to fix this now - update your “use defibrillator on bob” script to check for the “alive” flag. Update this now.\" I can't figure this bit out",
