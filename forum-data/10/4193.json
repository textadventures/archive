I didn't want it to be possible to take the potion out of the jar, so I made it impossible to [b:ror0m0hz]take[/b:ror0m0hz] or [b:ror0m0hz]drop[/b:ror0m0hz] the potion.

You'll probably want to customize the messages on the jar for opening/closing and for taking the potion, but if you'll never put anything else in the jar I think this might be the simple solution.",
