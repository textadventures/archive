      "EditableText": "Hello.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nI just realized that your issue might not have anything to do with browser compatibility.  You *might* just need add a format to your 'publish file extensions' thingy:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/releasing_your_game.html#a-note-on-the-publish-process\r\n\r\nIf that isn't the solution, read on.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWARNING:  My answer will be a bit discouraging, but honest. (None of this is Quest's fault, by the way. It's browser drama.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nhttps://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/adding_sounds.html\r\n\r\nIf you are playing your game in the Windows desktop version of Quest, you can only play WAV or MP3 files from the ```play sound``` script, but it can only play WAV or OGG files from HTML audio elements (no MP3).\r\n\r\nThis is because:\r\n1. Quest's ```play sound``` script only looks for WAV or MP3 files. (It was just written that way, I'm afraid.)\r\n2. Quest has the Chromium browser built into it, but it is an older version of Chromium which was released when MP3 was not a free format. (https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/4997/no-mp3-sound#34377)\r\n\r\n---\r\n...but wait!  It gets worse!  \r\n\r\nIf you are playing the game online, which browser are you using?  That makes a difference. Also, is it a mobile browser?  (That would be an additional can of worms.)\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/adding_sounds.html#browser-compatibility\r\n\r\n---\r\nAnother \"issue\" is that all the different browsers (except for the one built into the desktop version of Quest) are constantly updated.  In fact, I'm pretty sure some of the information in Quest documentation concerning audio in a mobile browser is out of date.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI learned to avoid adding any audio (or video) which the player would actually need to hear (or watch) to progress in the game.  (It took me quite a while, but I learned.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nFULL DISCLOSURE\r\n\r\nI say I learned to avoid using audio, but, in one case, I was quite fond of one bit of audio.  So, I included it in the game, *but* I also made sure to print some text which would let anyone who couldn't hear the audio know (A) that audio could be \"heard\" in the game world and (B) what exactly could be heard -- which was a clue needed to successfully complete the game.\r\n",
