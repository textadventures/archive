      "EditableText": "I have a player that flies. I structured my rooms to have a walking and flying room description. Inside is easy because the descriptions are the same because the player is constrained to the room. \r\nOutside, I copy the walking description and add \"looking down\". This was the easiest way for me with out adding extra rooms above every outside room in the game.\r\n\r\nHowever, a player flying in an outside room, created to be above a ground room can be handle easily by placing the above or flying room inside the ground room. The player will not know the difference and when they stop or are forced to land you can use\r\n``` \r\nplayer.parent = player.parent.parent\r\n```\r\nSo, I use a \"fly\" and a\"land\" command for the player to use. The land can be like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf (player.flying = true) {\r\n     player.parent = player.parent.parent\r\n     msg (\"You decide to land.\")\r\n}\r\nelse { msg (\"You are not flying.\")  \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis places the player in the ground room.\r\n\r\nIf you have separate rooms already in use.\r\n```\r\nexitname = GetExitByName(player.parent, \"down\")   <!---  this gets the down exit name -->\r\nexit = GetObject(exitname)  <!---  this holds the name in a variable -->\r\nMoveObject (player, exit.to)   <!---  this move the player to the named exit-->\r\n```\r\nGot this from \r\n[Calling exits](https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/wfzjfe6feearrwl4qbve-a/calling-exits/ \"Title\")\r\nAlso use: \r\n[Getexitbyname](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/getexitbyname.html\"Title\")\r\n \r\nHopefully I got the script right. \r\nIf not someone will fix it here in a bit.\r\n\r\n",
