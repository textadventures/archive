      "EditableText": "Thanks guys. I decided to go the route of not using an actual exit and just using scripting to move the player to the next room when they interact with the hole. It worked for me. I have zero experience with coding so I'm trying to stick to the GUI for now and pick up a bit of coding as a I go along, so this seemed the easiest way for my purposes. Frankly, learning the language is a very daunting task that I'm not prepared to tackle just yet. Thanks for the extensive advice. I'm sure it will come in handy later when I start to really learn the language.",

      "EditableText": "In my game there is no reason to go back to the first room once you're out so I didn't worry about that. I'll try to explain how I did it as best I can. In the first room there is a wall. I set the wall to be a container (surface) containing a loose brick that, when pried away, exposes the hole. I set it so that the loose brick and the hole are only visible if the player is looking at the wall. Since the wall does not exist in the next room, you can't look at it, and therefore can't see the hole and can't climb back through it. Does that make sense? I wish I could explain it more clearly.",
