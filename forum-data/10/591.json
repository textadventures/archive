      "EditableText": "Hello. I am currently using timers in a game and have run into a problem : it would be very useful that, at a certain command from the player, the timer be reset. The command timeroff seems to only stop the timer from ticking, not to reset it to zero, and the timer is deactivated and reactivated frequently, so it causes serious problems. If it is impossible to reset a timer, can you think of a way around this problem? Thanks.",

      "EditableText": "Personally I would suggest perhaps using a status variable or object property to manipulate the timer.\n\nPerhaps give a player a property Timer1=30 and a property Timer1Action=doPoison, now you can simply make a timer of 1-second that repeats itself, and everytime it runs, it checks every object in the game to see if has a property Timers(or whatever you want) is greater than 0, then for each timer subtract 1 from the Timer%number% property value. This is a way of implementing multiple Timers, but within the code, only running one continuous timer.\n\nCode for something like that could easily be made from within QDK's menus if you just re-read what I typed and walk step by step in QDK.",

If you're infact talking about a timer for (let's say) 10 seconds, 5 seconds through you stop it, then start it again 3 seconds later - and there's still 5 seconds to go instead of 10 seconds...

Where Alex has coded a simple 'pause' in the timer.\nA reset would be a good idea if this is true (I don't know if it is or is't true).",
