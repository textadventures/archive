I know how to make a locked exit and I know how to prevent it from even being seen, but how do I make it so that when the enemy is destroyed, the pathway opens. Also, how do I give the player the ability to fight? Is it just a long series of possible verbs or is there a way to take the battle away from the main room into a pokemon-style separate arena in word form? Thanks for any and all help you can give me <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
