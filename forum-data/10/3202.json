I am trying to make a choose your own adventure that does two special things: (a) keeps track of a score to show the number of pages found (say, displaying 40 of 80, showing you've found 40 pages of the 80 total pages) and (b) change the best ending around the other endings that have been experience. I know how to do this in the text adventure, but don't know if it's possible in the gamebook mode.\n\nBasically, if it's possible,two things could work.\n\nEither adding functions (if, etc.) into the gamebook mode or, if that is not possible, adding links to the next pages similar to the gamebook mode in the text adventure mode (which I assume is possible because of the links for directions).",
