I found that having the vehicle in the Players Inventory works tojust move the player around and still be described as &quot;In&quot; the vehicle.

Please point me to a forum post that explains this if it exist,( I didn't see one) or give me an idea yourslf.

Great solution.Now if I can exit, referencing a global string (I have 60 or more locations to change).. move (player) to (#room#) I just haven't figured out where to put the global string and the proper string text to use. I can just move the player because vehicle is in inventory and is described to the player as if they are in it. And it goes where player goes. <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  \nI'll keep practicing the global strings.\nThanks again for the great show and tell on this  one.
