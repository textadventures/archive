I've actually been doing fairly decently on my own, however I have run into one particular problem... Menus.\n\nI have it so that the game starts out, you can set your name. But when it comes to setting your gender I wanted to use a Menu where you can choose male or female (to prevent people from typing in things like chicken). I looked at the given tutorials for menus and stringlists and such but for some reason it's just not making sense. This isn't the only scenario wherein I will be wanting to use something like this, so if someone could help explain how to create a working menu for choosing something (for instance I plan on adding a store later), I would be immensely grateful.\n\nAlso, and I realize that this might be much to ask, but... Tutorials are great, but I learn best by studying other works. For instance when I taught myself Python and C, I learned more by studying available codes from completed, open-source programs. Would anyone be willing to share one of their completed works with me? I have no intentions of copying or anything devious, it's just how my brain works. I fully understand if not however.\n\nI've been having fun with this program though! Looking forward to getting a good idea on how everything works.",
