When I downloaded, I have no idea of anything related to creating text games but the UI it's just awesome. Now, the question.\n\nFor example, I have an NPC, and he gives the player a mission. When the player completes the mission, he talk with the NPC again to get another mission. I have been doing this with objects that work as achievements, but they'll fill the inventory in the future, so I want to ask if it is possible that when I finish that first mission, I write something in my journal, like: &quot;That mission was a challenge, I hope something good in return&quot; and then, when I talk to the NPC again, if I have this write down in the journal, he will give me another mission, but if I don't, he will not.\n\nTo create the journal I have followed this tutorial <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Journal\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Journal</a><!-- m -->\n\nThank you for reading it, I will appreciate any advise from you.\n\nP.S.

      "EditableText": "Hello Siset that's an intriguing idea I should imagine that after each object has been used and will not be used again, you can destroy it. Of which quest has that ability to do,  or another idea would be to have a location and possibly name it BIN or something like that and move each item to there.  Also at a later date it's possible that you could use certain objects again, by moving them back to the game scenario. Each new mission could be a new location or room with other rooms nested inside, but I should imagine that it would get complicated unless you kept a tight rein on it all. Best of  luck with it all.
