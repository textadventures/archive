An NPC called `npc`\r\n2. An object called `object`\r\n3. A room called `obj`\r\n\r\nIt gives the object to the NPC, then moves the NPC into the room.\r\nIt also sets the NPC's `score` to 10, and the NPC's `maxscore` to 20.\r\n\r\nIf this is what the function is supposed to do, you need to work out which object is `object`, and which room is `obj`.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't what the function is supposed to do, can you try to explain what you want it to do?
