However, I'm somewhat familiar with other game engines such as adrift, tads and rags.\n\nNow I have an idea for a game that is a bit different from the normal setup of run of the mill IF games and those I've been checking out most IF game engines out there to see if there are any that have/can create the features I want in the game. And now the turn has come to Quest.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone can tell me off the bat if Quest can make a game that includes the following features.\n\n-Random Game Length.\n\n-A character creator for the player that allows him to choose what stats his PC will have. \n\n-A random number generator to work as die.\n\n-A difficulty check system that compare the the PC stats + die with the stats of MOB/OBject + die. (Think D20 system. roll D20 and add result of die to your stats and the the npc   \n does the same and highest one wins.)\n\n-A Health Point system.\n\nOf course, these things doesn't have to work exactly as I described it. If quest for example have a inbuilt battle system that could be modified to do some thing similar to what I ask for that's fine too.",
