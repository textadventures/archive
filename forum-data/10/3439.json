Add in some message for its description, but also had in this script line too:<br/><br/>dictionary add (wizard.ask, orc, msg (&quot;You need to kill the orc for his key to open up the locked door&quot;))<br/><br/>so, when you ' look at orc' it will now create the wizard's hint code for what to do with the orc, and thus you will only have this hint code option after you ' look at orc ', as you want the orc to be unknown by the game player, until he's got to that point in the game, and not revealed ahead of time due to the wizard's hint options.<br/><br/>this will add this hint into the ask script block for your wizard, it should now be a choice, you should be able to type in ' ask wizard about orc ' or see the hyperlink option choice for ' orc '.<br/><br/>so (I think) it should look like this (for the orc):<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookat type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>    dictionary add (wizard&#46;ask, orc, msg (&quot;You need to kill the orc for his key to open up the locked door&quot;))<br/>    msg (&quot;He's big, green, and mean&quot;)<br/>  &lt;/lookat&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>and the wizard's code block, hopefully should now look like this:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;wizard&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object /&gt;<br/>  &lt;ask type=&quot;scriptdictionary&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;item key=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;<br/>      msg (&quot;You need to kill the orc for his key to open up the locked door&quot;)<br/>    &lt;/item&gt;<br/>  &lt;/ask&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>if you want to use a menu, it's pretty much the same:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;topics type=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;/topics&gt;<br/>&lt;/game&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;wizard&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;speak type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>    show menu (&quot;Hint about what?&quot;, game&#46;topics, false) {<br/>      switch (result) {<br/><br/>&lt;!--<br/>HK Edit&#58; thanks Pertex for this correction! of switch (game&#46;topics) { to switch (result) {<br/>--&gt;<br/><br/>        case (&quot;orc&quot;) {<br/>          msg (&quot;You need to kill the orc for his key to open up the locked door&quot;)<br/>        }<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/speak&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookat type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>    list add (game&#46;topics, orc)<br/>    msg (&quot;He's big, green, and mean&quot;)<br/>  &lt;/lookat&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre>",

or &quot;talk to&quot; conversational model seems like it would work great. Wouldn't you have to override the scripting that already exists to handle stuff like &quot;talk to&quot; or &quot;speak to&quot; in the game code? I'm beginning to think Quest is actually more complex to learn than Inform 7, seems like it's made for programmers with scripting knowledge and skills than people with no coding experience, but I'll keep trying. Thanks for the help, I'll figure it out eventually.",

or &quot;talk to&quot; conversational model seems like it would work great. Wouldn't you have to override the scripting that already exists to handle stuff like &quot;talk to&quot; or &quot;speak to&quot; in the game code? I'm beginning to think Quest is actually more complex to learn than Inform 7, seems like it's made for programmers with scripting knowledge and skills than people with no coding experience, but I'll keep trying. Thanks for the help, I'll figure it out eventually.",
