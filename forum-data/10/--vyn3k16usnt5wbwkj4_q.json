      "EditableText": "> but it doesn't work\r\n\r\nWhat doesn't work?\r\nIf you can show your code, and tell us what the error message is, then someone will probably be able to see what's wrong.\r\n\r\nThe most common problem with this kind of thing is Quest's weird issue with inherited lists. If you haven't altered the object's display verbs in the editor, then before you can change them you will need to make them concrete by doing:\r\n```\r\nname_of_object.displayverbs = name_of_object.displayverbs\r\n```\r\nAfter that,  you can add a verb before the 'jump' scene by doing:\r\n```\r\nif (not ListContains (name_of_object.displayverbs, \"Jump\")) {\r\n  list add (name_of_object.displayverbs, \"Jump\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand afterwards (when the object is moved, or when the player leaves that area), you could do:\r\n```\r\nif (ListContains (name_of_object.displayverbs, \"Jump\")) {\r\n  list remove (name_of_object.displayverbs, \"Jump\")\r\n}\r\nif (not ListContains (name_of_object.displayverbs, \"Touch\")) {\r\n  list add (name_of_object.displayverbs, \"Touch\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if this is an actual *verb*, it's  a little more complex. Because any verbs an object had are automatically added to a list called `generatedverbslist`, which is created the first time the player sees the object. By default, Quest displays both the `displayverbs` *and* `generatedverbslist`.\r\n\r\nSo… you can either use the different tickboxes above the display verbs list to control which list(s) are used; or you can make sure the unwanted verbs are removed from `generatedverbslist` as well, using the same method. Before altering generatedverbslist, you would need to make sure it has been generated, by doing:\r\n```\r\nGetDisplayVerbs (name_of_object)\r\n```",
