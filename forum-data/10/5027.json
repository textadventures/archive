There's a container in the room. When the room is dark the container can't be seen or opened. However, if I make the room light then dark again I still can't see the container but it can now be opened. \n\nThis isn't something I can solve with a script either. Before opening container just gives the option to construct a message or get the default. I can run a script in after opening container but if I do that to stop it being opened the default 'you have opened it' message will still appear.",
