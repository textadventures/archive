But then I have another propery: Lit=False/true\nMy plan is to use custom player command \"Light torch\"\n\nWith the criteria: If player has battery and torch propery Bulb=true\nthen set lit=true.\n\nThis doesnt work - and I cant figure out why.\nIf I simply use the command: if \"light\" then lit=true that works. And I can get both my torch properies to true. \n\nBut not with the added criteria of needing to have a battery in ones inventory and the bulb=true. It simply jumps to the 'else' in stead.\n\nMy second question is shorter and rather embarrasing.\nHow do I get a put in item out of its container? \n\nGrateful for any answers or the meagrest of hints.\n\nRegards\nDennis",
