      "EditableText": "lol it was already explained to you NOT to use playerid. All of the code in the [b:edu309n7]with &lt;#player#&gt;[/b:edu309n7] will cause userid to refer to #player#'s userid. If it is not in the with statement, then it will refer to the player that typed it in. You shouldn't even need $name(#player#)$ at all. Simply use #@player# and it will give you the player's alias (name). You will need the playerid variable to reflect the [b:edu309n7]attacker's[/b:edu309n7] id if the attack variable is refering to the attacker's strength or something.This code should work. To make it easier to code you should use attack as a property. I'll change that. The additional code you wanted added will work if the attack property of Squiggle (set at init or otherwise) is 10000 or whatever. Do this with:\n[code:edu309n7]\nif &#40; $name&#40;%userid%&#41;$ = Squiggle &#41; then property &lt;Squiggle; attack=9999&gt;\n[/code:edu309n7]\nPut that in the player init.\nChange all playerid's to userid. As long as the #player# has a variable attack, you should be safe. So with everything, this is:\n[code:edu309n7]\ncommand &lt;/a #@player#&gt; if property &lt;#quest&#46;currentroom&#91;userid&#93;#; pkon&gt; then &#123;\n      set numeric &lt;playerid; %userid%&gt; \n      with &lt;#player#&gt; &#123;\n         dec &lt;hp&#91;userid&#93;; $objectproperty&#40;$name&#40;%playerid%&#41;$&gt; \n         if &#40; %hp&#91;userid&#93;% &lt;= 0 &#41; then &#123; \n            msg &lt;|bYOU HAVE DIED|xb&gt; \n            goto &lt;Carbralos Tavern&gt; \n            set numeric &lt;hp&#91;userid&#93;; 100&gt; \n         &#125; \n         else msg &lt;You were attacked and have lost 7 HP&#46;&gt; \n      &#125; \n      msg &lt;You attacked #@player# for |b7|xb HP&#46;&gt; \n   &#125; \n   else msg &lt;|bYou cant attack here!|xb&gt;\n[/code:edu309n7]\nIf you want it otherwise, I'm sure you can code it yourself.",
