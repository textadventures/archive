This is what I want them to look like:\n\n--- Character Stats ---\nHealth: 100\nMana: 100\nName: FudgePacker McGee\nAge: 14\nMagical Ability: 1000\n--- Universal Stats ---\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Sunny\nDate: 10/9/08\n\nAnd I get this (in game):\n\n--- Character Stats ---\nHealth: 100\nMana: 100\nName: FudgePacker McGee\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Sunny\nDate: 10/9/08\nAge: 14\nMagical Ability: 1000\n--- Universal Stats ---\n\n\nSo I think that the order they appear in the status variables box should be the order they appear ingame.",
