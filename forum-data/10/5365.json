It may require three or more pages of explanation, but simple saying, as you do: &quot;Here the say command is extended...etc.&quot; is completely confusing to beginners such as me. Showing the code doesn't help since we're not entering the code; we trying to use the drop-down menus, etc...\n\nIn fact, the problem goes back even further. When you explained the weigh command on page 35 you mentioned Bob. But where did Bob come from. I've been trying follow the instructions from the beginning, but the tutorial never explained how to set up Bob as an object, how to give him attributes, etc...\n\nNow, on p. 36, there's a Troll? And all of those instructions as shown on the screen shot of the script make no sense.\n\nI'm so frustrated that I'm about to dump this entire Quest application and go back to Alan, an application that I know works and that doesn't involve non-intuitive drop downs.\n\nBefore I do this, however, I'm hoping that someone can take this &quot;saying&quot; information (p. 36) and explain it in simple, clear instructions.\n\nThanks,\n\n-- Ben",

The place where I'm stuck is the &quot;Additional Example&quot; which comes right after &quot;Checking for An Attribute.&quot; The instruction is extremely thin here and -- for me -- impossible to follow. \n\nI did figure out how to put a &quot;Bob&quot; and a &quot;Troll&quot; into the room (still using the Lounge from the 1st steps). And I was able to follow the instructions under &quot;Adding a Simple Command&quot; (so that I got the required general responses when shouting or saying something). But the next steps -- differentiating between the two characters still elude me.\n\nThanks,\n-- Ben",

In this step, that command is extended to handle a &quot;to&quot; object. So you should go to your &quot;say #text#&quot; command, extend the pattern to be &quot;say #text# to #object_one#, set &quot;Name&quot; to &quot;saying&quot;, and then change the script to be what is shown there, which is a simple switch on &quot;object_one&quot;, with different msg's depending on the object.\n\nI don't  know how to do the &quot;simple&quot; switch on &quot;object_one&quot;.

So many thanks for that.\n\nI should point out that there seem to be major discrepancies between this solution and the instructions shown in the Tutorial. To wit:\n\nOn the command pattern line the tutorial instructs me to enter\n\n     say #text_talk# to #object_one#\n\nwhereas your solution for that line is\n\n     say #text# to #object#\n\nIn both cases, the name line is “saying” (no quotes)\n\nOn the unresolved object line, the tutorial has me enter\n\n     Say that to who?\n\nYour solution has nothing on that line. But it doesn’t seem to make any difference because when I play the say and enter “say hi,” for example, the game doesn’t output “Say that to who?” On the contrary, it outputs “I don’t understand your command.” (I know, this is a default answer).\n\nThen we’re down to that big Switch Section.\n\nIn the little box after “Switch,” the tutorial says I should enter\n\n     object_one\n\nYour solution for that box just calls for \n\n     object.\n\nAnd finally, in the key/Script section, matching bob, for example, the tutorial asks for:\n\n     Print “You say. “ +text_talk / Print “Bob smiles back at you.”\n\nWhereas your solution calls for the expression:\n\n     Print text + “” + object.name(or alias) + “, how are you doing?” \n\nIf these discrepancies didn’t matter – if both ways of doing it produced the same results – there wouldn’t be a problem. But, try as I might, I wasn’t able to get the tutorial’s solution to work. Do you have any idea of the reason for the problem? Is it an issue of proofreading or has Quest changed materially since the tutorial was first published?\n\nOne last thought: although I don’t seem able to right-click, copy-and-paste my work using notepad, I can take screen shots of specific pages and send those along with my questions.
