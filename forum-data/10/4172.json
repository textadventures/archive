Fine. Create a task – call it “ding” – which when typed moves the player to the twenty-first location.\n\nSay you have a puzzle which you want to test with the player holding a gun and a length of rope. Add commands to the “ding” task to move the gun and length of rope to being carried by the player. \n\nSay you want the puzzle to only work if the player has previously spoken to Bob the gardener and has discovered the location of the hidden door. Create a variable – if that’s what Quest calls them, if not you can probably figure out what I mean – to determine whether the player has spoken to Bob the gardener and whether he’s discovered the location of the hidden door. If so, have the “ding” task change the relevant variables to completed.\n\nRun the game, type ding – hey presto! You’ve jumped to the part in your game you need and don’t need to replay the earlier parts.",
