(like &quot;moving&quot; to other rooms: i suppose i would only have one &quot;room&quot;)\n- Can i change text fonts?(i'd like some star wars aurabesh) or background color (i'd need black blackground)\n- Can i display images or sounds, or special events? (I'd like some things like hacking to potentially sound a loud alarm, a screen-wide red band that blocks the players out of the system)\n- Some things will require real life rolls before i display a result. For example, if players try to enter a command like &quot;hack firewall&quot;, can i then have an IF structure where the players will input their real-life dice rolls results, and display different information based on that IF?\n\nThanks everyone <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
