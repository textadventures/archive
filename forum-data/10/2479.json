While inserting an image for a room, I wanted to centre it on the screen, so I first inserted the image then attempted to set Print to justify center, followed by a justify left to align the text after the image is shown. This has worked on previous occasions but the script editor seems to have a mind of it's own and when selecting Print and align left, the script entry just has Print&quot;&quot; showing instead of Print&quot;[JUSTIFY: LEFT]&quot;. Oh, and the Print&quot;[JUSTIFY: CENTRE]&quot; is sometimes followed by [NEWLINE]. So what is the correct sequence of events for entering and adding script commands in the rooms Advanced section. Spent nearly an hour trying to get a script sequence and gave up! This is driving me nuts.\n <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? -->\nI'm using V4.15",
