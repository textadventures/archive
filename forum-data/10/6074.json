I've seen the possibility of using a function, but I run into a similar issue there.

Well, what is it, then?&quot;)\n      setPlayerName\n    }\n  }\n}\n[/code:1tk3ouf7]\n\nInstead of waiting until setPlayerName is finished recursing, the next message will be printed immediately and everything will continue on. How can I make it wait until this has been set?",
