      "EditableText": "So I was playing Deeper, published by The Pixie, and noticed the loading issue mentioned elsewhere on this forum. I'm new to coding so forgive me if I'm wrong, but I think I have a basic quick-fix for missing stats breaking the game upon loading a save file.\r\n\r\nMy first suggestion is to add a script that, if upon doing the end_of_turn stat_check, finds that stats are missing, brings up a popup allowing you to set the stats(health, strength, agility, intelligence, stamina;). This would take away from the \"emersion\" of the game, but the alternative is not being able to play after saving. There have been plenty of times in this game where I've gotten pretty far and don't want to restart completely, then I die and everything crashes.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is including a cookie in which to store info like inventory, stats, dungeon layout, etc. Use the idea suggested above about sensing missing stats, and run script to source from the cookie file instead of using the presets.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to have the stat defaults set to 1, and incorporating an in-game option for manually changing stats. I'd suggest the demon always found on level three, or the trader Kam. You would just need to add an option to request stat changes.\r\n\r\nI'm currently playing with the code for your game, The Pixie, and seeing if I can come up with any more ridiculous skims to help be able to save. Hopefully something comes of it, because I have an unhealthy obsession with this game. Right now I reset points to a 30 point buy to make dying less frequent, but I don't have a quick-fix for needing to end a session and pick up later yet.\r\nAny ideas anybody?",
