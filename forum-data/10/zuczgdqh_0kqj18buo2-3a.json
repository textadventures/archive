      "EditableText": "You probably want to use a turnscript. Turnscripts are a simple way to deal with anything you want to happen every turn.\r\n\r\nYou'd have a script something like:\r\n```\r\nif (Contains, (bedroom, game.pov)) {\r\n  game.pov.oxygen = 30\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  game.pov.oxygen  = game.pov.oxygen - 1\r\n  if (game.pov.oxygen < 1) {\r\n    game.pov.health = game.pov.health - 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat seems simple enough. If the player is in `bedroom`, their `oxygen` attribute is reset to 30; anywhere else it is reduced by 1. If it's 0 or less, their health is reduced by 1 as well.\r\n\r\nYou can use different numbers if you prefer. Or you could make it a random amount by changing either (or both) of the lines to something like:\r\n```\r\n  game.pov.oxygen = game.pov.oxygen - GetRandomInt (1, 3)\r\n```\r\nwhich reduces the oxygen by 1, 2, or 3 points at random each turn.",
