In which case you always use the loop variable, not the actual object name.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking about verbs, or other scripts which are part of a particular object, you can use the special variable `this` to refer to the current clone. `this` always refers to the object whose script is running. (So in a verb, `this` is the specific clone that the player can see)\r\n\r\nWhen the player takes over a different character using `ChangePOV` or similar, always use `game.pov` to refer to the current player object.\r\n\r\nIf you have any more specific problems, I think a lot of people would be happy to help.",
