In order to stop an actual command working, you need to check within the command.\r\n\r\nYou would normally set some attribute so you can check later if you need to. For example, if you give Jim an \"annoyed\" flag that stops him talking to you, then his script for the 'speak' verb might be:\r\n```\r\nif (GetBoolean (jim, \"annoyed\")) {\r\n  msg (\"You can't talk to him because he's annoyed.,\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  // The rest of his speak script goes here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to check for the displayverb itself, you could do:\r\n```\r\nif (ListContains (this.displayverbs, \"speak\")) {\r\n  // your speak effect goes here\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You can't speak to him now.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you want to permanently delete the verb for an object, you could do something like:\r\n```\r\nobjectname.speak = null\r\n```",
