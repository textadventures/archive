      "EditableText": "Hello, I am working on my first game and running into an issue I have yet to resolve.  I would like for my player to have a discussion with Christian Doppler in which they are making observations about light waves.  When the player makes a correct observation, Doppler asks another question.  (This piece I am okay with.)  When the player makes an incorrect observation, Doppler asks them to look more closely and asks the question again.  I cannot seem to get an incorrect answer to loop back to the previous question, and I am not sure if I am missing something simple or if there is a more elegant way to approach these types of conversation.  Here is the code. Thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\n``` <object name=\"Christian Doppler\">\r\n      <inherit name=\"editor_object\" />\r\n      <inherit name=\"namedmale\" />\r\n      <look type=\"script\">\r\n        picture (\"Christian_Doppler.jpg\")\r\n      </look>\r\n      <speak type=\"script\">\r\n        Ask (\"Hello!
