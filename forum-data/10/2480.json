I've gone through a few different things in my head with the program but wanted to ask you about what you think the best way would be and a few dif options if you think of them. You don't have to explain in full detail if you just tell me what the idea is and i can figure it out or look into it.",

Like if its a maze and after a few turns for them to know which direction they are going. Something to keep up with direction like with each turn to let them know if they are facing east west north or south. Just any method to keep up with that per each room. It's slightly important in one part of the game it would be helpful. Maybe not necesarry atm I'm not sure just going through a few things in my mind on this part.",

Then if they are pushing north to go east and want to turn left(west) then they will actually be facing north by pushing west. I don't know for sure if i need this though i'm still going through my options for this part of the game. I just had kind of a bump in the road and was trying to brainstorm ways to get over it. I'm thinking I can put an indicator in the picture or I may be able to make the pictures work i'm just not sure yet it's a very complicated part of the game to create.",
