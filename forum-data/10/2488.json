Like if i wanted it to be 3.5 seconds or .5 seconds or .2 seconds.\nAlso a little trouble i'm having with timers is they dely if i'm changing rooms slightly fast.",

So basically it's not the accuracy, I just wanted a quicker second. You said you didn't recommend using timers for high accuracy. Did you mean there was something else to use? And the reason there is a problem with the timers stalling while flipping through rooms, is that someone can just run through this area real fast and avoid timers. And I guess my game isn't really a text adventure but, it's what i'm using the program for.",
