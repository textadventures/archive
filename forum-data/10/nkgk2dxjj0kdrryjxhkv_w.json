Explosives \r\n\r\nUsing the combat system reccomended by the quest documentation, is there a way to construct an explosive (My whole development team have dubbed this \"DynoMight\") that damages buildings and players?\r\n\r\n3. Saving (FYI Not related to battle royale)\r\n\r\nI can't seem to get quest to save/load any games! It works on that seedship one, but nothkkng else.",
