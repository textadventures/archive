As soon as I load it onto my surface pro 3 (with Windows10) the layout goes completely haywire. Photos change size completely and it is necessary to constantly scroll, making the whole thing unusable. I am reluctant to put in any more effort if I can't solve this as the game is going to be pretty unplayable on some systems. Any help would be greatly appreciated",
