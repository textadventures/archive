I had some trouble using an actual list for it, since I wanted to edit the text (strikethrough a completed task, for example), so I decided to work around it by creating a To-Do list as an invisible object, and making the tasks part of the description. Currently, I am trying to make it so looking in a mirror sets the flag \"seen\" on the object player, and that returns the list struck through. I am doing it with the following code:\r\n```\r\nIf object does not have flag - object - player - flag \"seen\",\r\nPrint message \"- Figure out what I look like.\"\r\n\r\nElse,\r\nPrint message <strike> \"-Figure out what I look like\"</strike>\r\n```\r\nHowever, when I call the \"todo\" command, it returns this:\r\n```\r\n> todo\r\nScript: if (not GetBoolean(player, \"seen\")) { msg (\"Figure out what I look like.\") }\r\n```\r\nHow can I make it not give me the whole script?\r\n",
