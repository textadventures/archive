Also, the map/grid can't handle vertical layers (moving 'up' and 'down'), and needs to thus be rebuilt each time too. Jay has some random map generation libraries (see the libraries and code samples forum board), which might get into how to re-build your map/grid when not using Exits or moving vertically (up/down).\r\n```",
