I think there should be a way to show the grid at some times and not other times, and also differentiate one floor from another. I would even add extra script to clarify where every room is if I knew how, so that teleporting into a room would not slide the yellow dot off into no man's land instead of placing him into the square that once, but no longer, would (and always should) represent the room the player is teleporting into.\r\nI doubt it would be easy to explain to me, but it could really work.  I still think it could be built-in, maybe in an upgrade, one day.\r\nMeanwhile, thank you for reminding me to switch to up and down over in and out. I also found a script, that erases the grid and resets it on a page called \"showing a map\". I may need to work with that too.\r\nI am also looking for a script to change the grid_fill, one room at a time, but have put that query into a separate post. I don't know if an answer to that even exists.",
