      "EditableText": "I just started working on my first game last night after reading all the tutorials and some further experimentation, but I think I've made a mistake in the process and have no idea how to fix it. I'm using the web app, which I know is less robust than the Windows version, so I acknowledge that this was probably my first mistake, but I'd also prefer to continue using it for convenience.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual issue... One of the grabbable items in my first room is a lighter, so I added some verbs to it. I set \"flick; use\" as my first one,  thinking it would be a shortcut since the outcome should have been identical when used for the lighter specifically. But after doing that, it broke the \"use\" verb for every other item in the game. Now if I attempt to type \"use (whatever)\" it gives the response \"You can't flick; use it.\" Whenever I try to add \"use\" or \"flick\" on their own as a verb for any other item (including the lighter now if I remove it first), it adds \"flick; use\" instead. I can't find any way to de-link these two verbs.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this within the web app (or, alternately, a way to open my web game in the Windows version), or am I out of luck? Thanks for any input whatsoever!",
