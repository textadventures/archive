It works great it Quest with no errors. I have been updating this game the last couple weeks with no problems.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, no matter how I try to upload it, it's giving me the error; \"The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.\" once the upload completes.\r\n\r\nI tried to make a new/different account, but that is giving me the exact same problem.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what's going on here?\r\n\r\nHere is the game; http://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/ea87r7nej0u5ozopoanyuq\r\n\r\nI have been working on this for weeks and only have 4 hours before I need to be on a plane with this accessory/game/app to a convention in Vegas. I thought I'd upload my final changes and this sudden error is giving me a lot of problems, so any help is appreciated.",
