Obviously when you lose health you should not be looking good, so I thought implementing some scripts that would fix this problem. \n\nNow, I did as you suggested with the global commands and it works, but since I wasnt very clear I still have a problem with the program not recognizing the name you choose in the game. So, your solution works if I type the command that applies to generic names like look at; examine; check player, health, status, etc. What I need to know is how to make the program check player's health if one is using a player.alias from the character creator? Or how does one erase or edit the &quot;Looking good&quot; comment. I cant find it anywhere, so I have no idea where it is coming from.\n\nPS. While I am at it, I am also wondering if there is a way to include the description of your custom name (player.alias), gender and class when you look at your player. For example, when I type examine Mareus, I want also to be able to get a description of how you look like based on what you chose in the character creator. So for the script I posted it would be: &quot;You are Mareus, male knight. You are wounded and should seek a healer.&quot;\n&quot;You are a male knight. You are currently wounded.&quot;",

      "EditableText": "Jay has already answered most of your questions, but I'll comment anyways too, hehe.\n\n0. the two most powerful~useful scripts, which will allow you to do almost anything and everything that you want to do:\n\nin the GUI~Editor:\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a script -&gt; scripts -&gt; if... -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (type in whatever you want it to do ~ though you'll have to know how to write using quest code of course)\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a script -&gt; variables -&gt; set a variable or an attribute -&gt; (set it up)\n\nin code:\n\nif (Object.Attribute = Value_or_Expression) {\n-&gt; // script(s)\n] else if (Object.Attribute = Value_or_Expression) {\n-&gt; // script(s)\n} else {\n-&gt; // script(s)\n}\n\nif (orc.condition = &quot;dead&quot;) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;The orc is dead&quot;)\n}\n\n~OR~\n\nif (orc.condition = &quot;dead&quot;) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;The orc is dead&quot;)\n} else if (orc.condition = &quot;alive&quot;) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;the orc kills you&quot;)\n-&gt; msg (&quot;GAME OVER&quot;)\n-&gt; finish\n}\n\n~OR~\n\nif (orc.condition = &quot;dead&quot;) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;The orc is dead&quot;)\n} else if (orc.condition = &quot;alive&quot;) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;the orc kills you&quot;)\n-&gt; msg (&quot;GAME OVER&quot;)\n-&gt; finish\n} else if (orc.condition = &quot;drunk&quot;) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;The orc is drunk&quot;)\n} else {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;The orc is asleep&quot;)\n}\n\nAn Attribute ('savable and loadable' ~ can be used~referenced~called upon within any script in the game, so long as the object still exists of course):\n\nObject.Attribute = Value_or_Expression\n\nA Variable (can only be used~referenced~called upon within that same script it is in):\n\nAttribute = Value_or_Expresion\n\n------------------------\n\n1. this is a bit of an annoyance, that I too (and many other people as well) was confused by, as it's not exactly made-known to people:\n\nYour Player Objects can both be used as Player Objects and as Object Objects (like an npc~townsperson or a table), and thus you've got 2 descriptions and locations of those descriptions in the GUI~Editor (and as Jay mentioned, you may have to also set~check the box, for your Player Object first as 'Can be a Player Object' too). &quot;You look good.&quot; is the default description for Object Objects. So, if you got your Player Object's player-object-description set up (typed in), but your Player Object isn't set (or isn't currently being used~controlled as a Player Object during game play), then you'll see the object-object-description of (if still as the default ~ you haven't typed in your own custom message for it) &quot;You are looking good.&quot; shown~displayed during game play for your Player Object.\n\nI believe it is the second tab from the left (can't remember what it is called... ?setup?) for an Object, that has the 'description' for your Object as an Object Object.\n\nAnd, the 'Player' tab, has the player-object-description (you may have to check the box for 'can be a player' first, for you to see the player-object-description box, if your Player Object isn't already set as this), for when your Player Object is being controlled currently as a player object during game play.\n\n2. Character Creation\n\nthis is a very good 'next step' after doing the tutorial, though it's quite a step up in difficulty, but that's okay, as it teaches you to understand quest and the coding world designs much better.\n\n(you can see my own progress going from a total noob to quest and to coding, to where I am now, in the thread that I created called 'HK's noob help me thread&quot; ~ do a search for it, hehe)\n\nObjects hold Attributes, so this is your way of 'saving and loading' Attributes for then being able to use them within any script that you want (so long as the Object still exists, aka you don't 'remove' or 'destroy' the object, hehe).\n\nin GUI~Editor:\n\n(whatever) Object -&gt; Attributes (tab) -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt;\n\nObject: (whatever)\nAttribute Name: (whatever)\nAttribute Type: (you decide: string, integer~int~non decimal using number, double~decimal using number, boolean~flag, script~verb, string list, object list, string dictionary, object dictionary, script dictionary, or object)\nAttribute Value: (depends upon your Attribute Type, and then it's 'whatever' you type in for it)\n\nObject: player\nAttribute Name: strength_integer\nAttribute Type: int\nAttribute Value: 100\n\nyou're 'attaching' the Attribute to the~an Object\n\nin code, it looks like this:\n\nas a creation 'tag':\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;whatever&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;whatever&quot; type=&quot;you decide&quot;&gt;your_typed_in_value&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n(using my own labeling system, hehe)\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n-&gt;

type=&quot;listextend&quot;&gt;Fight&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n--------------\n\nyou can also just do 'variables' too:\n\n('Variables' are just Strings~Attributes that are NOT 'attached' to an Object, aka no dot~period)\n(and because of this, you can only use them within the script they're within, you can't use them in some other outside script, as they're not 'saved', and thus can't be 'loaded' within that other outside script)\n\nVariable = Value_or_Expression\n\nresult = &quot;red&quot;\nresult = 9\nhandled = false\nvalue = 9\nvalue = &quot;red&quot;\nyou_go_first = false\ny = x\ny = x + 5\n\n---------------\n\nso... for character creation:\n\ngame (Object) -&gt; Scripts (Tab) -&gt; Start Script -&gt; Add -&gt;\n\n(the 'game' Game Object's 'start' Script Attribute is the very first thing that the game does, even before displaying the room description, so this is a common place to put your 'character creation' script~function block, but you can add your scripts~functions anywhere too: as~within Objects' Verbs, as~within Commands, as~within other Functions, as~within TurnScripts, as~within Timers, as~within other Scripts, and etc. For an example, using character creation, maybe I want a sci-fi tube machine Object that you discover halfway through game play within the game which will create more Player Objects, as you can switch between, aka control, multiple Player Objects, or even maybe creating non-player Objects, like for~as having team~party members, hehe)\n\n(in code, as it's much quicker for me, lol)\n\nmsg (&quot;what is your name?&quot;)\nget input {\n-&gt; // quest's 'get input' function automatically (and hiddenly) sets: result = your_typed_in_input_during_game_play\n-&gt; // however, we want to set that to an Attribute (Object.Attribute), aka 'save' it, so that we can use ('load') it anywhere (same as 'calling a function', but we're 'creating and saving, for then calling~referencing~using' an Attribute later in some other script within our game, instead of a Function, hehe):\n-&gt; player.alias = result\n-&gt; show menu (&quot;What is your gender?&quot;, split (&quot;male;female&quot;, &quot;;&quot;), false) {\n-&gt; -&gt; // quest's 'show menu' function automatically (and hiddenly) sets: result = your_choice from the pop up menu's selection of choices~options\n-&gt;-&gt;

add a script -&gt; output -&gt; Print a message -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see below)\n\nyou need to break it down into 2 types of 'chunks' to understand how to type it correctly (correct syntax):\n\nThe 2 'Chunks':\n\n1. &quot; text &quot;\n2. + Object.Attribute +\n\nthus the chunks for:\n\nplayer.alias = &quot;HK&quot;\nplayer.gender_string = &quot;male&quot;\nplayer.race = &quot;human&quot;\nplayer.class = &quot;warrior&quot;\n\nmsg (player.alias + &quot; is a &quot; + player.gender_string + &quot; &quot; + player.race + &quot; &quot; + player.class + &quot;.&quot;)\n// outputs~returns~displays~shows: HK is a male human warrior.\n\nplayer.alias +\n&quot; is a &quot;\n+ player.gender_string +\n&quot; (space) &quot;\n+ player.race +\n&quot; (space) &quot;\n+ player.class +\n&quot;.&quot;\n\nthis will help you greatly type it out correctly without errors, but it'll still take a lot of practice and frustration, lol\n\nthis took me quite a while to be able to do this, and I still have trouble with it even now, though understanding the '2 chunks' concept really helps a lot.\n\n----------\n\nhere's another example:\n\nplayer.damage = 100\nmonster.alias = &quot;orc&quot;\nmonster.hp = 500\n\n(pretend we got a damage script, doing the subtracting: monster.hp = monster.hp - player.damage: 500-100)\n\n(remember that you *MUST* set the 'print a message' to [EXPRESSION], as this enables the use of your 'Object.Attribute' calls~references~loading of your Attributes in the message)\n\nmsg (&quot;You do &quot; + player.damage + &quot; damage to the &quot; + monster.alias + &quot;, leaving it with only &quot; + monster.hp + &quot; HP left.&quot;)\noutputs: You do 100 damage to the orc, leaving it with only 400 HP left.\n\ncan you break it down into the correct chunks?\n\nanswer:\n\n&quot;You do &quot;\n+ player.damage +\n&quot; damage to the &quot;\n+ monster.alias +\n&quot;, leaving it with only &quot;\n+ monster.hp +\n&quot; HP left.&quot;\n\n---------------------\n\n&quot;room&quot; (object) -&gt; Room Descriptions (or whatever it is called) (tab) -&gt; Description -&gt; run as script -&gt; add a script -&gt; output -&gt; print a message -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see below, but in code though)\n\nroom.alias = &quot;catacombs&quot;\nroom.light_or_dark = &quot;dark&quot;\nroom.length = 44\nfriend.alias = &quot;mike&quot;\nfriend.condition = &quot;dead&quot;\nmonster.alias = &quot;man-eating crocodile&quot;\nroom.walls_conditiion = &quot;blood&quot;\nplayer.condition = &quot;sick&quot;\nfriend.gender = &quot;him&quot;\n\nmsg (&quot;The &quot; + room.alias + &quot; is a &quot; + room.light_or_dark + &quot; maze, that is &quot; + room.length + &quot; miles long, that your best friend, &quot; + friend.alias + &quot;, got lost in, and is now &quot;

You hope to be able to find him soon, as you don't want to be eaten up by the man-eating crocodile. The catacombs' walls are smeared with blood, and you feel sick already.

add a script -&gt; output -&gt; Print a message -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>you need to break it down into 2 types of 'chunks' to understand how to type it correctly (correct syntax):<br/><br/>The 2 'Chunks':<br/><br/>1. &quot; text &quot;<br/>2. + Object.Attribute +<br/><br/>thus the chunks for:<br/><br/>player.alias = &quot;HK&quot;<br/>player.gender_string = &quot;male&quot;<br/>player.race = &quot;human&quot;<br/>player.class = &quot;warrior&quot;<br/><br/>msg (player.alias + &quot; is a &quot; + player.gender_string + &quot; &quot; + player.race + &quot; &quot; + player.class + &quot;.&quot;)<br/>// outputs~returns~displays~shows: HK is a male human warrior.<br/><br/>player.alias +<br/>&quot; is a &quot;<br/>+ player.gender_string +<br/>&quot; (space) &quot;<br/>+ player.race +<br/>&quot; (space) &quot;<br/>+ player.class +<br/>&quot;.&quot;<br/><br/>this will help you greatly type it out correctly without errors, but it'll still take a lot of practice and frustration, lol<br/><br/>this took me quite a while to be able to do this, and I still have trouble with it even now, though understanding the '2 chunks' concept really helps a lot.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>here's another example:<br/><br/>player.damage = 100<br/>monster.alias = &quot;orc&quot;<br/>monster.hp = 500<br/><br/>(pretend we got a damage script, doing the subtracting: monster.hp = monster.hp - player.damage: 500-100)<br/><br/>(remember that you *MUST* set the 'print a message' to [EXPRESSION], as this enables the use of your 'Object.Attribute' calls~references~loading of your Attributes in the message)<br/><br/>msg (&quot;You do &quot; + player.damage + &quot; damage to the &quot; + monster.alias + &quot;, leaving it with only &quot; + monster.hp + &quot; HP left.&quot;)<br/>outputs: You do 100 damage to the orc, leaving it with only 400 HP left.<br/><br/>can you break it down into the correct chunks?<br/><br/>answer:<br/><br/>&quot;You do &quot;<br/>+ player.damage +<br/>&quot; damage to the &quot;<br/>+ monster.alias +<br/>&quot;, leaving it with only &quot;<br/>+ monster.hp +<br/>&quot; HP left.&quot;<br/><br/>---------------------<br/><br/>&quot;room&quot; (object) -&gt; Room Descriptions (or whatever it is called) (tab) -&gt; Description -&gt; run as script -&gt; add a script -&gt; output -&gt; print a message -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see below, but in code though)<br/><br/>room.alias = &quot;catacombs&quot;<br/>room.light_or_dark = &quot;dark&quot;<br/>room.length = 44<br/>friend.alias = &quot;mike&quot;<br/>friend.condition = &quot;dead&quot;<br/>monster.alias = &quot;man-eating crocodile&quot;<br/>room.walls_conditiion = &quot;blood&quot;<br/>player.condition = &quot;sick&quot;<br/>friend.gender = &quot;him&quot;<br/><br/>msg (&quot;The &quot;
