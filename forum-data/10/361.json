      "EditableText": "I got my earlier problem of \"ask mary to dance\" to work.  While doing so, I encountered a strange problem.  When I referenced the object with #@AskTarget# to see if it had a dance verb defined it wouldn't work.  But when I referred to the target as #AskTarget# to see if it had a verb defined everything worked.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Perhaps someone can tell me why #AskTarget# works when I would have thought #@AskTarget# would have worked better...\n\nHere is the code sample for the command.  This one works.... I bolded the area in question....\ncommand &lt;Ask #@AskTarget# to #AskRequest#&gt; {\n\t\tif ( #AskRequest# =  ) then msg &lt;ask #@AskTarget# what?&gt; else {\n                       [b:1pnd3j6d]if action &lt;#AskTarget#; #AskRequest#&gt; then doaction &lt;#AskTarget#; #AskRequest#&gt;[/b:1pnd3j6d] else msg &lt;#@AskTarget# doesn't know how to #AskRequest#!&gt;}\n\t}\n\nThis version does not work.  I simply added the #@ to check if the object has the action defined.\ncommand &lt;Ask #@AskTarget# to #AskRequest#&gt; {\n\t\tif ( #AskRequest# =  ) then msg &lt;ask #@AskTarget# what?&gt; else {\n                       [b:1pnd3j6d]if action &lt;#@AskTarget#; #AskRequest#&gt; then doaction &lt;#@AskTarget#; #AskRequest#&gt;[/b:1pnd3j6d] else msg &lt;#@AskTarget# doesn't know how to #AskRequest#!&gt;}\n\t}\n\n\nThis seems strange to me.  I thought it would be preferrable to refer to the object itself with the #@ to check for the existence of an action, but it didn't work for me.\n\nThanks for any advice.\n\n-Radar\n[/b]",
