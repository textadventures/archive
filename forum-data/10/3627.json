      "EditableText": "Hi everybody ! I've just tried gamebook mode in Quest 5.4, as it sounds really good now. But I noticed some useful scripts seem to miss comparing to text adventure mode. For exemple, &quot;Wait for key press&quot; doesn't appear in output scripts, although &quot;WaitForKeyPress&quot; function appears in the library elements. I know Alex said some scripts were not relevant anymore in gamebook mode, but this one could be useful as a narrative element, don't you think ?\nSo my question is : can I do something to make this script visible in the &quot;add new script&quot; panel ?\n\nThank you very much for your help !",
