Meaning, if Player1 takes the scroll, the scroll will be regenerated so that Player2 can take the scroll as well.\n\nI've tried running a script to clone the scroll when a player \"gains\" it, but this returns an array locked message in Questnet Server and locks the game. \n\nIs there an easy way to do this, I can also see this playing into my merchant system as well. Where, if a player buys a sword, a new sword is generated for the next player to visit the merchant.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks\nbds1313",
