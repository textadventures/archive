      "EditableText": "Sounds like you have added a new verb to do something else entirely; CRACK/OPEN. When you add a verb to an object, behind the scenes Quest also adds a verb _object_ to the game. This can be hard to spot in the off-line editor, but is not even visible in the on-line editor, so you would never know. When the player types OPEN, this verb _object_ takes precedence over the built-in OPEN command; quest notes there is no \"crack\" attribute to your container, and so spits out that error message.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as verb objects are not visible in the on-line editor, your only option is to contact Alex and ask him to fix it too (might be worth linking to this thread when you do).",
