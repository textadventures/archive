The first would be creating a duplicate of the room your in, one would be the normal game room when the player is free to do as the game allows normally, and the second version where the player is trapped. The other method would be to use a [url=http&#58;//docs&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/quest/scripts/get_input&#46;html:25bjst00]get input[/url:25bjst00] which will basically remove the players ability to use the normal commands and give you complete control over their available actions and the results.\n\nThe first option is probably the simpler of the two. basically the trapped room will have all the same descriptions and objects that the normal room does,  but you can then change the descriptions or command results on the objects or whatever else in that room, so that the responses will line up with the situation. Then when the even that frees the player occurs, you move them to the normal version of that room.\n\nThe second option using get input is a bit more complicated but give you a lot more control. Basically get input will take the next thing the player types and save it as a hidden variable 'result', and nothing will happen unless you tell it to. This takes more work as you will need to account for all the things the player should be able to do, however you have complete control and can give the player as many or as few choices as you'd like. This is particularly useful for menu type situations where you do not want any normal character actions to happen.
