I'll use the wait script and clear screen to run a couple of pre-title credits, but then I want to finish on a nice slow fade-in of the game's title (it's an image).\n\nI guess I'd use CSS like this, but I'm not sure how I would target the title image. I know under normal circumstance the image url would simply go where [b:1s3ejwka][i:1s3ejwka]/image.jpg/[/i:1s3ejwka][/b:1s3ejwka] is in the code, but I'm not altogether clear.\n\n[code:1s3ejwka]\n#image {\n    background&#58; url('/image&#46;jpg/') no-repeat center center fixed;\n\n    -webkit-background-size&#58; cover;\n    -moz-background-size&#58; cover;\n    -o-background-size&#58; cover;\n    background-size&#58; cover;\n\n    -webkit-animation&#58; myfirst 5s ; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */\n    animation&#58; myfirst 5s ;\n  }[/code:1s3ejwka]\n\nThanks in advance.",
