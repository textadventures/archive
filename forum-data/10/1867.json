I've already added the script logic to prevent reading the journal in case there are no pages in it yet, so the menu won't have to deal with the case where there is nothing in the journal. Thus the menu can start with one item in it &quot;Chapter 1&quot;, which the player can select. But how to add the other menu items as the player finds (and inserts) more pages into the journal?",
