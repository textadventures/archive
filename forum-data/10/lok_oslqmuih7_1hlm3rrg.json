I know how to do the timer, and I know that it has to do something with Turn Scripts, but I can't wrap my head around it. \r\n\r\nUpdate : Messing around I found out about \"Run Script after number of turns\" command. It fixes one of my problems, but it arises a new one. I cannot find a way to disable it once it's function is done. I want it to play a message and send me back to a room, which it does. The problem with it is that now every other movement has it play the message and move me back, soft locking me. I tried both \"Disable turn script\" and \"Suppress turn scripts\" but they don't work. Any way to fix this?\r\n",
