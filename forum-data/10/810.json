If you haven't downloaded QDK and are scripting without it, I'm much less knowledgeable, but inside QDK creating objects is as easy as clicking a button.\n\nFor skills, I would advise custom player commands (you can find those in the game settings) coupled with status vareable, one numerical vareable for each skill. When you used one of the skills on something, the custom command would use conditionals to see if your current level (the status vareable) was sufficient for whatever you were trying to do.\n\nQuestion for the old timers: can you generate a random number inside of quest?",
