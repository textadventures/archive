Your code sucks because ____!\"\r\n\r\nI don't aspire to know everything, and I'm never out to prove that I'm right and anyone else is wrong.  My goal is to see the truth.  To know that what I *do* know is actual fact.  If what I believe to be flawless is error-prone, I want to know so I can dig deeper and learn why and how everything is doing what it's doing.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlso, I only have one feeling at my age, and, if you can hurt it (which you can't), I would consider it a favor.
