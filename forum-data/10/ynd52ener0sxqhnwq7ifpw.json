I use menus for this because I don't want them to be able to avoid these choices, and I don't use commands because I don't want them to be able to reselect these particular choices. However, I want a lot of these choices to be spoken responses to add more flavor than \"tell him [thing],\" but menus don't seem to work when quotations are used. Avoiding quotations altogether is out of the question because sometimes I want the menus to display BOTH dialogue and actions.\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround for this, or is this just functionality that Quest doesn't support?",
