For most objects this is irrelevant; it's only there in case they become the player.\r\n\r\nThe default script is:\r\n```\r\n      if (game.pov = this) {\r\n        if (IsDefined(\"oldvalue\")) {\r\n          OnEnterRoom(oldvalue)\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n          OnEnterRoom(null)\r\n        }\r\n        if (game.gridmap) {\r\n          MergePOVCoordinates\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      this.hasbeenmoved = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I want to overwrite it (if it's even possible in the web editor).\r\n\r\nYou can't directly override attributes in the web editor; the nearest you can get is giving the object an initialisation script something like:\r\n```\r\nthis.changedparent => {\r\n  // whatever you want the script to be goes here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that if you are including a new changedparent for an object that the player might control, you need to make sure you're not missing out any of the important bits. In particular, `MergePOVCoordinates` must be run whenever the player moves in order for the map to work correctly; and `OnEnterRoom` is responsible for most of the stuff that happens when the player moves to another room, including showing the description, clearing the screen between rooms (if enabled), and checking whether it needs to run any room enter/exit scripts.",
