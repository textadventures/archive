For a while I thought perhaps I lost all messages once it hit the map, (There is no scroll bar.) but then I discovered I can drag the map all the way to the top of the screen or all the way to the bottom and it will scroll so I can see past or present messages.  Or more simply I can just press the “scroll up” or “scroll down” keys to perform that action much easier.\n\nBut I would prefer just to move it to the right hand side if there was room.  I suppose this would depend on the game and how much the screen is filled up on either side, but truly where it is located at now, I do not like it.  But I do appreciate the map none the less and I think it is a great feature... if only we could scoot it a little.   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",

Maybe even have it as a pop up window, that way it obstructs nothing.  Maybe allow for zomming in and out, in case it was decided to keep it small, you could still see areas around it.  I mean you should not need it that big if it is only a guide, unless you had some other use for it.",
