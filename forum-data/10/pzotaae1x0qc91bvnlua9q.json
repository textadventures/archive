      "EditableText": "Well you have two options here. First would be the \"run a script\" check box in the exit tab of the exit itself. which allows you to make the exit run a script when the player tries to use it. The downside is this overrides the built in movement part of the exit so you have to move the player within the script which can get tedious if used a lot.\r\n\r\nThe second option is trickier to setup but may result in less overall coding if you're planning to use this a lot. The second method is to create a custom version of the 'go' command, which you do by enabling library elements to be displayed and locating the 'go' command and then hitting the button to create a copy of it, which will then allow you to modify the actual code. Note that I'm not sure if this is possible in the online editor. From there you'll see the 'go' command has an 'if else' block for when an exit is locked and whatnot. What you'll want to add to is the final 'else' since this is what happens when an exit is normally usable. From there I'd add a message display right before the movement that checks the an attribute of the exit itself for a description string and show it if it exists. Then you just need to create that attribute on any exit that has a special movement message.",
