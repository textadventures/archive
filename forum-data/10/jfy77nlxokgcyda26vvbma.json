If I use \"clone\" and then I add the scrip \"move\" it works but the other one don't.\r\n\r\n2- some verbs don't show in the screen or don't work.\r\n\r\n For my game the player have to \"read\" a manual but the verb (\"leer\") don't work. I had too change it to \"look\" (\"mirar\") or even \"read the\" to work.  \r\n\r\nThen the player can click in a door and see the verbs list but  \"open\" (\"abrir\") don't appear. I added some random verbs and they show.\r\n\r\nMy quest version is from a year (or more) ago so I don't know if those are bugs were common and solved in some new version or are something else. ",
