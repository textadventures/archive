      "EditableText": "No problem, here's how to type it in, starting from a new game:\n\n1. Select 'game' in the pane on the left and delete the game name.\n\n2. Select 'Commands' and add a new command called 'say'. For the pattern type 'say #text#'. Choose to run a script and paste this into code view:\n\n[code:1zyxek8t]\ninput = LCase (text)\nif (input = &quot;twin alchemy&quot;) {\n  msg (&quot;Coming Spring 2015&quot;)\n}\nelse {\n  msg (&quot;That is not the correct passphrase&#46;&quot;)\n}\n[/code:1zyxek8t]\n\nThe [i:1zyxek8t]input = LCase (text)[/i:1zyxek8t] just makes sure that someone can type the phrase with different capitalization of letters and it'll still work. LCase means to lowercase the text, see <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/LCase\">http://quest5.net/wiki/LCase</a><!-- m --> . Writing 'text' matches the command pattern of #text#. You could write #myText# and myText if you wanted to. \n\nBtw, I couldn't reproduce that bug of typing only 'say' and getting the correct response -- could you paste in a transcript of that?\n\n3. Add a new room called 'wooded clearing'. \n\n4. Add an object called 'bottle', move it into wooded clearing if necessary ('Move') is in the upper right of the UI). \n\n5. Add an object called 'message' and put it in the bottle. \n\n6. Select the player and move it into the wooded clearing. \n\n7. Select the bottle. For its look at description choose to run a script, and paste this into code view:\n\n[code:1zyxek8t]\nif (Contains (bottle,message)) {\n  msg (&quot;There appears to be a {object&#58;message} inside (and spiders&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;)&#46;&quot;)\n}\nelse {\n  msg (&quot;It's empty&#46; &quot;)\n}[/code:1zyxek8t]\n\n[i:1zyxek8t]{object:message}[/i:1zyxek8t] creates an object link you can click on, see <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Text_processor\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Text_processor</a><!-- m --> . \n\n8. Select the Features tab of bottle and check off that it's a container. In the Container tab I then choose that it's open, transparent, cannot be opened and closed, and to hide children until looked at. \n\n9. Select the message. For its description choose text and paste in\n\n[code:1zyxek8t]\n&lt;a class='cmdlink' onclick='addTextAndScroll(&quot;It appears to be some kind of anagram&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;)'&gt;HYMNAL TWICE&lt;/a&gt;[/code:1zyxek8t]\n\nGiving it a class of [i:1zyxek8t]cmdlink[/i:1zyxek8t] makes it a command link like you would with Quest's {command:[i:1zyxek8t]command name[/i:1zyxek8t]}, but then you create your own custom behavior by adding the onclick attribute. \n\nOne thing I didn't fix was the text style of the &quot;It appears...&quot; response (it's different from everything else). You might be able to wrap it with a span tag and CSS to match the normal text style, I haven't looked into that though.\n\n10. Select the verbs tab of message and add 'read', select Run Script and paste into code view, \n\n[code:1zyxek8t]msg (this&#46;look)[/code:1zyxek8t]\n\n[i:1zyxek8t]this[/i:1zyxek8t] is shorthand for 'this object', you could write 'message' too if you wanted. [i:1zyxek8t]look[/i:1zyxek8t] is the attribute that Quest stores the description in. \n\nAnd that's it (I think).",
