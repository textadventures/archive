It's a gamebook game.\r\nI would like that when the player visited a page, when I suggest the different directions, the game no longer displays the same page. Otherwise, the game will loop endlessly ^^\r\n\r\nI think it's with the \"if\" function but I don't know how to set it up ...\r\nThank you ! <3",

      "EditableText": "What I think you are trying to do is get a 'new page' when the player has to choose. What you really need is the clear screen. This clears everything that happened before. Then, if you switch function, so when the player picks options and they lead somewhere, bad, you can restart the game, but only if the bad choice is picked. You can either end the game and make them start over or you can clear the screen and present the choices again. That way, if the good choice is picked, they can continue playing without going on a loop. The code would look something like this:\r\n\r\nClearScreen\r\nShowMenu (\"\\\"Which direction do you pick?\\\"\", split (\"left;right\" , \";\"), false) {\r\n  switch (result) {\r\n    case (\"left\") {\r\n      ClearScreen\r\n      MoveObject (player, leftroom)\r\n      msg (\"You went left!\")\r\n    }\r\n    case (\"right\") {\r\n      ClearScreen\r\n      MoveObject (player, rightroom)\r\n      msg (\"You go right!\")\r\n    }\r\n    default {\r\n      error (\"\\\"You must input 'left' or 'right' no other options will suffice\\\"\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}",
