For example, if I knew someone who would type &quot;view&quot; instead of &quot;look&quot; how would I mkae a Verb Alternative for Look?\n\nThe main problem I'm having is that I'm attempting to make &quot;Speak to&quot; work if the player types any of the following: &quot;Speak; speak to; speak with; talk; talk to; talk with&quot; but I put that in the Verb list and it said something about this overriding the default verb. Well, problem is that none of those verbs work except the first one on the list!\n\nI'm confused?",

Add the verb under Game/Verbs like this:\n\n[code:1agr7min]\nspeak to; speak with; speak; talk to; talk with; talk\n[/code:1agr7min]\n\nThen when adding the verb to an object, don't use the built-in &quot;speak&quot; verb.
