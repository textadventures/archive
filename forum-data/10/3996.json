If you edit the file in the texteditor, Quest shows a yellow bar that there are changes in the file and a button where you can reload the file. If you use a texteditor like notepad++ this works the other way, too.\nNormally I open my game in Quest and start playing. After changing something in the texteditor I just restart the game. When restarting a game, Quest loads the changed aslx file again.",
