So, I've been wanting to just look over them all and see how they work. Am I severely over-thinking the way adding custom verbs and commands works? And [i:33m6vm12]is there[/i:33m6vm12] a document that in some way defines the existing ones? I mean, even if I have to open up a library file to check out the code directly, that would be fine, but I don't even know what file that would be.\n\n[i:33m6vm12]EDIT:[/i:33m6vm12] If someone would like me to [i:33m6vm12]construct[/i:33m6vm12] such a list for the documentation, I'd be happy to do so, once I get a look at the definitions.",
