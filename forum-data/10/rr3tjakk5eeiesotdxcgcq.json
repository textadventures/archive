I cannot, for the life of me, learn any programming language. At the same time, I don't want to say \"hey go on this website i made this\" i want to give people a download link and say \"i made this\" essentially, I'm looking for something thats basic, but not a online service that's gonna make me look petty. Could anyone help me?",

O_o However I have had an idea for years and I tinker with my game off and on, then get side tracked and work on other games using Quest... ^_^  Quest is easy enough for anyone wanting to make the most basic, but enjoyable games quickly.  It also has a lot of intuitive features that allows you to do more interesting things with your game and still no coding is required, just basically point and click or drop and drag.  Then you have plug and play libraries, as I understand them, and they will make your game even better.  Then you have the nice people here who will help out.  I myself have asked for their services more than once and have received help quite quickly as well.",
