Anyway, it sounds as though Nero has associated itself with .CAS files. You can easily get Quest to \"steal\" them back, by going to the Options window, then Other, then click the \"Restore File Associations\" button. This will associate Quest with .CAS files again, so when you double-click them, Quest will open the file rather than Nero (or anything else).",
