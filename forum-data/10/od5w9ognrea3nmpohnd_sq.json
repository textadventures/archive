And when you load it back up, it runs smoothly again and everything loads super fast.\r\n\r\nGenerally that is indicative of a memory leak aka, the program not properly deleting its pointers when it no longer needs them, and the pointers eventually eat up all the memory available. I mention it as I noticed that Quest got an update a few months back and thought I'd mention it in case the developers of quest didn't know there was a memory leak.",
