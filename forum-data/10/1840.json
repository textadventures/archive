Are you entering this in the verbs setup area, ie; Print a message saying &quot;No time for lounging around&quot;? Or are you entering it in the object set up verbs list? It's a little confusing but I think you need to ADD the verb to the sofa object and specify the message there.\n\nYou could always open your games .asl file with notepad and paste it's contents here for a better solution, hope that helps.",

I suppose an easy fix would be to just remove your Sit on verb in the game definition block, that forces quest to simply run Sit on from the object properties, but this certainly seems like a bug involving how Quest handles surfaces or perhaps just with verbs in general.",
