However, other code uses ScopeExitsForRoom, including (probably) the room description code, which means you might have the same problem as in case 1.\n\n3) Copy the ScopeExitsForRoom function into your game, rename it to something else so only you are using it, and then change it to not pay attention to darkness. \n\nWith Quest, game creators have the ability to do change much of what the core code does by copying it into their games and modifying it. Or there can be even more power in writing your own code - the object model is exposed for you to manipulate as you wish.\n\n(To answer your question of &quot;why&quot;: the &quot;scope&quot; functions generally have to do with the higher level concept of what the player is directly able to manipulate in the current situation, and they tie into much of how the engine works. Given your scenario above, I'm sure you're quite happy that exits are excluded from the current room description when dark, for example. The function you're looking for - getting all exits for a room regardless of current state - is a valid need, but it's not a &quot;Scope&quot; type function. And given it doesn't exist in the core code, it probably has not been asked for before. So you can make your own!)",
