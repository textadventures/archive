      "EditableText": "Hello.\r\n\r\nThe online editor is stand-alone.  You can't upload changes to it.  If you want to update the game you created in the online editor, you must do it manually in the online editor.\r\n\r\nWhen you publish (or update) a game from the online editor, it still uploads the game file to the \"Play\" website, just like you do when you publish (or update) a game created (or edited) with the desktop editor.\r\n\r\nWhen editing a game (online or offline), we are editing an **.aslx** file.  This file cannot be uploaded to the online editor.\r\n\r\nWhen publishing a game, Quest compiles a **.quest** file, which is pretty much a zip archive which contains a master .aslx file (complete with all the libraries included in the game) and any media which may have been added.\r\n\r\nIf creating games with the desktop editor, we must upload our .quest file to the game's main page to publish or update the finished product.\r\n\r\nIf creating games online, the online editor uploads the .quest file to the game's main page when we publish or update the finished product.\r\n\r\nYou can start editing a game online, download the code, then edit that in the desktop editor, but you can't do it the other way around.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, I think Quest translates all the code into English when you publish to a .quest file, but your text should still be in your original language.\r\n\r\nThis will not be pleasant, but my only idea is to:\r\n\r\n- Download version 1.1 of your game (which you've already done)\r\n- Unzip the .quest file (which you've already done)\r\n- Open the game.aslx file with a text editor (such as Notepad or Notepad++)\r\n- Go through and find your revisions manually\r\n- Copy and paste the changes to your game using the desktop editor*\r\n- Never delete an .aslx file again\r\n\r\n\\* If you prefer to always use the online editor, make the changes there.
