In large games with lots of clones, this may result in large save files because it's saving copies of all those objects. Whereas `destroy (object.name)` actually deletes the object, which is good for clones but may cause errors if you use it for any object whose name is mentioned in the code, or inside of a `foreach` loop. For clones, `destroy` is the more efficient option, but it can cause some weird and confusing bugs so might be reserved for more experienced programmers)",
