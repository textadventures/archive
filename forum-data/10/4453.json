It also helps with with noticing forgotten-to-add 'elses' and~or their beginning~ending curly brackets too, lol-argh! As can be seen, you should be able to easily spot some mistakes I made in my haste to write it, lol. Also, for example, I'd have a very hard time figuring out whether else3 or else4 or else5 corresponds to if4, I'd have to scroll all the way up to find what if each else matches to, then scroll back down to the else, but by then, I've forgotten what I'm doing again, so I have to scroll back up to the if... laughs...

not equal to &quot;string~object&quot;, I need to code in, to make sure that the Attributes are properly correct and match up.\n\n----------\n\nmy combat code, wasn't really a universal system, I was just trying to code in your ranged~proejectile combat with monsters and damage, in a simple way, just to get something up, which we can then customize~change it to whatever you then want.\n\nbut, let's wait off on doing this, and first get this stuff working, then we can slowly build upon this, and with whatever else you want done, then we can work on fully doing a combat system, knowing everything that you want done, and having worked out all the individual parts first.\n\nBesides, I need to write the combat code using your own game code's nomenclature~labeling~style system, as it'll be too hard to try to convert my own nomenclature~labelization~style over to yours, laughs. I like underscores, you like spaces, and etc... easier to just write the code up from scratch using your style.\n\n--------\n\nlastly, for game makers, you really need to develop your code style~nomenclature~labelization patterns quickly and universally for yourself, as it really helps making things easier for you, and avoids messy-webs-of_confusion later on, as your game code grows.\n\nmine is this:\n\nuse underscores for spaces so I can easily read my Attributes and Objects, write out what those Objects~Attributes are in full for their Name, so I know exactly what they do or are for, add on it's attribute type at the end of the name, so I can keep the names the same, for example:\n\nage_string = &quot;adult&quot;\nage_integer = 18\n\nthis allows me to keep 'age' for both of them, but also two have them as two Attributes, by simply adding '_string' and '_integer'\n\ninstead of doing, maybe something ike this:\n\nAge = 18\nage = &quot;adult&quot;\n\nor\n\nage = 18\nmaturity = &quot;adult&quot;\n\nor\n\nintAge = 18\nstrAge = &quot;adult&quot;\n\n(I hate caps, as it just causes more code work for you: easier to just have everything in lower case, as you can type quicker and without mistakes, opps didn't hit~hold the shift key or oops held shift key too long, nor remembering whether it's a cap or lower case)\n\n(and by adding the Attribute type on it's end, I can see what type of Attribute it is, so I know what I'm working with, and to spot errors of conflicting Attribute Types in expressions)\n\nand lastly, in using long descriptive NAMES, I ensure that they are unique, laughs. And it also acts as comments lines, as I'm am directly commenting on the attribute via it's name attribute, lol.\n\nso this is my system that I've developed, and at least for the coding that I'm doing, it works pretty well (though I need to do a lot of copy and pasting, and my code is A LOT longer due to writing out long NAMES, but it helps me out with writing code).\n\n(I moved to this after I made my original combat code long ago, using all these abrevs, and not only did know one else knew what they stood for, I too had no idea what they stood for, when I went back to look at it, laughs)\n\nyou can probably recognize these (as they're quite common rpg labels now):\n\n[code:ghwe6lpc]HP (hit~health&#58;life points)\nMP (magic~mana points)\nSP (skill~spell points)\nLV or LVL (level)\nG (gold ~ currency)\nSTR (strength)\nEND (endurance)\nCON (constitution)\nSPI (spirituality)\nINT (intelligence)\nMEN (mentality)\nDEX (desterity)\nAGI (agility)\nSPE or SPD (speed)\nLUK (luck)\nSWD (sword)\nSPR ~ SPE (spear)\nPC (playable character)\nNPC (nonplayable character)\nALI (alignment&#58; evil~chaos, neutral, good~order)\nCHA (charisma)\nPIE (piety)\nAR (attack rating)\nAC (armor class)\nDMG or DAM (damage)\nPDEF (physical defense)\nMDEF (magical defense)\netc etc etc[/code:ghwe6lpc]\n\nbut, 'str' in quest coding also means 'string', so this could cause conflict problems, also I got into the issue of deciding more game attributes' abrevs:\n\n'spe' could mean 'speed' or 'spear'\n\nPC = playable character or personal computer, lol\n\npersonality = PER\nperception = PER\nwhat should I decide on the abrevs for each, as they both can't be PER\n\nso, it's just easier to write everything out, as everyone can understand it, including you, and you don't waste time creating your own abrev language:\n\nPERC = perception\nPERS = personality\nor, should I do:\nPCN = perception\nPSN = personality\nor\nPRCTN = perception\nPRSNLTY = personality\n\ntrying to set all up your abrevs, so they are all different.\n\nnow imagine coding abrevs... I don't know how real coders are able to do it, as I look at their labelization and I'm completely lost, laughs. I guess over years of coding you learn these labelization standards that they use, like any new language or field of study (like learning all the biology terms or law terms or chem terms: CHO's, and etc...

not equal to &quot;string~object&quot;, I need to code in, to make sure that the Attributes are properly correct and match up.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>my combat code, wasn't really a universal system, I was just trying to code in your ranged~proejectile combat with monsters and damage, in a simple way, just to get something up, which we can then customize~change it to whatever you then want.<br/><br/>but, let's wait off on doing this, and first get this stuff working, then we can slowly build upon this, and with whatever else you want done, then we can work on fully doing a combat system, knowing everything that you want done, and having worked out all the individual parts first.<br/><br/>Besides, I need to write the combat code using your own game code's nomenclature~labeling~style system, as it'll be too hard to try to convert my own nomenclature~labelization~style over to yours, laughs. I like underscores, you like spaces, and etc... easier to just write the code up from scratch using your style.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>lastly, for game makers, you really need to develop your code style~nomenclature~labelization patterns quickly and universally for yourself, as it really helps making things easier for you, and avoids messy-webs-of_confusion later on, as your game code grows.<br/><br/>mine is this:<br/><br/>use underscores for spaces so I can easily read my Attributes and Objects, write out what those Objects~Attributes are in full for their Name, so I know exactly what they do or are for, add on it's attribute type at the end of the name, so I can keep the names the same, for example:<br/><br/>age_string = &quot;adult&quot;<br/>age_integer = 18<br/><br/>this allows me to keep 'age' for both of them, but also two have them as two Attributes, by simply adding '_string' and '_integer'<br/><br/>instead of doing, maybe something ike this:<br/><br/>Age = 18<br/>age = &quot;adult&quot;<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>age = 18<br/>maturity = &quot;adult&quot;<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>intAge = 18<br/>strAge = &quot;adult&quot;<br/><br/>(I hate caps, as it just causes more code work for you: easier to just have everything in lower case, as you can type quicker and without mistakes, opps didn't hit~hold the shift key or oops held shift key too long, nor remembering whether it's a cap or lower case)<br/><br/>(and by adding the Attribute type on it's end, I can see what type of Attribute it is, so I know what I'm working with, and to spot errors of conflicting Attribute Types in expressions)<br/><br/>and lastly, in using long descriptive NAMES, I ensure that they are unique, laughs. And it also acts as comments lines, as I'm am directly commenting on the attribute via it's name attribute, lol.<br/><br/>so this is my system that I've developed, and at least for the coding that I'm doing, it works pretty well (though I need to do a lot of copy and pasting, and my code is A LOT longer due to writing out long NAMES, but it helps me out with writing code).<br/><br/>(I moved to this after I made my original combat code long ago, using all these abrevs, and not only did know one else knew what they stood for, I too had no idea what they stood for, when I went back to look at it, laughs)<br/><br/>you can probably recognize these (as they're quite common rpg labels now):<br/><br/><pre><code>HP (hit~health&#58;life points)<br/>MP (magic~mana points)<br/>SP (skill~spell points)<br/>LV or LVL (level)<br/>G (gold ~ currency)<br/>STR (strength)<br/>END (endurance)<br/>CON (constitution)<br/>SPI (spirituality)<br/>INT (intelligence)<br/>MEN (mentality)<br/>DEX (desterity)<br/>AGI (agility)<br/>SPE or SPD (speed)<br/>LUK (luck)<br/>SWD (sword)<br/>SPR ~ SPE (spear)<br/>PC (playable character)<br/>NPC (nonplayable character)<br/>ALI (alignment&#58; evil~chaos, neutral, good~order)<br/>CHA (charisma)<br/>PIE (piety)<br/>AR (attack rating)<br/>AC (armor class)<br/>DMG or DAM (damage)<br/>PDEF (physical defense)<br/>MDEF (magical defense)<br/>etc etc etc</code></pre><br/><br/>but, 'str' in quest coding also means 'string', so this could cause conflict problems, also I got into the issue of deciding more game attributes' abrevs:<br/><br/>'spe' could mean 'speed' or 'spear'<br/><br/>PC = playable character or personal computer, lol<br/><br/>personality = PER<br/>perception = PER<br/>what should I decide on the abrevs for each, as they both can't be PER<br/><br/>so, it's just easier to write everything out, as everyone can understand it, including you, and you don't waste time creating your own abrev language:<br/><br/>PERC = perception<br/>PERS = personality<br/>or, should I do:<br/>PCN = perception<br/>PSN = personality<br/>or<br/>PRCTN = perception<br/>PRSNLTY = personality<br/><br/>trying to set all up your abrevs, so they are all different.<br/><br/>now imagine coding abrevs... I don't know how real coders are able to do it, as I look at their labelization and I'm completely lost, laughs. I guess over years of coding you learn these labelization standards that they use, like any new language or field of study (like learning all the biology terms or law terms or chem terms: CHO's, and etc... I took chemistry a long time ago, can't remember any of them anymore, laughs)<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>also, as your game code becomes more like a REAL game code (millions of code lines and attributes and objects, lol), you need some major organization structure for finding~getting, and then using all your code lines~attributes~objects, I think this is the advanced coding stuff like 'parsing' and etc advanced code stuff.<br/><br/>for a simple example, for your Object's NAMES, I'd do this:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;player_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;player_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;player_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;person_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;person_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;person_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;dragon_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;dragon_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;dragon_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;orc_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;orc_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;orc_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;home_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;home_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;home_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;inn_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;inn_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;inn_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;weapon_shop_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;weapon_shop_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;weapon_shop_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;armor_shop_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;armor_shop_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;armor_shop_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;spell_shop_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;spell_shop_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;spell_shop_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;item_shop_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;item_shop_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;item_shop_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;sword_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;sword_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;object name=&quot;sword_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>etc etc etc</code></pre><br/><br/>using ALIAS for what we'd know~see as it's name, leaving the NAME for your own code organization and parsing~finding~getting behind the scenes, from the person playing the game.<br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>so get established your own system for code writing, as it really helps you out, though this causes everyone to have their 'pet peeves', they like their system, and cringe at anyone else's system, as it's often uses all the things that they don't like, laughs.",

I made the list for them already and what they will be like during combat. \nWe should talk about how combat is going to be like because like I said it's not a turn based combat where monster attacks then your turn then monster attacks. \n\nI don't know if it will be possible but making it where getting a random int will make the creature do something like shoot, panic, hide and it can be in different directions.",
