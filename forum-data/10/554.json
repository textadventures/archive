For example, I have the following objects, which correspond to actions in the game:\n\n[code:8wzy7lzl]define object &lt;action1&gt;\n\tproperties &lt;name=say hello; want=talk; fulfill=5&gt;\nend define\n\ndefine object &lt;action2&gt;\n\tproperties &lt;name=make smalltalk; want=talk; fulfill=15&gt;\nend define\n\ndefine object &lt;action3&gt;\n\tproperties &lt;name=converse; want=talk; fulfill=20&gt;\nend define[/code:8wzy7lzl]\n\n...etc\n\nYou can see that each action has properties associated with it.  Now I'd like to build a selection menu that allows the player to choose an action.  The menu should have all the actions from these objects, and not \"hard-code\" them.  Something like this:\n\n[code:8wzy7lzl]define selection &lt;want_fullfilment_menu&gt;\n\tinfo &lt;Choose a type of action&gt;\n\tset numeric &lt;action_num; 1&gt;\n\trepeat while exists &lt;action%action_num%&gt; &#123;\n\t\tchoice &lt;$objectproperty&#40;action%action_num%; name&#41;$&gt; script\n\t\tset numeric&lt;action_num; %action_num% + 1&gt;\n\t&#125;\nend define[/code:8wzy7lzl]\n\nI know this isn't legit code (I tried it!), but can you guys think of any way to handle this?\n\nThanks!",
