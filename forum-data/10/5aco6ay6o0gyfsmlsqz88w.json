      "EditableText": "> **1. How do I set that the maximum HP is 100? That even if the player takes pills or uses first aid kit, the player's life will not pass 100.**\r\n\r\nOne common way is to test if the HP is over 100, and if it is, reduce it. For example:\r\n```\r\nset (player, \"HP\", player.HP + 10)\r\nif (player.HP > 100) {\r\n  set (player, \"HP\", 100)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOr, you could do `set (player, \"HP\", Max (100, player.HP + 10))` (I assume this function is available in gamebook mode, but haven't tested it)\r\n\r\n> **2. How do I code it that the player will be Game Over when the player is killed or if the survivors that the player is supposed to protect dies?**\r\n\r\nTest if the HP is less than zero, and if it is, send them to the game over.\r\nIn a text adventure, it may be beneficial to have this test every time they take damage.\r\n\r\n**Alternatively** you can use a changescript. This will be run automatically every time the HP changes.\r\nIf you give the player a script attribute named `changedHP`, it will run every time their HP changes.\r\n\r\nSo you could make the changescript something like:\r\n```\r\nif (this.HP > 100) {\r\n  this.HP = 100\r\n}\r\nif (this.HP <= 0) {\r\n  // or whatever code you use to display a game over\r\n  msg (\"You died!\")\r\n  finish()\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis changescript makes sure the HP can't go over 100, and also triggers a game over if it goes to 0 or less. It means you don't need to put the checks in every time the HP changes.\r\n\r\n**BUT** in this case, if the player takes damage and there is more text on the page, it will display after the game over message.\r\nSo if a page has the player taking damage in the middle, you should use an `if` condition to ensure that the remainder of the page is only displayed if they're still alive.\r\n\r\n> **3. Is it possible to remove all existence of a teammate if he/she is dead?**\r\n\r\nQuest has no concept of \"characters\" or \"dead\". Those are in-game concepts.\r\nI assume that you have a counter for the NPC's HP, or a flag to indicate that they've died, or some other kind of attribute to keep track of their life/death status?\r\nIf so, you can use an `if` around their dialogue to check if they're still alive, and display something different if they're dead.",
