So I have a verb \"answer\" on the object \"door,\" but the \"Print a message\" assignment only provides a one-line input box. This isn't great for typing in large chunks of text such as a conversation. Is there another way to do this or should I just edit in Code View? Thanks.",

A separate msg statement for each line of the conversation.\r\n\r\nThough you could change the door into a room/object, and put the conversation in the 'description' field, so that Quest will add all the line breaks and escaping for you. Save messing about with HTML. I'm not sure, but I think the description attribute will stay there even if you change it back into a plain object, so you can then have your verb just print `{door.description}`",
