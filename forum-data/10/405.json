Maybe toss in a few conditionals within a custom command. Now copy that custom command and open up a different .ASL file (preferably one that has a bunch of custom commands with conditionals in it) in the QDK editor and paste that custom command code into the new file's custom commands area. What happens is the top branch copies over just fine and everything looks okay, but now click down a branch... it's pulled in code from other areas of the 2nd .ASL file. \n\nI ran a \"put rope on hook\" custom command that I pasted between .ASL files (a test file and my bigger main project one). What happened is the pasted code acted funny when I ran the game. I would type in \"put rope on hook\" and the code would go \"You can't get that\" or \"Maximum verbosity on!\" (obviously code from other custom commands I had written). So I looked at it and sure enough, one level deep and there's code from other areas of my main file.\n\nNot a big deal really. Just that if you do copy &amp; paste code within the editor between .ASL files it tends to somehow do funny things one level deep or more in the logic.",
