I was already thinking of having on the room editor a list where you could add objects into the room's scope. But that wouldn't help too much for &quot;universal&quot; objects, as you wouldn't want to have to add the computer to the &quot;extra objects in scope&quot; list for every room. So maybe something in the game options... but then, if you have non-ship areas in your game, you wouldn't want the computer there too. I suppose if all your ship rooms were inside a &quot;ship&quot; object, you could add computer to an &quot;extra objects in scope for all sub-rooms&quot; list for the ship object. Happy to hear any other suggestions!",
