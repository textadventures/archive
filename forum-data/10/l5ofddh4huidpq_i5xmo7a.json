This could result in the file being truncated.\r\n\r\nThe most common reason for this particular error is trying to open a blank file.\r\nThis could be because the file is unreadable for some reason (faulty disk?), or it could be that the 'save' routine replaced the file with an empty one ready to write out its current contents, but then crashed or was closed before going any further.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of error does Notepad++ give you? Trying to track down that error could help diagnose filesystem or permission problems. If it just shows you an empty file, then you're probably out of luck – this means that the file may have been erased by the computer shutting down at the wrong moment, or the Quest editor being forced to close unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nIt *may* be possible to get the file back using some kind of undelete or file recovery tools; I've done this before when I had a similar issue with Excel. But I've not used Windows in nearly 20 years, so I suspect the tools available now are quite different from the ones I remember.\r\n\r\nIt may also be possible to recover something from temporary files, but again I'm not sure how you'd go about that. I suspect that Quest might create a temporary .quest file when you run a game for testing; and if you can find that, it could be possible to extract the ASLX file from it. But it won't be easy.",
