I can perfectly write XML files if needed; on the other hand, I don't want to rely on any graphical interface (at least until the final compiling step if I have to launch the main program; of course compiling from the command line would be the best for me but it is OK to do it with an interface if I can everything else with a text editor).\r\n\r\nb) I want HTML/javascript output; I think this is the preferred output format for many tools like Quest. By the Way, did someone already experiment embedding the whole output in a mobile app with Cordova?

More precisely, I would like to write games like http://www.johnayliff.com/games/seedship/ (this one was coded with Twine I think) where the player repeatedly comes in the very same situation with new random features (in this game, each new step is a new planet with new random attributes). In other words, I would like to repeatedly cycle on the same pattern made of two or three \"rooms\" with a randomly changing content.\r\n\r\nd) Could something like a \"Pokemon battle\" be implemented: you are in a room fighting against a \"monster\"; some attributes are displayed; you have the choice between a few \"attacks\"; each choice involves computing some dammages; new attributes are displayed \"screen is refreshed\" and the fight goes further on.\r\n\r\ne) Could some basic stats/attributes be printed at a fixed place (top of the screen) like \"Day 42, sunny weather, HP: 56/100, strength: 12\", inventory, etc?\r\n\r\nf) Is the underlying programming language strong enough for implementing elaborated algorithms (for instance computing the result of an attack according to kind of weapons, statistics, various \"flags\", etc.)?\r\n\r\ng) can the content of a room be algorithmically generated (for instance if you repeatedly enter the same \"room\", it could be expected that the difficulty level of this step increases over the time, monsters be more dangerous, etc.)?\r\n\r\nThank you by advance,\r\n\r\nbest regards.",
