      "EditableText": "Yes, there used to be multiplayer support in Quest - the last version of QuestNet Server was v4.0.5.\n\nIt never really took off, partially because QuestNet Server wasn't quite as fleshed out as it could be, but also because it's hard enough to make a good single-player game, without all the added complexity of multiplayer. That, and you'd have to co-ordinate a multi-player game so everybody started at the same time - or make it huge enough that people could drop in and out. It would have to be never-ending and dynamic, always expanding and changing, and that just wasn't really possible with QuestNet Server, and even if it was then the amount of effort to create such a game would be immense.\n\nIt may happen again but I think we need to see single-player text adventures becoming much more popular before multi-player can ever take off. It may or may not happen... but hopefully the new open-source Quest 5.0 will be more easily adapted to become a robust multi-player platform.\n\nThere are always MUDs of course but from what I know they're quite a different beast to text adventures - I've never got the impression that they're particularly popular with the interactive fiction community.",
