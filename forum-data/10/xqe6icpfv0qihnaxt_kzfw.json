This isn't very nice to the server, because it generates an unnecessary random number, but seems worth it to make the code simpler (and behaves sanely if there are multiple exits, without having to make a special case for it).\r\n\r\nHere, we're getting a list of available exits and filtering it to see which of them inherit the `northdirection` type. In the previous example, I looked for exits whose alias is \"north\". These normally give the same result, but can differ.\r\n\r\nIn the previous example I set the player's location to the exit's destination; in this one I used `do` to run the script for the \"go\" command.
