The game state is saved, but not the text that has been generated during play.\n\nI confirmed this by:\n[list:fvyt57jg][*:fvyt57jg]Looking at the HTML source and establishing the text was not there, rather than merely hidden[/*:m:fvyt57jg]\n[*:fvyt57jg]Putting a one second delay on the above code, so the button is present when the game loaded, and the text was still not there[/*:m:fvyt57jg]\n[*:fvyt57jg]Creating a hide command that hides the save button, and confirming text is there for saves before the command is used, but not after; when reloaded the button reappears and text from that point on does get saved[/*:m:fvyt57jg][/list:u:fvyt57jg]\n\nI thought if I showed the button, waited a second before saving, then waited another second before hidding the button that might work, but no.
