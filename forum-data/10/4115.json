I'm trying to make a dungeon crawling adventure game with a variety of challenges, one that changes every time you play. For example, after defeating the first challenge (3 skeletons guarding a hallway) the player has choice between 3 different doors. I have several pages set up with a variety of challenges, monsters and traps for the most part, so that when they open one of the doors are presented with a challenge at random. Is there any way to do that?",
