      "EditableText": "Hello, people.\n\nToday, due to a small mistake, i placed a room inside a room and during test i saw the rom displayed in the &quot;Objects and Places&quot; pane. One idea did strike me: as i am actually making a game book, what if i place rooms in trees and add buttons to people click when the following room displays on the pane. I found it is not possible, but then i tested using objects and, as we all know, it worked just fine.\n\nMy point of view is that as a game book is not trying to simulate space, but just offering a succession of taking decisions, i could turn each decision into an Object (and object) and customize buttons as needed. So i would, for example, place a button named &quot;Analyze&quot; to tell player the implications and possible ways of that specific decision. Then a button for following that decision. I could also treat specific cases where i would create a button for each. \n\nI did nothing yet because my lack of experience on Quest may blind me to something crucial. So, changing the game now and realizing later that was not the best decision would be terrible for the process. Any comments about this option?",
