Is this possible or does the object or copies of the object have to then be moved to every other room I want it to be visible in?\n\nPart of the problem I'm having is also related to descriptions of some of the other rooms and objects in those rooms, since I have multiple descriptions meant to be dependent on the appearing object being visible or not.\n\nThanks.",

      "EditableText": "How about putting a script on each room the item appears in.\n Go to scripts before entering room,go to  objects, tick move object to current room, enter object required. If the object is initially set as invisible ,it will not appear in any room until your timer or whatever tells it to become visible. This means you only need one object. Of course if you wanted it to appear in all rooms , you could put the script in turn scripts.this does it every turn. Hope this works.",
