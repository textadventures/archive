However, I have read that you can create it again.  Is that in the “game” file of the tree to the left or do I have to type it for each and individual object?  Also where, once I create the command or verb “examine”, “ex” or “x”, do I write the description specifically for the objects?  Look at is in the “room” tab at the bottom.  Where would the print message for examine be?\n\n  When I write my stories I like to give as much description and detail as possible to the player so they know what something looks like.  I have to have a balance in my game for both fun and game play.  I understand it will be a lot of work to have almost every thing have a “look” and an “examine”.  I want each room to give basic description of what is most important when they walk in.  I want “look” to give a little more detail and if I feel the need I want it when “examine” is used to give the best possible description, meaning full detail.  Most likely 9 times out of 10 this will not effect a player unless a hint is given that it must be done to get out of a room.  But I want my players to know what the game will be if they choose.  They will still have to use their imagination, but I just want that extra something if they so desire.  Some people I am sure will not even bother examining anything unless it is part of a puzzle and which would be very rare and just try and rush through it, but I am hoping others will appreciate the work put forth into the game that there is some thing more to it.\n\n  Thank you.",

      "EditableText": "Yeah, examine and look are synonymous commands in Quest and most other text adventure games.\n\nI'm just doing this off of the top of my head, but if you're looking to make the examine command provide a more detailed description, it will involve a fair amount of typing, as you'll have to provide 2 different descriptions for every room, object and character in the game. And you'll have to make sure you make it clear to the player that the commands work differently in your game because many people are used to the standard uses of the look and examine commands.\n\nI don't see an examine command in the library elements, so I guess you can just create your own examine command, presumable with the command pattern &quot;examine #object#&quot;. Then I would have a script on the command that would display the alternate description. So, for example if you have the expanded description stored in an attribute called ext_desc, the script would be:\n\n[code:2ntyl001]msg (object&#46;ext_desc)[/code:2ntyl001]\n\nOr if you're not using the code editor, you'd select the Print Message script, choose &quot;expression&quot; from the dropdown box and then enter &quot;object.ext_desc&quot; in the text field.\n\nSo, it's not too difficult. You'd just have to remember to add the &quot;ext_desc&quot; attribute to all of the rooms and objects, and then add the description to that attribute. Of course, you can call the attribute whatever you want. Does that make sense?",
