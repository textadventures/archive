This crashes the game and Quest.\n\nAnd there is another bad issue. Running walkthroughs take are extrem long time. In Q52 it took nearly 10 seconds for my game, in Q5.3 I have to wait nearly a minute (only running time! Then you have the bug above where you have to wait  for minutes after the walkthrough has finished). This makes it impossible to use walkthroughs.",
