It does not, or at least it does not here in Chrome, Mozilla or IE (Windows 7) and IceWeasel (Linux). I've tried it with different mp3s and wavs and none of them work. I have also played someone else's game online that includes sound... and it works perfectly.\n\nSo as I see it, it can only be 2 things...\n1 - It's a peculiarity of the online editor which GitHub does suggest has been an issue in the past (I haven't as of yet tried the Windows offline editor as REALLY I wanted to run Linux and edit in the browser). Perhaps the uploaded audio file isn't in the same folder on the server as the test game or at the least something is happening to the filename once uploaded? (I used a very simple filename for this reason though)\n\n2 - I'm a twit and I'm doing something wrong.\n\nCode attached such as it is and I hope it IS number 2 as aside from this issue, I'm LOVIN' Quest.\nThanks in advance.... hope you can help <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
