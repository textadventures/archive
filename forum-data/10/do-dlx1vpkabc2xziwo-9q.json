It is \"locked\" until you hold a candle up to the wax seal. I want to use the candle as the \"key\"  and have it be triggered by the player typing something other than \"unlock with\". I'd be ok with \"use candle on\", but \"hold candle up to wax seal\" followed by \"the wax melts away\", and then being able to open it, would be nice. \"So far it isn't working at all. I can't get any command to unlock it. Any ideas? This is my first game.",

After melting the wax on the envelope, I would remove the 'envelope with wax' from the game (using 'remove object' script (or if you want to reseal the envelope, you can move the sealed envelope into the storage room)), and move the stained envelope (or whatever you want to call it) into the players inventory (using the 'move object' script).  It is the illusion that the sealed envelope and the stained one are the same when in fact they are two different objects.  You can put an 'open' verb on each and run scripts accordingly.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this is the avenue you want to pursue.  If not, there are alternatives to 'locking' and 'unlocking' objects.
