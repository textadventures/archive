When you enter a room, you get a message like:<br/>&quot;You are in the lounge.<br/>You can see a sofa, an apple, a newspaper, a table and a cupboard.<br/>You can go east or into the cupboard.&quot;<br/><br/>If you eat the apple, burn the newspaper or delete the east-exit with a script, so that the objects/exits are gone, you can still click the hyperlinks of the message. Is this a problem for Q5?",
