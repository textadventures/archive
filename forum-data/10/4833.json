Basically, you have a flag somewhere (in the room, on the player) like &quot;validcommand&quot; which is initially set to false. If they enter a good command, it gets set to true. Else it will remain false when the turn script occurs.\n\nThe turn script runs after each command. If the &quot;validcommand&quot; flag has not been set to true by a good command, then it knows a good command wasn't entered, and the player gets booted. If there can be multiple good commands in sequence (else the boot), then have the turn script do like this:\n\n[code:2w43w3s3]if (player&#46;validcommand) {\n    // player entered a valid command&#46; Set to false for next command&#46;\n    player&#46;validcommand = false\n    // Now it will go back and get the next command in the room&#46;\n} else {\n    // Player didn't enter a valid command&#46; Boot them&#46;\n    msg(&quot;Get out!&quot;)\n    player&#46;parent = outsideroom\n}[/code:2w43w3s3]\nJust set &quot;validcommand&quot; to false when entering the room and enable the turnscript.
