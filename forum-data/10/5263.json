I know how to increase the number, but is there a way that would stop it at a certain number but it still editable of which that max number is? For example let's say the max HP is 10 and the character is down to 5, but eats a healing item that restores 10 HP.  How can I have the item increase the attribute by 10 but stop the HP from going higher than the Max? That way in this case he/she would only heal 5 points, but later on how can I make it that his max then becomes twenty so if he/she is in the same situation they would now heal the full 10 points giving them 15?\n\nThe second issue is with a clock I was trying to get to work and I'm thinking whatever way to set max would help as it is displaying alright except when it gets past 00:59.
