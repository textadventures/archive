      "EditableText": "Is it possible you are disabling the timer before the timer has started running? When I use timers it allows me to stop the timer mid cycle as long as the timer has already started. For example I have a timer that every 30 seconds sends a message to the player. If I disable the timer it stops sending messages (no matter how many are left in the sequence). But, if the timer is disabled before the first 30 seconds (so the timer hasn't actually started yet) the disable timer doesn't work. \r\n\r\nCould you maybe give a more specific example of the issue so we could see if there is a way to work around your problem?",
