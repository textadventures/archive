      "EditableText": "I've had Quest sitting on my desktop for some while now and after a few dabbling attempts and trying to grapple with the core concepts, I think I'm ready to try making a quest. Quest is very attractive to me because of the GUI interface as I have only abstract knowledge of coding. With this in mind, I'm jumping in the deep end and building an adventure using a simplified d20 system. I have the adventure planned out, I just need help with some of the more advanced features of Quest.\n\n1st, at game start, I want the player to choose a weapon. Choosing a weapon will set player attributes, then kick them into the game proper. I've looked through the forums and found references to a 'show menu' function (which I have found) and an objectList function. I've looked and looked but can't for the life of me figure out how, using the GUI, to create an objectList container.\n\nLater on, I want to implement a combat system and I have a fair idea of how that might look, after that I think I may have all I need to get my adventure working.\n\nThanks in advance,\n~SkyLark",
