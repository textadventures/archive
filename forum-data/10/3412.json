What about typing in a (WALKTHROUGH) command to get the actual walkthrough for that location if you really are desperate to solve a situation in there. Then it's always at hand if you really want it. would this catch on?

The initial hints may be general or vague, but finally it will just tell you flat out what to do. But if you go to a different place in the game or are at a later point, you'll get different hints.
