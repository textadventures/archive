Otherwise, the XML parser tries to interpret what's inside your strings as part of the outer XML markup.<br/><br/>A simple example:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;function name=&quot;somefunc&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;<br/>    msg (&quot;&lt;font color=\\&quot;red\\&quot;&gt;Hello world&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)<br/>  &#93;&#93;&gt;<br/>&lt;/function&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>If you don't have the &lt;!CDATA[ ... ]]&gt; enclosing your script, you will get errors!<br/><br/>You should be able to use markup in your strings wherever you want (any sort of switch/if/whatever script) if you've escaped it properly.</blockquote><br/><br/>Ah, yes. Escaping; that's the phrase that was escaping me last night.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>jaynabonne wrote:</cite>A minor note: the &quot;font&quot; tag is considered deprecated and won't be supported in HTML5. You might be better off in the long run using a class for each character and then setting the class attributes in CSS rather than spreading the color info all through your strings:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;span class=&quot;Jimmy&quot;&gt;What the heck is going on here?&lt;/span&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;span class=&quot;Mary&quot;&gt;I don't know, but I think we should get a move on!&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>That way, if you decide to change the color (or any other part of the styling), you can change it in one place rather than every string in the game.</blockquote><br/><br/>Even though I'm not OP, this little tidbit is very good to know for the future.",
