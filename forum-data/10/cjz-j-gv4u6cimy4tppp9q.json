Some tags (such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) will be assumed to have a corresponding closing tag immediately before the next tag of the same type if they aren't properly paired; while others (such as <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>) may have the implicit closing tag added before the end of the containing element. Unfortunately, there are some edge cases that vary between different browsers. Last time I checked, <code>&lt;b&gt;this&lt;i&gt;is&lt;/b&gt;invalid&lt;/i&gt;</code> might be magically converted to any of <code>&lt;b&gt;this&lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;invalid&lt;/i&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;b&gt;this&lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;invalid&lt;/b&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;b&gt;this&lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;invalid</code> depending on your browser.</p>\n\n",
