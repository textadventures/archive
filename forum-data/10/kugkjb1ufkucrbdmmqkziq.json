When you're adding scripts (run as script -> add new script) in the GUI/Editor, in its scripting window in the middle of the screen, it also has the note-paper like button too, but this is to just see (and if need, edit too) the individual code chunk of this small part of your game (it's NOT your entire game code).\r\n\r\nif you can't get into the GUI/Editor (your game file doesn't compile), then there's ONLY the method of right clicking on your game file, and opening it with a text editor software, to get into your game code, so you can then fix up your game's code, so it works (compiles) and you can get back into the GUI/Editor and/or play your game again.\r\n\r\nwhen programming there's different aspects of code (or via through using the GUI/Editor if not coding directly) errors:\r\n\r\n1. 'compiling errors' are errors can prevent the compiling of the game (there's wrong code/syntax/etc that prevents the game code/content from being even able to be read: imagine a baby trying to write a book, it would just be garbled/scribbly non-sense, compared to typos on some of the pages' various sentences of the book) into the GUI/Editor (which includes not being able to play the game)\r\n2. individual 'logic and/or syntax errors' that don't interfere with compiling, are errors that don't prevent the compiling of the game into the GUI/Editor and with playing the game, however, they will cause that stuff to not work when playing the game (oops I messed up scripting that effects some game mechanic, action/event, feature, but it doesn't prevent the game from compiling, I still can open the game in the GUI/Editor and still play the game). You can play most of your game, but some, parts or stuff, of your game will have bugs/not-work/not-work-properly.\r\n3. same as above, but it breaks the game, it will compile and you can get into the GUI/Editor and successfully get it to open into the playing the game, but you can't actually play your game, as the errors break the entire game from working as you want it to (for example, you could be stuck in the intro or character creation at the start of your game, unable to progress past it, due to your messed up scripting of it. Or, another example, every main aspect of your game is broken, nothing works in your game, lol).\r\n4. 'crashes/freezing' (can fall under all of the above) are memory errors: usually you just messed up and have an infinite loop (resources are finite, infinite loops are not: your computer/quest runs out of memory and crashes, as it has to store that information involved with/for the looping, and infinitely storing information, exceeds the finite amount of space/memory/resources of a computer). Most/all crashes from software and/or the OS now are contained, so it doesn't destroy your computer (this wasn't the case with the first/early/original computers). That said, infinite loops are still bad (but not harmful), you must fix them, or else your quest game will continue to crash. The worst causes of crashes are 'memory leaks' and/or  'dangling pointers', though as I said usually (most/all) the OS and/or software protects by containing and cleans-up/repairs/restores the lost memory from actually being lost to the computer itself which would destroy your computer.\r\n\r\nan example of an infinite loop:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<game name=\"infinite_loop_example\">\r\n  <attr name=\"start\" type=\"script\">\r\n    infinite_loop_hi_function\r\n  </attr>\r\n</game>\r\n\r\n<function name=\"infinite_loop_hi_function\">\r\n  msg (\"hi\")\r\n  infinite_loop_hi_function\r\n</function>\r\n```\r\n\r\nas you can hopefully see, there's no way to get out of (to end/escape from) the function, it just keeps outputting 'hi' to the screen (processors are extremely fast, it'll crash quest before you can blink).\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nnever fear errors, as this is the majority of your time programming, even of professional programmers, welcome to programming, lol: trouble-shooting your code of errors you made, laughs.
