      "EditableText": "Yesterday, I discovered that I'd been caught out by a feature of SAVE that I'd encountered before, and brought up before, but didn't resolve at the time. The SAVE operation during play performs some code checks that are not done by PLAY or PUBLISH, meaning that some code faults in published games are only reported when SAVE is used. Is there a problem with the same checks being added to PLAY or at least to PUBLISH?\r\n\r\nIn making the change, I also noticed that PUBLISH works on the last saved version of a game. So, if I go in in to make a minor change and don't save, no change will occur. Could PUBLISH check if changes have occurred in the open .aslx game and prompt for a save, or simply save and publish automatically?\r\n\r\nThis game, like my others, allows for the MAP, GAME PANES and HYPERLINKS to be switched on and off dynamically. The default setting is 'map on', 'links on' and 'panes off'. When resuming play after a SAVE, however, the panes appear! Is there a work around for this problem?\r\n\r\nIn introducing dynamic game panes last May, it was discovered that there was a problem with white space calculation when the panes were taken out, and a large gap often appeared. K.V. (I think) provided the following code which seemed to work at the time but is not working now and indeed seems to make matters worse! To see the effect, run the game (http://play2.textadventures.co.uk/Play.aspx?id=m4a7-u7kyukbtvhaqtxq-g) and type PANES twice.\r\n```\r\nJS.eval (\"var reHeight = 0;  $('#divOutput').children().each(function(){reHeight += $(this).height();});  $('#divOutput').css('min-height',reHeight);\")\r\n```\r\nIn experimenting, I also noticed for the first time that SAVE online no longer saves away the dialogue? I'm not sure when that came in, but seems an okay limitation, presumably to help with the timeout problem online?",
