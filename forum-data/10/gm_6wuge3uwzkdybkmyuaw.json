Newbie to quest and I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out how to make and approach function that takes you to an object/ room (you can't move to another room until you use the out button) but are able to do other \"actions\"? an unescapable room would be helpful too.\r\nand with continue making it so you are able to do some actions until a timer runs out and you move onto a new text or room (like back to the start) but keep some of the things you have done like a respawn. any help would be appreciated!
