Changing the UnrecognisedCommand-template does work. \nI want to get rid of the &quot;You are in a room.&quot; message when you enter a room and sometimes replace it with something like &quot;There's a lever.&quot; So, this would be my requests, for one to change the message when you enter the room and for the other to not show a message at all.\n\n\nEDIT: Alright, changing the youarein-template does work, just not in the first room. But I can't get rid of the youarein just replace it with something. If I leave it empty it says &quot;True a room.&quot; And I can't get rid of the &quot;a room.&quot; too. Please, could somebody help. The &quot;You are in a room.&quot; is pretty much messing up the game i'm envisioning.",
