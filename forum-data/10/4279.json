Visible won't work with this. This is needed because if i move towards him i want the player to die sooner than if you walked away from his location. <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->\nThanks for your help!",

here too.<br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>nevermind, here's the &quot;noobie&quot; links for you:<br/><br/>some useful links for you:<br/><br/>01. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Main_Page\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Main_Page</a><!-- m --><br/>02. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Tutorial\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Tutorial</a><!-- m --><br/>03. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/How_to\">http://quest5.net/wiki/How_to</a><!-- m --> (guides)<br/>04. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Showing_a_menu\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Showing_a_menu</a><!-- m --><br/>05. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Character_Creation\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Character_Creation</a><!-- m --><br/>06. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Category:All_Functions_and_Script_Commands\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Category:All_Fun ... t_Commands</a><!-- m --> (page 1, range: A-S)<br/>07. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/w/index.php?title=Category:All_Functions_and_Script_Commands&amp;pagefrom=Set#mw-pages\">http://quest5.net/w/index.php?title=Cat ... t#mw-pages</a><!-- m --> (page 2, range: S-Z)<br/>08. <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=18\">viewforum.php?f=18</a><!-- l --> (more guides: libraries and code)<br/>09. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Object_element\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Object_element</a><!-- m --><br/>10. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Attribute_Types\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Attribute_Types</a><!-- m --><br/>11. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Category:ASLX_Elements\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Category:ASLX_Elements</a><!-- m --><br/>12. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/ASLX_Elements\">http://quest5.net/wiki/ASLX_Elements</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>the two most powerful scripts:<br/><br/>in GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>'Setting or Changing an Attribute (or a variable)' Script&#058;<br/><br/>run as script -&gt;

light)<br/>holy = unholy // (holy ---&gt; unholy)<br/>unholy = holy // (unholy ---&gt; holy)<br/><br/>monster.elemental = &quot;fire&quot;<br/>spell.elemental = &quot;water&quot;<br/><br/>(common game elemental affinity concepts: 'strong' = damage is halved, 'weak' = damage is either doubled or x1.5, 'immune' = no damage, 'reflected' = damage is done back upon the caster, 'absorbed' = damage heals the target)<br/><br/>you cast a water spell on the fire monster (it's 'weak' to your water spell, thus we want to code it so that you'll do double the normal damage of the spell):<br/><br/>if (monster.elemental = StringDictionaryItem (global_data_object.opposing_elemental_string_dictionary, spell.elemental)) {<br/>// if (monster:fire = opposing elemental of spell:water) {<br/>// string dictionary's opposing elemental of water is 'spell:water -&gt;

string:<br/><br/><pre><code>the wise owl Object's 'inquire about' (custom~self-made) Verb&#58;<br/><br/>show menu (&quot;What topic?&quot;, split (&quot;dragon;sword;princess&quot;, &quot;;&quot;), false) {<br/>  // you choose&#58;

It's on the toolbar in the GUi and looks like a piece of paper with writing on it. Click that and you can paste in everything above to get the whole game (or parts of it, but you have to be more careful that it'll work with code you already have). \n\nThere are two main parts to this, the start script which creates all the rooms, and the turnscript which moves slenderman to chase the player. It's not a very fair chase at the moment since slenderman homes in like the terminator <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->. But you can mess with that as you like. \n\nAs you can see in the turnscript, I compare the player's coordinates to slenderman's (note that [i:300zb77u]game.pov[/i:300zb77u] is a way of saying 'player'), and I use that to move slenderman toward the player. \n\nBtw, the '//' is just a comment line, so Quest ignores it. I just use it to divide sections of the code. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions/problems.",

It's on the toolbar in the GUi and looks like a piece of paper with writing on it. Click that and you can paste in everything above to get the whole game (or parts of it, but you have to be more careful that it'll work with code you already have). <br/><br/>There are two main parts to this, the start script which creates all the rooms, and the turnscript which moves slenderman to chase the player. It's not a very fair chase at the moment since slenderman homes in like the terminator <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->. But you can mess with that as you like. <br/><br/>As you can see in the turnscript, I compare the player's coordinates to slenderman's (note that <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">game.pov</span> is a way of saying 'player'), and I use that to move slenderman toward the player. <br/><br/>Btw, the '//' is just a comment line, so Quest ignores it. I just use it to divide sections of the code. <br/><br/>Let me know if you have any questions/problems.",

      "EditableText": "Shmabz, I like Jay's idea better of adding all the rooms to a list then selecting from that. How you would do that depends on whether you already have the rooms in a list.\n\nIf you have them in a list, you need a new copy of the list, so just newList = oldLIst. \n\nIf you don't have them in a list, you [i:18w1d1hn]could [/i:18w1d1hn]do it by hand.  But that sounds kind of tedious, so I think this would work:\n\n[code:18w1d1hn]\nmyRoomList = NewObjectList()\nforeach (obj, AllObjects()) {\n  if (DoesInherit(obj, &quot;editor_room&quot;) = true) {\n    list add (myRoomList, obj)\n  }\n}\n[/code:18w1d1hn]\n\nAs you can see, that code says, &quot;for each object in the game see if it's a room, and if it is add it to my list of rooms&quot;. Note that this really only works at the start of the game for reasons I won't go into here. \n\nNow to do the random placement of things, you'll work with this myRoomList. You want to select a random item from this list. You do that by counting the number of items in the list and choosing a random number no greater than that [i:18w1d1hn]minus one[/i:18w1d1hn]. Then you select the item at that number position in the list. \n\nTo count a list, <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/ListCount\">http://quest5.net/wiki/ListCount</a><!-- m -->\nTo choose a random number, <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/GetRandomInt\">http://quest5.net/wiki/GetRandomInt</a><!-- m -->\n\nWhy is the minus one important? Because when you check the positions of items in Quest lists (and really most lists in programming) you always start from 0. So, if a list has two items, the first item is at position 0, and the second item is at position 1 -- not position 1 and position 2 as you might intuitively think. \n\nTo select an item from an ObjectList, <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/ObjectListItem\">http://quest5.net/wiki/ObjectListItem</a><!-- m -->\n\nAfter you select this item, you want to remove it from the list. To do that, <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/List_remove\">http://quest5.net/wiki/List_remove</a><!-- m --> . \n\nThen you just repeat the steps for every thing. Count the list, choose a random number, select, and remove.",

How you would do that depends on whether you already have the rooms in a list.<br/><br/>If you have them in a list, you need a new copy of the list, so just newList = oldLIst. <br/><br/>If you don't have them in a list, you <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">could </span>do it by hand.  But that sounds kind of tedious, so I think this would work:<br/><br/><pre><code><br/>myRoomList = NewObjectList()<br/>foreach (obj, AllObjects()) {<br/>  if (DoesInherit(obj, &quot;editor_room&quot;) = true) {<br/>    list add (myRoomList, obj)<br/>  }<br/>}<br/></code></pre><br/><br/>As you can see, that code says, &quot;for each object in the game see if it's a room, and if it is add it to my list of rooms&quot;. Note that this really only works at the start of the game for reasons I won't go into here. <br/><br/>Now to do the random placement of things, you'll work with this myRoomList. You want to select a random item from this list. You do that by counting the number of items in the list and choosing a random number no greater than that <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">minus one</span>. Then you select the item at that number position in the list. <br/><br/>To count a list, <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/ListCount\">http://quest5.net/wiki/ListCount</a><!-- m --><br/>To choose a random number, <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/GetRandomInt\">http://quest5.net/wiki/GetRandomInt</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>Why is the minus one important? Because when you check the positions of items in Quest lists (and really most lists in programming) you always start from 0. So, if a list has two items, the first item is at position 0, and the second item is at position 1 -- not position 1 and position 2 as you might intuitively think. <br/><br/>To select an item from an ObjectList, <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/ObjectListItem\">http://quest5.net/wiki/ObjectListItem</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>After you select this item, you want to remove it from the list. To do that, <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/List_remove\">http://quest5.net/wiki/List_remove</a><!-- m --> . <br/><br/>Then you just repeat the steps for every thing. Count the list, choose a random number, select, and remove.",

I've managed to get the landmarks to be places randomly as well as the 8 pages to choose between 10 landmarks to be their parents, with none choosing the same parent. I have also remove the coordinate system with slenderman and got it so if he is 2 blocks away the player is issued a warning saying he is nearby, but not the exact coordinates. Now it's just fiddling with the scoring and end of the game, thanks so much everyone!! Btw, do you want me to put your display names from this website in the Author section, or are there any other names you want?:D",
