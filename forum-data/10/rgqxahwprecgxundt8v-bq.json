There are probable ways to do this by creating a monitoring object, and having it tick down .. then add that to a list, for all the doors... But that means a lot of management code to ensure I don't add the same thing to the list etc etc.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd really like to be able to do is this in the door.open script:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// So long as we're not already closing\r\nif (not this.isclosing = true) {\r\n // note that we now are\r\n  this.isclosing = true\r\n  // ... in 5 seconds\r\n   SetTimeoutID(5) {\r\n    // ...close the door\r\n     do(this,\"closescript\")\r\n     // ...note that we're no longer closing\r\n     this.isclosing = false\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```     \r\ni.e.   the door remains  open for 5 seconds, and then closes.  If anyone attempts to re-run the open script, it's protected from creating yet another close timer....\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the \"this\" reference is not recognised.. and I can't think of a way to easily 'store' the \"this\" reference except in an above-mentioned list of object names which needs to be managed....\r\n\r\nAnyone got any good ideas on how you can do this?  In fact, since the SetTimeout and timers can't seem to have any form of variable passed into them at creation time, and I can't see a way to 'eval' a string into a script, to 'bake' the name in...  \r\n\r\nHelp! :)\r\n\r\n",
