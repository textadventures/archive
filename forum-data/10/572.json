All of this is going quite well, except for unfortunately if someone uses a single percent sign % in string of text they type in, it crashes the server. \n\nI know this is caused due to Quest not finding the other % sign to close off the assumed numeric variable, but the problem is that I know Quest can print such symbols. \n\nWe know this because the default say command hardcoded into Questnet will allow you to message any kind of symbol you want(so far that I've tried) to other players. So somehow Quest is capable of storing and interpretting the symbols but it's hardcoded. Is there a fix to this you can start working on for the next version perhaps? Is this possibly a bug? I only think it's a big deal because well, in a text game, you need to have no limit to the assortment of text you can use, and this does include characters and symbols outside of the alpha-numeric spectrum.\n\nHere's what Questnet spits out in the script log...\n\nLine parameter &lt;User.RNETitlePreview[userid];  $removeformatting(Using percent signs crashes quest see % ?)$&gt; has missing %\n\n\nSome sort of response to this would be greatly appreciated.",
