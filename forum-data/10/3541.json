It's simple and accessible, and I think that's what people like about it. I guess.\nSo, what's the first person shooter for IF? Probably your standard &quot;stick this item with that item and use it on this thingy&quot; puzzle sort of game, which always works great. There's a lot to love there, and saying that that's a staple of IF would be like saying that air is a staple of my diet.\nIs that what we would want to make a flagship game for Quest? Would we want to include a battle system? Branching story lines Walking Dead style?\nAre we going to have a character stand out that we can champion as a mascot, or are we going to play to the strengths of IF and create a game in which the main character is some extension of the player?\nWhat's a good setting?

Before too much text pops up, give the player an option to respond.  The response's impact for the player was always aesthetic: somewhere down the line someone would say something slightly different based on your response, but everything mostly stayed the same.  The same strategy could be employed outside of conversation with options that represent actions instead of responses.\nI bring this up because, like most people within this community, I write short stories in my free time and that tends to reflect on my writing in the game.  But because even the most avid IF player might get frustrated or bored with walls of text, I needed to find a way to break up the long plot exposition, and now we could use this strategy in our game to have as much story as fits the game, without having to curb the colorful detail or make a game with a story that's centered more around the player's actions than an over-arching narrative (should we decide that we want to).[/quote:p019yffs]\n\n[quote=&quot;HegemonKhan&quot;:p019yffs]just a quick comment (and most of you already know this too), but it's a good comment (I think anyways) on how great quest is:\n\nIn my limited knowledge of coding, it seems that quest can for the most part, make an elder scroll quality of game (for a text adventure game's abilities of course), that's the power of quest's coding. You can code in all of the elements of an elder scroll game. So, as been said over and over, the problem isn't with quest, it just doesn't have great games to showcase the power of quest's capabilities. We just need some really great games and big advertising of them (and of quest), to get the reknown and fame that quest deserves.\n\n--------------\n\nI'm not a writer nor a game maker, but my &quot;two cents&quot; on the story aspect:\n\nI think for the most part, dialogue should be at most a paragraph, as reading only ~5 sentences constantly throughout the game isn't that big of a deal, especially with game play spacing. This way, you can spread out your story, while still telling an epic story.\n\nObviously, here and there, you can have some major events in your game, where you can have a much longer dialogue, and a good example would be after a hard boss fight or a very difficult or long puzzle. That way, the game player sees it as a reward, and eagerly reads the long dialogue, compared to as a punishment, if you just have the long dialogue without a huge effort to receive it, resulting in the game player &quot;grumbing&quot; at having to read it.\n\nmaybe think of it as like a movie, you need to alternate back and forth between watching action and listening to dialogue, it's the same for a game.\n\nThe prologue (using the start script) is good place to set up your story, if it's their first time, they can read it (if they want), or if it is not their first time (or if they just don't want to read it ~ and stumble through the game blindly lol), you can skip it.\n\nAlso, any long dialogue of epic story telling, should have an option to skip it, especially if it's the same everytime, again for game player's who're replaying the game and already read it, or for those who just don't want to read it, lol.[/quote:p019yffs]",

It is currently called [b:3d8hxhvc]Trillion: Redshift[/b:3d8hxhvc].\n\nIt doesn't hurt my feelings at all if this doesn't meet anyone's expectations or pique any interest. Hope you like it.\n\n[b:3d8hxhvc]Here is a pitch and summary primer:[/b:3d8hxhvc]\n\nIn the human heart, the stars represent hope. Our future. And maybe; our purpose. \n\nWith humanity’s numbers reaching critical mass, a rapid expansion becomes the only realistic approach to overpopulation. You are chosen as a special operative to aid the expansionist military forces in a desperate and aggressive campaign to secure new territory and recognition among the various species vying for influence over the Milky Way galaxy. \n\nWhat started out as a war with a singular purpose increasingly becomes a battle of political intrigue, deception, fear, and unfathomable consequences. \n\nBecause trust is a fickle animal - for your oldest enemy can earn your most sincere pity\nand your closest allies can be the greatest threat to your species’ survival. \n\n[b:3d8hxhvc]Summary Pitch:[/b:3d8hxhvc]\n\nA multitude of species hold sway over the galaxy's present and future. Humanity is a young species, compared to some who have been at war with one another since before our species evolved. We won't make a lot of friends, forcing our way into the controlled territories of our neighbors, but we have little choice.\n\nWar breaks out, but things quickly become complicated. We initially believed the greatest threat would come from those who opposed our species' expansion. But there is more to the galactic facade than meets the eye. \n\nThe player will find, through their campaign, that the galaxy holds many secrets, and our species may play an integral role in saving the Milky Way from something that goes deeper into its past than anyone ever imagined.\n\n\n[b:3d8hxhvc]Please read all details in the specie's summaries in the picture, as the plotline summaries afterwards will not make much sense.[/b:3d8hxhvc]\n[i:3d8hxhvc]This picture is large so I've given an imageshack link instead of embedding the picture within the post.[/i:3d8hxhvc]\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3553/rtsstrategygame.png\">http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3553 ... gygame.png</a><!-- m -->\n\nMajor plotline: BOELTOCKS\n\n-The Boeltocks have begun to use the Dire species as a biological weapon. No one yet knows, but they are using Dire infections on planets as a means to gain a vast wealth. When a planet shows signs of infection, the Boeltocks swoop in offering the weapons that they have developed over centuries of fighting the Dire, to eliminate the infestation. They charge exorbitant sums for the assistance, gaining a massive profit from each planet cleared.\n\nMain plotline: TOX\n\n- The Tox, known for being reclusive and aggressive, have suddenly declared peace with their enemy’s, and are attempting to initiate diplomacy. A small group of Tox individuals suddenly burst onto the scene, warning the other species that this diplomacy is a façade.\n\nThey explain that the Tox were long ago consumed by a species of parasitic alien that has taken control of their minds and bodies. Only one small population of Tox on a single planet has managed to remain hidden and clean. They explain that the parasites have not spread to other species simply because the individual matriarch that controls them is taxed to her limit. She cannot control very many more individuals.\n\nHowever, she has a hunger for expanding her influence. So instead, she has used the Tox mind puppets to wage war on other species, and physically bully her way into expanding her control. This obviously did not work, as the Tox were not as overwhelmingly powerful as she had hoped, and the other species have halted their aggression and pushed them back to the breaking point.\n\nBeing forced to come up with another strategy, the Matriarch spent years trying to find a way to continue expanding her influence. She finally has found the key to expanding her abilities to control more minds. Now, the Tox, whom the other species simply think were militaristic, and have no idea that they are being controlled, are now initiating diplomacy. Where war failed, they intend to mingle, and spread the parasite to the other species.\n\n\nMain plotline: FURIONS\n\n-The Furions are an ancient species. They once had a vast territory around 1.6 Billion years ago. They went from one of the most populous species to, seemingly, extinct in just a matter of years. A remnant population has survived on a planet near human territory. The population will be discovered by the player, as a remnant that has been parasitized by some creature. The creatures inside the hosts reproduce and die in cycles, but each generation renews the host tissues and repair damage. This has literally made the hosts immortal, even though the parasites are not. A side effect of the parasite is that the higher brain functions are entirely blocked, making the host feral.\n\nWhen the player inadvertently cures a specimen, the species has a chance to awaken from this curse. Soon, it is revealed that this hyper-advanced species, and all others from their time, were wiped out by a single enemy species. \n\nThe Accretions begin to come out of their enigmatic and reclusive shell, and take an interest in the rediscovery of the Furion.\n\nThe Furion recognize the Accretions as a species from their cycle known to them as Regius. Something does not add up, to the Furion, as they watched the Regius be wiped out by the species that would eventually also spell their own doom. More comes to light as the player pushes their way into Tox/Cinn territory to discover the Cinn matriarch. The Furions suddenly realize that the Cinn were another species from their cycle. The Cinn were the first species to be eliminated by the species that cleansed the galaxy during their cycle. \n\nThe Cinn matriarchs have an ability to take on the form of a creature that has been absorbed. With this knowledge, the Furion realize that the parasite infection that attacked them was a repurposed Cinn creature that was used against them – however, the parasites operated unexpectedly, allowing a population of Furions to survive, unbeknownst to their enemy.\n\nThis seems like a one in a million chance, causing the Furion to speculate that the Regius/Accretions were, in fact, wiped out by the enemy species 1.6 million years ago. The Accretions of this cycle are imposters that have assumed the appearance of the Regius. The obliterators of all life from 1.6 million years ago have been hiding in plain sight since the beginning of recorded time.\n\nEveryone knew how advanced the Accretions were, and that the species took a guiding role in the advancement of all other sentient species, but no one knew of their sinister intentions, which, with their identity revealed, will come to light earlier than they had intended.",

You are chosen as a special operative to aid the expansionist military forces in a desperate and aggressive campaign to secure new territory and recognition among the various species vying for influence over the Milky Way galaxy. <br/><br/>What started out as a war with a singular purpose increasingly becomes a battle of political intrigue, deception, fear, and unfathomable consequences. <br/><br/>Because trust is a fickle animal - for your oldest enemy can earn your most sincere pity<br/>and your closest allies can be the greatest threat to your species’ survival. <br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Summary Pitch:</span><br/><br/>A multitude of species hold sway over the galaxy's present and future. Humanity is a young species, compared to some who have been at war with one another since before our species evolved. We won't make a lot of friends, forcing our way into the controlled territories of our neighbors, but we have little choice.<br/><br/>War breaks out, but things quickly become complicated. We initially believed the greatest threat would come from those who opposed our species' expansion. But there is more to the galactic facade than meets the eye. <br/><br/>The player will find, through their campaign, that the galaxy holds many secrets, and our species may play an integral role in saving the Milky Way from something that goes deeper into its past than anyone ever imagined.<br/><br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Please read all details in the specie's summaries in the picture, as the plotline summaries afterwards will not make much sense.</span><br/><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">This picture is large so I've given an imageshack link instead of embedding the picture within the post.</span><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3553/rtsstrategygame.png\">http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3553 ... gygame.png</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>Major plotline: BOELTOCKS<br/><br/>-The Boeltocks have begun to use the Dire species as a biological weapon. No one yet knows, but they are using Dire infections on planets as a means to gain a vast wealth. When a planet shows signs of infection, the Boeltocks swoop in offering the weapons that they have developed over centuries of fighting the Dire, to eliminate the infestation. They charge exorbitant sums for the assistance, gaining a massive profit from each planet cleared.<br/><br/>Main plotline: TOX<br/><br/>- The Tox, known for being reclusive and aggressive, have suddenly declared peace with their enemy’s, and are attempting to initiate diplomacy. A small group of Tox individuals suddenly burst onto the scene, warning the other species that this diplomacy is a façade.<br/><br/>They explain that the Tox were long ago consumed by a species of parasitic alien that has taken control of their minds and bodies. Only one small population of Tox on a single planet has managed to remain hidden and clean. They explain that the parasites have not spread to other species simply because the individual matriarch that controls them is taxed to her limit. She cannot control very many more individuals.<br/><br/>However, she has a hunger for expanding her influence. So instead, she has used the Tox mind puppets to wage war on other species, and physically bully her way into expanding her control. This obviously did not work, as the Tox were not as overwhelmingly powerful as she had hoped, and the other species have halted their aggression and pushed them back to the breaking point.<br/><br/>Being forced to come up with another strategy, the Matriarch spent years trying to find a way to continue expanding her influence. She finally has found the key to expanding her abilities to control more minds. Now, the Tox, whom the other species simply think were militaristic, and have no idea that they are being controlled, are now initiating diplomacy. Where war failed, they intend to mingle, and spread the parasite to the other species.<br/><br/><br/>Main plotline: FURIONS<br/><br/>-The Furions are an ancient species. They once had a vast territory around 1.6 Billion years ago. They went from one of the most populous species to, seemingly, extinct in just a matter of years. A remnant population has survived on a planet near human territory. The population will be discovered by the player, as a remnant that has been parasitized by some creature. The creatures inside the hosts reproduce and die in cycles, but each generation renews the host tissues and repair damage. This has literally made the hosts immortal, even though the parasites are not. A side effect of the parasite is that the higher brain functions are entirely blocked, making the host feral.<br/><br/>When the player inadvertently cures a specimen, the species has a chance to awaken from this curse. Soon, it is revealed that this hyper-advanced species, and all others from their time, were wiped out by a single enemy species. <br/><br/>The Accretions begin to come out of their enigmatic and reclusive shell, and take an interest in the rediscovery of the Furion.<br/><br/>The Furion recognize the Accretions as a species from their cycle known to them as Regius. Something does not add up, to the Furion, as they watched the Regius be wiped out by the species that would eventually also spell their own doom. More comes to light as the player pushes their way into Tox/Cinn territory to discover the Cinn matriarch. The Furions suddenly realize that the Cinn were another species from their cycle. The Cinn were the first species to be eliminated by the species that cleansed the galaxy during their cycle. <br/><br/>The Cinn matriarchs have an ability to take on the form of a creature that has been absorbed. With this knowledge, the Furion realize that the parasite infection that attacked them was a repurposed Cinn creature that was used against them – however, the parasites operated unexpectedly, allowing a population of Furions to survive, unbeknownst to their enemy.<br/><br/>This seems like a one in a million chance, causing the Furion to speculate that the Regius/Accretions were, in fact, wiped out by the enemy species 1.6 million years ago. The Accretions of this cycle are imposters that have assumed the appearance of the Regius. The obliterators of all life from 1.6 million years ago have been hiding in plain sight since the beginning of recorded time.<br/><br/>Everyone knew how advanced the Accretions were, and that the species took a guiding role in the advancement of all other sentient species, but no one knew of their sinister intentions, which, with their identity revealed, will come to light earlier than they had intended.",

They would lead and direct the expansion into enemy territories. I felt, however, that for a text adventure, a commander would be too distant and unable to explore the worlds, rather than invade them.\n\nSo for this, I changed the identity of the player into a special operative that is a scout of sorts, leading the push of the expansion, and being the first to explore and experience everything that happens in this universe. This would also allow the player to support the expansionist forces, without having to worry about the burdens of having to manage such a high-level position, if you will.\n\nSo, as you mentioned, the player would be A LOT like Shepard in Mass Effect, in how they go about doing things in this universe. Although, instead of constant battles, there would be more strategy, puzzles, and story packed into every inch of gameplay.\n\nAt least, this is my initial impression and thought process.\n\n\n======================\n\nEdit: So I had an idea for a &quot;mission&quot; that would be a who-dun-it essentially. The player is in a facility that is slowly being infested. A camera catches someone becoming infested by a Cinn creature that controls their mind. Think of john Carpenter's &quot;The Thing&quot;. The player will have to find out who is parasitized and who is human, and try to stem the tide of infections to eliminate it.\n\nAlso, I contemplated the possibility of the player playing from multiple POV's. Perhaps, the player could also play as the Matriarch of the Cinn. After their discovery, the player can control her in her attempt to spread her influence. Therefore, in this mission, she could take control of various different people, and attempt to infect this facility and prevent people from stopping her until she controls everyone in this facility. So the idea above would be switched around.\n\nJust wanted to throw that out there as an idea for a mission within this game. This type of mission would prevent having to have much of a combat system, as it is an alternative to battling in a way, but still forces tension and gives the player a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother example mission is the one where the player discovers the Furions, and helps revive them, bringing a whole new and ancient species back in to the galactic picture. \n\nSo those are a few ideas of how it could play out, in a system like in Mass Effect where the player can visit planets and then &quot;land&quot; on the planets for missions like these.",

      "EditableText": "I told you guys I'd post if I got an idea, and a large-scale type idea popped into my head and it's been taking shape, so I figured I'd stick it up here to let you guys look at it.\n\n  It's a fairly direct combination of Minecraft and Terraria, and I keep touching on ideas that closely resemble Dwarf Fortress, too.  As in the mentioned games, the player would begin alone, with nothing but the clothes on their back in some relatively non-threatening environment (let's say a peaceful meadow).  From this starting point they can travel in all directions except for southerly ones--more on that later, as that's more story-based.  When a player travels in one of these directions they are taken to a location that is named for its environmental type (&quot;biome&quot; if you will).  These locations function as larger, overworld-like locations.  Think of it as the difference between World 1 and World 2 in the Mario games.  Anyway, these &quot;biome&quot; locations contain several (ideally it would be completely random, so none to many) landmarks and dungeons that can be interacted with in practical ways.  If I'm losing you, read the next paragraph and see if you get it.\n\n\n  You start in a meadow and see that your compass buttons are lit up on all the directions that have no southern component.  You chose to go north.  You are told that you have entered a savanna, and that you haven't explored it.  You type &quot;explore&quot; and the game tells you that you've found a mine shaft dug into the ground (you might later notice, upon travelling back to this savanna, that this exact mine shaft has been added to a list of places you can go to within the savanna).  You opt to enter the mine shaft.  Inside you find a few materials that aren't useful to you at the moment, because you've only just started, and then you encounter a creature.  It begins to attack you, and you are unarmed and unarmored, so you flee back to the main savanna.  You then type &quot;explore&quot; again and are told that you find an abandoned ranch.  Inside the abandoned ranch you find your first tool, a wooden hoe (or maybe something more original) which will allow you to grow food to heal yourself.  You also take note of the fact that the game offers you the option of repairing the ranch at the cost of lumber and other materials, none of which you have the slightest idea how to get (but hopefully the prospect intrigues you).\n\n\n  So the player finds these places, and explores them, and finds things to make more things, or better things, or change other things.  There would several different &quot;biome&quot; types, and an important note is that the further you explore from your original meadow, the more challenging encounters with hostile creatures should become.  On top of that, once you really start to travel, the types of &quot;biomes&quot; you'll encounter will start to change.  We're moving away from Minecraft now and towards Terraria.  If not at first, upon travelling further you may find that you're running into mountain biomes, or canyon biomes.  And a bit further perahps hellish biomes and/or magical biomes.  All of these different places would not only offer different challenges and scenery (you know, the imagery kind), but they would also offer new resources which you might want to take back to the more familiar places to use on projects.\n\n  Back to Minecraft, briefly.  It would be beneficial if the player could create buildings for themselves, to give them something to do with all that crazy loot they're bringing in.  Now, this is a text adventure still, so telling the player that they've built a castle and it's floating only goes so far when you can't look at it or show it to your friends, so these buildings would benefit a lot from being more practical.  Perhaps the player, upon massing enough resources, could create a ranch like the one they found (especially provided they haven't found one, either due to bad luck or that one was never randomly created).  Perhaps they could make a store, and travelers would come to barter at it, allowing the player to trade resources they've found in abundance for others that they need.  Perhaps they would build a floating castle--powered by some magical resources they've found in their travels--to protect them from...\n\n  About not being able to go south at the start; you have been exiled from your previous country of residence.  We can come up with a reason or leave it ambiguous Elder Scrolls style, it isn't important.  What is important is that you can't travel in that direction at all, but things tend to come from there.  At first, maybe it's just a bandit.  Then maybe it's a few.  Then there are raiding parties, mercenaries.  Maybe armies come eventually, and it is only you and the marvelous wonders you collected, created, and built that must fend off these attackers--or run from them.  Or instead of exile, you are a refugee.  Your home has been decimated by a large influx of monsters, and you have fled to this place alone.  There's less mystery to why monsters are attacking you, but maybe if we're going for a simpler story that would be a better option.\n\n  As for an ending, there isn't one.  Perhaps once the player has traveled beyond the most unforgiving and hellish landscapes there are towns for them to visit, or cities for them to conquer.  Can the player build an empire?  What happens when the king's army has fallen to you alone, and there is not a man left who would stand against you?  Can you go south and find... stuff?  As with Minecraft and Terraria, it doesn't really need an ending, because if it's done right, the right type of player will be content to create/explore until all the possibilities are exhausted.\n\n  I think this works especially well in a text adventure format for much the same reason Dwarf Fortress has its particular art style--because art is hard, and for every item/object you create in a normal game there not only has to be images for the item, but also animations and effects associated with its function.  We could churn out new stuff all day, and once the code was done, we could upload it.  No problem.  There wouldn't be a huge memory problem because we can have as much stuff as we want in a world and no matter what, it all fits within the data confines of relatively small .txt file.\n\nI still really like Asyranok's idea, like I said, I told you guys I'd let you know if I thought of anything.",
