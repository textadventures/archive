However, if you're a solid programmer and want to tackle it, you can always download the Quest source yourself and add in the feature. If it works well I'm sure Alex would merge it back into the main source repo for inclusion in future versions of Quest.\n\nIn the meantime, I like to use a little program called Trizbort to help me map out complicated places. It doesn't export into Quest format, but it helps give me a visual representation when I'm setting up the rooms in Quest.",
