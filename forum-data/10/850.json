If I find the Quest system to my liking, I may be here in the future.\n\nI am currently going through the help documentation, as well as learning through trial-by-error; the ins and outs of Quest QDK.\n\nMy current background in scripting has been with Never Winter Nights, though it has been about 18 months since I've used the NWN scripting (on a side note: I stoped beause for every hour of programing, there was 2 hours of gameplay, this did not suite my style as a GM since I was running a continiuosly running game that did not go back to previous sections).\n\nAdditionally for the past 5 years I have been gaming online via OpenRPG (with some webrpg in the begining), and am very familar with typing up descriptions for people, places, and things.  My style is heavily influenced by anime, and my game can be very adult in nature.\n\nMy greatest weakness is that I suffer from terrible spelling.\n\nMy goal with quest is to create a game that will have at least 2 hours of play time.",
