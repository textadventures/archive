This all works fine, so I added a wizard to prompt the Administrator for current date and time to base the persistent time off of. All this works fine, and I thought it was causing an error and not changing my Status Variables value untill I checked in my Numeric Variables Debug Window, to find that none of my variables even start off with their values as defined in the code. I've tried it with and without scope values, these values are never modified by the code. I realize I could bypass all this by giving some game object properties similar to these and just read from the game object rather than store in variables and read them.\n\nClick to increase size.\n\nHere's a screenshot of my code...\n[url=http&#58;//s88880570&#46;onlinehome&#46;us/img/valuesexample&#46;jpg:2v2a078x][img:2v2a078x]http&#58;//s88880570&#46;onlinehome&#46;us/img/tn_valuesexample&#46;jpg[/img:2v2a078x][/url:2v2a078x]\n\nHere's the Questnet Numeric Variable Debug immediately after opening...\n[url=http&#58;//s88880570&#46;onlinehome&#46;us/img/numvardebugexample&#46;jpg:2v2a078x][img:2v2a078x]http&#58;//s88880570&#46;onlinehome&#46;us/img/tn_numvardebugexample&#46;jpg[/img:2v2a078x][/url:2v2a078x]\n\nI'd rather not have to work around this using object properties, I can but, by all accounts this shouldn't happen I believe.",
