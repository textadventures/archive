Once you have got a good grasp of writing Quest ASL by hand, the syntax for writing libraries is readily \"picked up\" from the Quest documentation.\n\nThe harder bit is that with a library you are usually NOT writing to deal with solving a specific problem, rather you are trying to write something which is general purpose, reusable and (ideally) as flexible as possible.\n\nThis is why my libraries have such a lot of code in them and don't always take the obvious 'easy way' to do things. \n\nAl",
