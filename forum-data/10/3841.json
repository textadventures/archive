But I had a thought just now...\n\nIf I search online, it turns out the game has already been mirrored onto IFDB. Even though the game is now private on Quest, the link from IFDB exists and is still pointing to my now private game.\n\nIs there a way to delete it from IFDB? The only other thought I had is to null out that game entry with a dummy game and then make a new one. I think I'll do that for now. I'd just hate to have my entry rejected later as the game is already &quot;published&quot;.\n\n(With my luck, that one mistake will come back to haunt me later.)",
