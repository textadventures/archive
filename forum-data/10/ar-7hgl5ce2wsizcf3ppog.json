For sake of argument, let's imagine it will be something like:\r\n\r\nPlayer: \"Hi\"\r\nCharacter: \"Hi\"\r\nPlayer: \"How are you?\"\r\nCharacter:  \"I'm fine\"\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nInstead of the whole thing being printed as a block when the sequence is triggered, is there a way to put a few seconds delay between each printed output?\r\n\r\nCheers.",
