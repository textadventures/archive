I reside in New Zealand and I'm 21 studying Info Tech.\r\n\r\nI am looking to create a game that is very complex. To simplify it, I want to make a life sim rpg. I'm trying to figure out what text based software will best suit my needs. What I want to do is have an inventory, money stat, skill stats, etc. I want the player to be able to do things, interact with things, and most importantly have fun with the game. \r\n\r\nI also have another question and this one is probably a long shot but can Quest support multiplayer features?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if making a very complex life sim rpg and multiplayer features are possible? Multiplayer features isn't a big deal. \r\n\r\nCheers everyone!",
