So I cannot add the test for a 'weight' attribute in the way the tutorial describes.\r\nSo my script looks like:\r\n\r\nif (HasAttribute(this, \"weight\")) {\r\n  msg (\"The \" + object.name + \" weighs \" + object.weight + \" grams.\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"You cannot estimate the weight of that\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe script looks ok but the 'else' condition always happens regardless of whether the object has a weight attribute. This seems like a fundamental concept so I must be doing something wrong. \r\n\r\nAdvice gratefully received.",
