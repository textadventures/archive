At the end of the game, a different ending greets the player depending on what the \"score\" is at. But how do I do this?\n\nWhat I'm after is:\n\nIf \"score\" less than 20 then display text score1\nIf \"score\" less than 40 then display text score2\nIf \"score\" less than 60 then display text score3\n\nAnd so on... Only the problem is, I can't seem to figure out how to reference the \"score\" variable properly. I can change it with tasks but then when I try to add a condition that \"score\" must be less than 20, nothing happens.\n\nCan anyone help?",
