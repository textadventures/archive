Namely, how does one use object X with object Y in \"novella\" theme? I know how to make it work in regular theme when typing in commands like: \"use X on Y\" or \"use X with Y\". I even tested it and it works without a glitch. However, I want to skip the commands and use only mouse interface in my game. So how can I use two objects on each other with mouse interface? Any help would be appreciated.",

There's an option to have certain verbs be only displayed if the object is in your inventory but it doesn't appear to work.

Using object x on object y paste in this script which checks if you're carrying both objects first.\r\n\r\n<code>if (not Got(object x)) {\r\n  msg (\"You need to be carrying it first.\")\r\n}\r\nelse if (Got(object x)) {\r\n  if (not Got(object y)) {\r\n    msg (\"You aren't carrying object y\")\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"Something magical happens.\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n",
