You come accross this town that has it's entire water supply poisoned at it's source (the well spring at the bottom of the mine.) The poison has wiped out most of the elders and leaves the entire town sick and helpless (here is where the player hopefully ads a little, rather they are hoping for some kind of reward or are just on some kind of holy quest.) The \"evil\" I mentioned is Jakk Tornclaw, a well known orc with an evil magic aura tainting any water around him with Lacadasia. The only known cure for it can only be made with fresh pure water. After killing him there is an immidiate effect on the water. Going from a thick black sludge to pure crystal clear water. Now as far as stats go I think I'm going to make one male and one female character from which you can choose at the begining of the game. Seeing as how I'm new at this and will probably just have stats improve at each level. Not very much customization yet. At least not until I am more familiar with this kind of thing. There will on the other-hand be a healer that is sick and can only cure physical wounds until the water problem is fixed. A dwarven Weapon Shop owner that shows signs of the sickness but his dwarven pride won't allow him to close up shop, and an elven armor shop keeper that is seemingly immune (until later in the game when he collapses and can no longer help you) other than that I'm not really sure. I am open to names on the disease as well. I don't really want a real sickness and nothing really sounds good so any suggestions you guys might have feel free to tell me.",
