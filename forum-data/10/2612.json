      "EditableText": "Hello all!\nSo I'm just going to jump right into this. I'm having three main problems right now.\n\n-How do I make a text block or print message command happen only once per game? Suppose, to make this sound simpler than it is, I want to print the message &quot;The floorboard Squeaks as you walk in.&quot; upon entering a specific room, but only the first time you enter that room and never again for the rest of the game.\n\n-How do I make a command do multiple things depending on what room you're in? Say I drew 15 maps and each one has a &quot;you are here&quot; icon. If I want player to &quot;use map&quot; and it show the JPEG of the map with the corresponding &quot;you are here&quot; icon for that room, how do I make &quot;use map&quot; show a different picture depending on what room you're in?\n\n-Lastly, how do I make a command do multiple things depending on what puzzle is currently active? Let's say that there is a &quot;give hint&quot; command that, when typed, a text block appears with a hint according to the puzzle the player is currently on. I figured I could use flags (when 'puzzle' flag is on, make the &quot;give hint&quot; command say, &quot;Move to the next puzzle) but how do I do this for several different puzzles? Like, if a player needs a rope, the hint giving command will tell them to look for a rope, but after they get it, it tells them to look for a stick. After you get the stick it tells you to look for a knife. Ect. ect. Is there any possible way to make that consistent through the whole game and, if so, how do I do it?\n\nI know this is a lot of questions all at once, but if any help could be given it would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks,\n-Agerion\n\nEDIT:\n-Another new problem. When compiling the game to send it to a friend (so he can take a look at what I have so far) everything goes fine. On the one place I need to play an MP3 and show a JPEG after printing text, however, the game will print the text, show the JPEG, and freeze up trying to play that MP3. What am I doing wrong? I have a labyrinth of folders where all my music, sounds, and pictures are, do I need to clump them all in one folder?",
