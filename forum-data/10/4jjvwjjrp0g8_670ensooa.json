      "EditableText": "> So...Your telling me that I am wasting my time creating my own divs and positions?\r\n\r\nMaybe.\r\n\r\nA number of games on this site are unplayable for me. My new laptop's screen is much higher resolution than my old one, and my vision is no longer that good. So I have my browser's default font size set a little larger than default. This means that if you're positioning anything to a specific number of pixels, the text might not fit in the box. Or if you set text to a pixelk size rather than a proportional size, the text is too small for me to read.\r\n\r\nYou can position elements in CSS as a number of pixels, or in inches, or in em. But you need to be careful not to make assumptions about how many ems are an inch, or how many pixels to an em. This is why in my layout scripts, I put a lot of effort into making sure everything is arranged according to the available space, and not making assumptions about how much that is. My adjusted sidebar script makes sure that if the window is too small to fit the number of displkayed panes, there is a scroll bar, and similar things.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a div (or an iframe) take up the whole screen so it's easier to see the whole help text, that's easy enough. But you should make sure to set `scrollY: auto` rather than `scrollY: hidden`, so that users with a smaller screen can still see everything.\r\n\r\nHTML was originally designed to brovide a flexible user interface. Which is why in previous versions there was a standard for `<em>` (emphasis) and `<strong>` (strong emphasis). For most people, these were treated the same as non-standard `<i>` and `<b>`. Using `<em>` reminds you that someone reading on a braille terminal, or with their computer reading the text aloud, will have that text emphasised in some way even if it isn't necessarily italic.\r\n\r\nMaking neat layouts that work regardless of the screen resolution and other text settings is possible, you've got all the tools you  need. But it's very hard to get right, because you need to avoid making any assumptions about the user's layout. In the end, most times it's probably fine if you make something that will work for *most* users. But it's always nicer to get the impression that a game designer thought about how their work would adapt to a different screen size, or a different text size.\r\n\r\nSorry; mini-rant there. But there are so many different ways to play a game. I still remember when smartphones were a rare thing, and so many web designers made menus that you have to hover the mouse over to make them appear. We don't want to be those designers again. It's a little extra effort to make a layout that adapts to the device it's used on, and to the user's needs. Whether you make that effort is up to you :p",
