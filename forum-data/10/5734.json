      "EditableText": "Agreed.  I just ended up making everything invisible in my dark room.  When the lights were turned on, I then made them visible.  Also, when the lights were turned on, the room was given a flag.  In the room description box, I used an 'If' statement to print two different descriptions.  I know it doesn't really answer your initial question, but I too tried the 'light/dark' and 'objects are light sources' bit, and had no luck, so I resorted to a workable solution that really isn't any more work (just different).  If you want to see the code I have for a dark room, I'll provide it, but I assume you already know how to manipulate my work-around.",
