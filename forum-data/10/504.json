As a workaround I think you could try putting the random number into a string variable first, e.g.\n\n[code:354kalms]\nset string &lt;randnum; $rand&#40;1;9999&#41;$&gt;\nset string &lt;Register&#46;temp&#91;userid&#93;; $name&#40;%userid%&#41;$#randnum#&gt;\n[/code:354kalms]\n\nI think that ought to work - can't test it right now though.",
