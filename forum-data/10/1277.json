Here is a strange problem I have encountered for the first time today.\nI am editing in QDK and I am using a conditional for a room description and for some reason right after I click the OK button the command that I entered for a &quot;Print&quot; becomes a &quot;Other Script Command&quot; and no matter how many times I go back and change it, the minute I get out of it the change takes place.  What is going on?",

I think what happens is if a line isn't recognizable the editor reads container tags but skips the bad code, so anything afterwards become embraced by previous container tags even if you don't want them to.\n\nThis crossed my mind because as I'm getting better at coding, problems are disappearing, and I can't see how the Editor will &quot;choose&quot; to goof up at times and not goof up at others.
