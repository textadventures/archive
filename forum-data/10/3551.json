(im aware that you can create apps already but the textadventure will only be one of the features). I will obviously need to style the elements ti fit in with the rest of the prototype?",

You could always link directly to the online variant of your Quest game, but if you want to have your own look and feel *around* the game, then you'd have to somehow embed the Quest elements into your page. It seems like it could be possible in theory (the latter part), as long as CORS doesn't give you grief, but Alex would be more knowledgable about what's doable.",
