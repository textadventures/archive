To do this, I created a small Java application that extracts texts embedded in the game into several files. Once translated those files, the application allows you to mix them again getting the game translated.\n\n The interesting thing would be that Quest had already separated into two layers: one for the code; and a second one with the language-dependent messages. As this is not so, my application is an attempt to recreate that situation. Translating a Quest game is not only translate the messages because Quest system was not intended to be multilingual internally and it requires modifications to the code once the text are translated.\n\n I've done some tests with a complex game that get me Alex, but I have not received permission from the author to do the translation, so I turn to the community Quest to request source codes of Quest games to test my extract/merge program of messages.\n\n Also, I would be interested to focus on a specific game on which debugging the translation and get a full-finished translated game. I may need the cooperation of the author in the translation process on specific implementation details of the game. I would need the author permission to publish the source code together with the translated version (Spanish initially, but surely also Esperanto).\n\nMy username in Quest is Francisco and forta in the Quest forum.\n\nQuest is an excelent software... but it would be even better if it used the mencioned two layers design!\n\nThanks for you attention!\n\nFrancisco",
