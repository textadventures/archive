Now with that being said I am in no way a coder and mostly use GUI Editor (Which is quit powerful) but I think beginners maybe able to learn a little without asking 100's of questions on forums(No problem with that just know how frustrating it is) so you can get started with a little more then basics. I know their few videos that cover very very little but no indepth tutorials on quest or lets make an actual working game. So I started new channel dedicated to game creation tutorials for beginners like myself to learn more then just basics.\r\n\r\nChannel link https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGSCL0CED0oIG8J1mKyDoMw\r\n\r\nHope to see you there\r\nMike\r\n\r\nPS: Alex if this post is in wrong spot I apologize!",
