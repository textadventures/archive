And there I run an if-script \n\n[code:19w08dlf]if (RandomChance(50)) {\n  msg (&quot;I did, didn't I? I had the gun&#46; And there was a man&#46; Did I shoot?&quot;)\n  AddPageLink (yes gun, shoot yes, &quot;yes&quot;)\n  AddPageLink (yes gun, shoot no, &quot;no&quot;)\n}\nelse {\n  msg (&quot;No&#46; No, I didn't&#46; There was no gun&#46; There was a birthday&#46;&quot;)\n  AddPageLink (yes gun, your birthday, &quot;your birthday?&quot;)\n  AddPageLink (yes gun, whose birthday, &quot;whose birthday?&quot;)\n}[/code:19w08dlf]\n\nThe Problem is when you Play the game the Options are not showing. \nam I doing something wrong or do I just have to put the if script where the Player is moving and the text on different pages?",
