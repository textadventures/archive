I find this useful for various reasons and remember using this in Quest 2.0, but can't seem to find it in 5.\n\n2) I have a closed, locked container for which the player does not have the key. I have used a custom 'If the player tries to lock/unlock' message which I would also like to be displayed when the player tries to open the object, but instead the parser returns 'It is locked.' How can I customise this message, as the open verb seems to be unchangeable for container objects?\n\nThanks for reading!",

One more related question, if you don't mind...\n\nI have a door which when opened will take you to the next room if a certain condition has been fulfilled. To do this I have made the door openable/closeable and checked a flag in the open script. If the condition is not fulfilled it returns a 'first time' message, which then changes to an 'otherwise' message if the player tries again still not having fulfilled the condition.\n\nI would like the same script to be triggered if the player types 'answer door' (the room description states that the door is being knocked upon), but simply copying the script to a custom command is unsuitable because the 'first time' message would display twice if the player tried 'answer door' and then 'open door'. So I need 'answer door' to trigger the actual 'open door' script. How can this be achieved?\n\nI hope this makes sense, it's what I was trying to ask in my first question but I couldn't think of a succinct example. Alex may have answered this question above, but I wasn't sure where/how his code should be implemented and therefore couldn't try it out. Thanks again!",
