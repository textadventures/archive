So, you can use the much more numerous TextAdventure resources to learn how to do the stuff you want, except that functionality is just accessed differently in a GameBook compared to how its accessed in TextAdventure.\n\nAs Jay stated, the way (or only way) to access that scripting Functionality, through the GUI~Editor, is:\n\nfor individual Pages, via selecting the:\n\n[SCRIPT] or [SCRIPT+TEXT], options for the 'Page Type' drop down box for your specific pages where you want/need sripting to be done.\n\nThese options allow you to use your Pages for doing (or adding) that scripting functionality into/for/with that Page.\n\n'whatever' Page Object -&gt; 'Page' Tab -&gt; Page Type -&gt; [SCRIPT] or [SCRIPT+Text] -&gt; (see below)\n\nadd new script -&gt; (choose your scripts and set them up)\n\nand, there's also the:\n\n'game' Game Object -&gt; 'Script' Tab -&gt; add new script -&gt; (choose your scripts and set them up)\n\nwhich, unlike in the TextAdventure, I believe, is to just run those added/created scripts first everytime you switch Pages.\n\n(In the TextAdventure, the scripts added in this similar area in it: 'start' Script of the 'Scripts' Tab of the 'game' Game Object, will be the first things done/run at the start of playing the game, which for example, is often used for 'character creation' if making a RPG type of game)\n\nTo have scripts run as the first thing upon starting a GameBook game, you'll simply set up your starting Page with your desired scripts, via again just by choosing the [SCRIPT] or [SCRIPT+TEXT], and adding the desired scripts and setting them up)\n\n----------\n\nall of the above, is basically how the scripting is done in GameBook, so now it's just a matter of learning scripting (mainly the 'if' Script) and Attributes, unless you already know a bit about them and/or coding.\n\nif you don't know how to do/use Scripting and Attributes, there's a lot of resources on them for the TextAdventure, and there's mostly no difference. The Attribute usage and scripting is mostly the exact same between GameBook and TextAdventures, with only the main difference in that the GameBook only has the 'game' Game Object, the 'player' Player Object, and the 'whatever' Page Objects, to apply/add those Attributes to for using in/for/with the Scripting, whereas the TextAdventure has many more types of Objects that can be used.\n\nthese are two super scripts that let you do 90% of everything that you want to do in your game:\n\n1. Attribute Creation-Setting/Manipulating-Changing-Resetting/Usage:\n\n'whatever' Page Object -&gt; Page Type -&gt; [Script] or [Script+Text] -&gt; (see below)\n\nadd new script -&gt; (section/category: variables) -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; (I don't know the GUI~Editor's options as I just code my games directly - I don't use the GUI~Editor much, so I chose the [EXPRESSION] option as this lets me code in what I want it to do, so I'll show below this way of doing it - otherwise you can just figure out what option to choose instead of [EXPRESSION] and set it up) -&gt; [Expression] -&gt; (see below)\n\nset variable __________ = [Expression] ___________\n\nAttribute Scripting Syntax has this general form (in code):\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n\nAttribute Scripting Syntax has this general form (in GUI~Editor):\n\nset variable Object_name.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n\nsome examples (in code):\n\n// Object Names: player\n// Attribute Names: strength, weapon_damage, damage\n\nplayer.strength = 100\nplayer.weapon_damage = 10\nplayer.damage = player.weapon_damage + player.weapon_damage * player.strength / 100\n// player.damage = 10 + 10 * 100 / 100 = 20\n\nsome examples (using the GUI~Editor's form):\n\n// Object Names: player\n// Attribute Names: strength, weapon_damage, damage\n\nset variable player.strength = [Expression] 100\nset variable player.weapon_damage = [Expresison] 10\nset variable player.damage = [Expression] player.weapon_damage + player.weapon_damage * player.strength / 100\n// player.damage = 10 + 10 * 100 / 100 = 20\n\n2. and then here's the 'if' Script&#058;\n\n'whatever' Page Object -&gt; Page Type -&gt; [Script] or [Script+Text] -&gt; (see below)\n\nadd new script -&gt; (section/cateogery: scripts) -&gt; 'if' Script -&gt;  (I don't know the GUI~Editor's options as I just code my games directly - I don't use the GUI~Editor much, so I chose the [EXPRESSION] option as this lets me code in what I want it to do, so I'll show below this way of doing it - otherwise you can just figure out what option to choose instead of [EXPRESSION] and set it up) -&gt; [Expression] -&gt; (see below)\n\nif [EXPRESSION] Object_name.Attribute_name OPERATOR Value_or_Expression\n\nan example:\n\nif [EXPRESSION] player.test_score &gt;= 90\n-&gt; then, add new script -&gt; (section/category: variables) -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.test_grade = [EXPRESSION] &quot;A&quot;\nadd else if -&gt; [EXPRESSION]-&gt; if [EXPRESSION] player.test_score &gt;= 80\n&gt; then, add new script -&gt; (section/category: variables) -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.test_grade = [EXPRESSION] &quot;B&quot;\nadd else if -&gt; [EXPRESSION]-&gt; if [EXPRESSION] player.test_score &gt;= 70\n&gt; then, add new script -&gt; (section/category: variables) -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.test_grade = [EXPRESSION] &quot;C&quot;\nadd else if -&gt; [EXPRESSION]-&gt; if [EXPRESSION] player.test_score &gt;= 60\n&gt; then, add new script -&gt; (section/category: variables) -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.test_grade = [EXPRESSION] &quot;D&quot;\nadd else -&gt; add new script -&gt; (section/category: variables) -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.test_grade = [EXPRESSION] &quot;F&quot;\n\n---------------\n\nhere's some resources for Scripting and Attribute learning:\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/</a><!-- m -->\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/character_creation.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... ation.html</a><!-- m --> (this is a good guide on how to get and do stuff, from input from the person playing the game.

My last problem was not naming the &quot;Back&quot; link in quotes, and I still had redundant code on the Inventory page itself that I forgot to remove.  Now it's all handled from that add to dictionary thing you made for me on the 'game' page.  Amazing.  I'm humbled!  Now my players can look at how many pieces of wyvern jerky they have in their rucksacks anytime they want in a game book (as opposed to a text adventure, which a another user rightfully mentioned I should probably just have been using in the first place).  But it's nice to have this added layer of functionality to the lesser-used game book mode.  <br/><br/>You wrote some really helpful stuff in your last couple of posts just about concepts in general, like what does what and why.
