      "EditableText": "Hello,\r\nin Gamebook, if I deselect the Display-Option \"Clear screen between each page\", the old pagetexts will stay on screen. That's what I want. But while the old pagetexts are scrolling up when the story proceeds, the blue links within that old pagetexts stay blue and selectable. That makes no sense in my story, the old links should be changed into normal text after a selection has been done. RemovePageLink() did not work for me in this case. However, I found out, that by adding the line ```<options type='stringdictionary' />``` to every pagesection in the sourcecode, it's working suddenly: all the old links will turn into normal text, after clicking on a link.\r\n\r\nIs there a more elegant way to do this? Maybe in the global script of the \"game\" page?",
