I was thinking maybe the ability to do subsets of existing lists ... i.e. we can show all objects ... but it would be useful if we could only show characters (especially for games with lots of objects) ... so maybe somehow customize it? maybe by properities ... ? Or by type maybe? I realize if we had multiple options it could get insane, but even having the ability to limit it by a single property or type would be enormously useful. \n\nI also thought it would be nice if we could have a 'select' type for the property drop down that would let us specify options ... (for instance, I'm adding in a SIZE property to the interface in my library ... and the script works based on the idea that one of these values is in that property  - XS, S, M, L, XL, G ... it would be nice to have that as part of a drop down list rather than relying on people who use my library to input the correct values.) \n\nJust some thoughts.",
