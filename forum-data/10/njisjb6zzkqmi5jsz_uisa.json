When they climb down, It will be locked, so they will get the key. So, obviously, this is a major problem, if I can't do this. Okay. So you're probably like, \"Get onto the question already,\" so I will.\r\n\r\nI added the script  (UI version) for showing the exit, when you go up the tree for the first time. But when it shows up (still on the UI) it looks something like this: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/O8XQFHq.png\">See an image here</a>. As you can see from the image, the second drop-down doesn't have any values in it! (I tried opening it, closing it, reloading the page etc.) Can you help me? Or am I just doing the whole thing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nXelxa\r\n",
