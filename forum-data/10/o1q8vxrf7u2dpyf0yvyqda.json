So the script in User Interface Initialisation will be:\r\n```\r\nJS.eval(\"$(function(){function e(){var d=Date.now();ASLEvent('UpdateRealTime',d.getHours()+';'+d.getMinutes())}e(),setInterval(e,6e4)});\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre you having trouble creating a function in Quest?\r\nGo to the 'functions' section and press 'new'. Enter the name `UpdateRealTime`. If you want to change this to something language specific, you need to change it in the script above as well.\r\nFor the function parameters, you need to add one and call  it `time`. Then for the function's script, add the code:\r\n```\r\ntime = Split (time)\r\ngame.hour = ToInt (StringListItem (time, 0))\r\ngame.minute = ToInt (StringListItem (time, 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give you two attributes, `game.hour` and `game.minute`, which contain the current time (to within one minute). If the computer goes to sleep or is in standby, or if the player resets their clock while the game is running, the game will have the old time for up to a minute before it is corrected.",
