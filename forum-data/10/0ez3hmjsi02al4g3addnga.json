When I type in \"look at bed\" it should say, \"There's no time to rest,\" but instead it does nothing and the text is still in the box where you type. Am I missing something obvious? Yes, I have set the message, but it won't do anything when I click on the hyperlink OR when I type the command. Anyone know how I can fix this?",
