Here's how to do exactly the same thing in the editor:\n\n-We're messing with a room description here, so go to the &quot;Room&quot; tab for that room.  Change the big &quot;Description&quot; field to &quot;Run a Script&quot;.\n\n-Click &quot;Add New Script&quot;, and select an &quot;If&quot; statement.  After the word &quot;if&quot; you have a drop down of options.  Select &quot;object is visible&quot;.  The next dropdown defaults to &quot;object&quot;, meaning it wants the name of an object in dropdown #3.  Select the name of your object from the third dropdown (in my example, it was called &quot;thing&quot;).\n\n-This creates two conditions, one for the object being visible and one for it being absent.  The problem is, if we're carrying it, it's technically visible despite not being a part of the room proper, so we need to account for that.  Under &quot;then&quot; for our &quot;if&quot; statement above, click &quot;add new script&quot; and select &quot;if&quot; again, to create a second &quot;if&quot; statement inside the first.  This one will differentiate between visible in the room and visible in inventory.\n\n-For our new &quot;if&quot; statement, select &quot;player is carrying object&quot; from the dropdown.  Again, leave the second dropdown on &quot;object&quot; and select the object name (&quot;thing&quot;) in the third.  Under that &quot;if&quot; statement's &quot;then&quot;, add two new scripts.  The first is &quot;Print a message&quot;, where you'll input the message you want (in this instance, the one where the thing is absent).  The second is &quot;Show a Picture&quot;.  Click the browse button, find your picture, and it will pop up in the right place.\n\n-Under &quot;else&quot;, do the same thing, with the other message and picture.\n\n-Under the &quot;else&quot; for the first &quot;if&quot; statement, do the same thing again, with the absent version of the message and picture.\n\nThat's it.  Now, when you switch to code view, it shows you the behind-the-scenes functions that do all that stuff (ListContains, ScopeVisible, etc.).  The best way to learn the basic code function, I think, is to do something in the editor, then switch to code view and see what it says.  That should help you decipher some of the code stuff.\n\n[quote=&quot;Davidmarks&quot;:w7o6fkw8]Also when I want to delete items I don't know how.[/quote:w7o6fkw8]\n\nIf you are referring to rooms or objects in the game, just click on them in the editor tree (on the left) and push the delete key.  It's that simple, but be aware that deleting a parent deletes all its children, too (so deleting a room will delete all the objects in the room too, unless you move them somewhere else first).\n\nIf there's something else you're trying to delete, let me know and I'll help if I can.\n\nP.S.- It's no bother, BTW.  I'm still learning, and have come on here plenty to ask for help.  People here are really helpful about that kind of thing.",
