That helped me identify the problem.\r\n\r\nI had to resort to deleting them one-by-one through trial and error because I was having difficulty determining what was different about the 'displayverb' occurrences, starting with my most recent objects. I isolated it to an ingame object (the deletion of which let me open the editor just fine) but I wanted to understand what the problem was so I started deleting individual codes of lines. Oddly, the 'displayverbs' code on this object looked fine, but by removing the 'displayverbs' code, I changed my error message:\r\n```\r\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object\r\n```\r\nI looked at other lines which might be causing this issue in this particular object. After a little more trial and error, here was the problematic code:\r\n```\r\n<game type=\"int\">0</game>\r\n```\r\nThe object in question is a video game console, so I set an attribute called \"game\" to an integer output that would go up every time the player Used it. In practice, each integer value would correspond to a new scene to play out. What I didn't realize was that I changed the nature of the gaming console with this attribute. In fact, I didn't even end up using this mechanic, so I forgot about it after finishing my round of edits last night. This was all done entirely through the editor. Oops!",
