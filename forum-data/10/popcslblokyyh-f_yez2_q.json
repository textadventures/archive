I'm completely clueless as to how any of this works, so I've been following the Quest tutorial, creating the simple game as instructed. I understand how to do a lot of things, like creating rooms, creating exits, creating objects and characters, making objects into containers, taking and dropping objects, ETC. No problem there.\r\n\r\nBut there are two things I've had problems with, and I've literally spent several hours on each, trying to get them to work. The first issue is adding commands. As of right now, I can \"say\" something, and the game will respond with, \"You say ----, but no one replies.\" I struggled with that one for a long time, and I'm still not sure what was wrong. I think the code for this command given in the tutorial must have been incorrect, but I know next to nothing about coding, so... *Shrug*\r\n\r\nAnyway, what about making it possible for the player to say something, and have another character answer? Also, how do I set up other kinds of commands? What if I want to be able to \"run,\" \"climb,\" \"touch/feel,\" \"listen,\" ETC? These are just examples, because I'm really not sure at the moment what kinds of things I'd want to be able to do in a game, or even how much is possible to do in this kind of game.\r\n\r\nSecond, I'm totally lost when it comes to running scripts. I managed to be able to get my TV object to turn on and off and display different messages for each of those conditions, but I can't seem to figure out how to make anything else work. I'm supposed to use a defibrillator to revive a dead character, but no matter what I try I can't bring the character back to life. I'm also supposed to have a kitchen window that can be opened and closed, and when it is opened for the first time (only) a bee flies into the room. I can get the window open, and the bee into the room, but if I try to close the window the game says I can't do that because it's already closed. I think the trouble I'm having with both the character and the window might have something to do with setting object flags, but I'm really very confused.\r\n\r\nI hope I've explained things well enough. If someone could walk me through the process of running scripts, step by step, using the web version, I would be ever so grateful. My only request is that you not use pictures. I can't follow pictures, only very specific written instructions. Thanks.",

See below for the link (I know you don't need it - just being complete):\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/\r\n\r\nAfter that, there's XanMag's 'templates and tutorial' (tutorial 2) game, which he made due to the (unfortunate) lack of transition from following the tutorial's specfic instructions/guidance to trying to do stuff on your own in your own game. As it's a big jump from doing the tutorial to trying to do stuff on your own. You really have to understand the concepts, which the tutorial doesn't quite help enough with. XanMag's 'templates and tutorial' (tutorial 2) game, tries to help with this, by giving lessons/instructions on many various things that you would want to do in your game. see below for the link:\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/games/topic/5940/quest-tutorials-and-templates-published\r\n\r\nafter that, here's some guides for you:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/character_creation.html (this is a good guide to study, showing how 'get input' and 'show menu' work along with some Attribute usage)\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest (the various posts/threads in this main forum)\r\n\r\nand there's the quest doc site itself (once you start understanding quest, and especially coding/scripting, better. As you can look up most of quest's features/stuff/content/scriptings/objects/elements/commands/verbs/etc):\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nlearning to make a game and the coding/scripting and its logic involved/needed, is not easy. It's a slow process, but quest is great for this, if you're interested. I myself found quest with no knowledge of coding, about 4 years ago, and now thanks to quest, I'm taking programming classes in school (slowly towards) a CS (computer science) major, and have been shocked at how well quest has prepared me for them!\r\n\r\nthe biggest (first) jump for a person new to quest and/or especially to coding, after learning the basics of using quest, is learning quest's Attribute and 'If' Script usage, as once you learn these two SUPER scripts, you can do 90% of everything that you want to do in/for your game (making).\r\n\r\nYou have to train your brain (as this is quite unnnatural) to get into this new mindset/mentality of game-making/code logic:\r\n\r\nit's similiar to \"should I do this or should I do that\", except replace \"should I\" with \"if I do this or if I do that\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (animal.type = \"lion\") {\r\n  msg (\"You run for your life, hoping you're faster than the other person, and that the other person fills up the lions belly\")\r\n} else if (animal.type = \"deer\") {\r\n  msg (\"Ah, look at the cute deer! You watch the harmless deer, enjoying the cute animal, in total safety\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (orc.dead = true) { // GUI~Editor: 'if' Script\r\n  msg (\"The orc is already dead, silly.\") // GUI~Editor: 'print a message' Script\r\n} else if (orc.dead = false) { // optional part of the 'if' Script\r\n  orc.dead = true // we need to tell (via set/re-set'ting the 'orc' Object's 'dead' Boolean Attribute) quest that the orc is now dead, which is what this code line does. GUI~Editor: 'set a variable or attribute' Script\r\n  msg (\"You fight and kill the orc.\") // we (need to) tell/'prompt' the human/user playing the game, that the orc is dead, which is what this code line does. GUI~Editor: 'print a message' Script\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```\r\nwindow.is_opened = true -----> effectively/conceptually/logically: the window is open\r\nwindow.is_opened = false ----> effectively/conceptually/logically: the window is closed\r\n\r\norc.dead = true ---> effectively/conceptually/logically: the orc is dead\r\norc.dead = false ---> effectively/conceptually/logically: the orc is alive\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, the opposite logic (use whichever you like better or whichever works better):\r\n\r\n```\r\nwindow.is_closed = true ----> effectively/conceptually/logically: the window is closed\r\nwindow.is_closed = false ----> effectively/conceptually/logically: the window is open\r\n\r\norc.alive = true ---> effectively/conceptually/logically: the orc is alive\r\norc.alive = false ---> effectively/conceptually/logically: the orc is dead\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe'll be using the 'is_opened' logic for the example below:\r\n\r\n(except: we'll use the built-in Boolean Attribute: isopen, for the example below, not my custom named 'is_opened/is_closed' Boolean Attributes as seen above)\r\n\r\n(Object Name: window)\r\n(Boolean) Attribute Name: isopen // this is a built-in Boolean Attribute, which is part of the handling of opening/closing\r\nBoolean Attribute Value: ('true' or 'false'), let's initially have the window being closed, so the value is initially set as: false\r\n\r\n'close' Verb for the 'window' Object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (window.isopen = true) { // quest shortens when it's '=true' to this: if (window.isopen) {\r\n  window.isopen = false\r\n  msg (\"You close the open window\")\r\n} else if (window.isopen = false) {\r\n  msg (\"The window is already closed, silly.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n'open' Verb for the 'window' Object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (window.isopen = true) { // again, quest shortens when it's '=true' to this: if (window.isopen) {\r\n  msg (\"The window is already open, silly.\")\r\n} else if (window.isopen = false) {\r\n  window.isopen = true\r\n  msg (\"You open the closed window.\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have to have this kind of mindset of 'if (conditionals)' way of thinking about everything.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nanyways the above was a brief example (in code) of the logic you need to train your brain in.\r\n\r\nto do this stuff in the GUI~Editor, you use these two scripts:\r\n\r\n1. Attribute usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun as script -> add new scipt -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nchoose the correct script: [whatever], or if you don't know the GUI~Editor script choices/options like me, then you can use the: [EXPRESSION] option/choice, and type/write in the expression (code line) directly.\r\n\r\nsome examples, using the [EXPRESSION] option/choice:\r\n\r\nset variable player.alias = [EXPRESSION] \"HK\"\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. 'If' Script usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun as script -> add new scipt -> 'scripts' section/category -> 'if' Script -> (see below, again using the '[EXPRESSION]' option/choice, as I don't know the GUI~Editor's script choices/options very well)\r\n\r\nif [EXPRESSION] player.alias = \"HK\"\r\n\r\n, then:\r\n\r\n-> add new scipt -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below, again using the '[EXPRESSION]' option/choice, as I don't know the GUI~Editor's script choices/options very well):\r\n\r\nprint a [EXPRESSION] \"Ah, so you're the awesome HK!\"\r\n\r\nelse:\r\n\r\n-> add new scipt -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below, again using the '[EXPRESSION]' option/choice, as I don't know the GUI~Editor's script choices/options very well):\r\n\r\nprint a [EXPRESSION] \"Oh, hi, \" + player.alias + \", nice to meet you.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nanyways, again... lol\r\n\r\nI know the code examples probably confuse you, I was just using them to show the logic/mentality understanding of it.\r\nUse the GUI~Editor example in the part directly above this part to hopefully help you understand it better.\r\n\r\nI also got a guide on trying to explain this stuff in more detail here:\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nthis was just a quick brief (and likely confusing / poorly done) post, so please ask if you need any help or got any questions or are confused by anything, as then I can try to do a better job as I'm specifically trying to answer/respond to you or your question, lol.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nI too had some difficulty with the tutorial and specifically the defibulator part (though this fixed up a bit in the tutorial afterwards --- when I did the tutorial defibulator part 4 years ago, it was even more confusing than it is now, lol), if you want to see my own beginning for laughs (I wanted to learn to code, so that's why I quickly jumped into it):\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/3348/noobie-hks-help-me-thread\r\n\r\nI was so confused by all of the terms and overwhelmed after doing the tutorial... it took me awhile to get it all understood and straightened out, lol.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nAlso...\r\n\r\nCommands vs Verbs:\r\n\r\nVerbs act upon that specific Object to add/create them for, using the buttons and hyperlinks you can click on, during game play.\r\n\r\nCommands are generalized, meaning you have to input-specify what Object(s) you're acting upon, via a typed-in input during game play using the command/text box at the bottom of the screen, and thus you got to set up your Commands to handle the inputs by the person playing the game.\r\n\r\nfor examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthe 'orc' Object's 'fight' (custom-mine-HK's) Verb example (in code):\r\n\r\n(Verbs are the just an Object's Script Attributes with a just bit extra coding to make them be Verbs)\r\n\r\n<object name=\"orc\">\r\n  <attr name=\"fight\" type=\"script\">\r\n    msg (\"You fight the orc\")\r\n  </attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"displayverbs\" type=\"simplestringlist\">fight</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<verb>\r\n  <property>fight</property>\r\n  <pattern>fight</pattern>\r\n</verb>\r\n\r\n// you'd click on the 'fight' button or 'fight' hyperlink under/for/with the 'orc' Object during game play, and the results/output would be:\r\n// You fight the orc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n```\r\na 'fight' Command:\r\n\r\n<command name=\"fight_command\">\r\n  <pattern>fight #object#</pattern>\r\n  <script>\r\n    msg (\"You fight the \" + object.name + \".\")\r\n  </script>\r\n</command>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"orc\">\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"dragon\">\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n// if I type 'fight orc' during game play, the result/output is:\r\n// You fight the orc.\r\n//\r\n// if I type 'fight dragon' during game play, the result/output is:\r\n// You fight the dragon.\r\n\r\n// this was a very simple example, which didn't really show much in terms of handling the whatever the inputted Object was, but meh.\r\n\r\n// Commands are a bit more confusing as they require scripting/more scripting/handling, than do Verbs. We can get more into Commands, when/if you're ready for them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nanother example Command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<command name=\"character_information_screen_command\">\r\n  <pattern>info #object#</pattern>\r\n  <script>\r\n    ClearScreen\r\n    msg (\"Name: \" + object.alias)\r\n    msg (\"Strength: \" + object.strength)\r\n    msg (\"Endurance: \" + object.endurance)\r\n    msg (\"Dexterity: \" + object.dexterity)\r\n    msg (\"Agility: \" + object.agility)\r\n    msg (\"Intelligence: \" + object.intelligence)    \r\n    wait {\r\n      ClearScreen\r\n    }\r\n  </script> \r\n</command>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"player\">\r\n  <attr name=\"alias\" type=\"string\">HK</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"strength\" type=\"int\">100</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"endurance\" type=\"int\">90</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"dexterity\" type=\"int\">80</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"agility\" type=\"int\">70</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"intelligence\" type=\"int\">10</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"player2\">\r\n  <attr name=\"alias\" type=\"string\">John Doe</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"strength\" type=\"int\">10</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"endurance\" type=\"int\">20</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"dexterity\" type=\"int\">30</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"agility\" type=\"int\">40</attr>\r\n  <attr name=\"intelligence\" type=\"int\">100</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n// if I were to type 'info player', the result/output would be:\r\n//\r\n// (the screen is cleared)\r\n// Name: HK\r\n// Strength: 100\r\n// Endurance: 90\r\n// Dexterity: 80\r\n// Agility: 70\r\n// Intelligence: 10\r\n// 'continue' blue hyperlink (press to continue game)\r\n// (the screen is thus cleared again and the game continues)\r\n\r\n// if I were to type 'info player2', the result/output would be:\r\n//\r\n// (the screen is cleared)\r\n// Name: John Doe\r\n// Strength: 10\r\n// Endurance: 20\r\n// Dexterity: 30\r\n// Agility: 40\r\n// Intelligence: 100\r\n// 'continue' blue hyperlink (press to continue game)\r\n// (the screen is thus cleared again and the game continues)\r\n```",

I am a total beginner, so I will probably have a lot of them, but I don't want to be annoying.\r\n\r\nHopefully we can sync our schedules soon, but I have a family barbecue going on tomorrow, so I'm not sure how much time I'll have to be on the computer. If it's okay, I'll just post a few of my questions here, and if you have the time to answer them, great. If not, maybe we can talk about them in the chat room sometime this week. There's no rush; I'm just getting frustrated because there is so much to learn and I feel so clueless, lol.\r\n\r\nMy first question pertains to the \"More things to do with objects\" section of the tutorial:\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/more_things_to_do_with_objects.html\r\n\r\nEverything is fine with updating the descriptions for the Bob character. I have no problems running a script for the character's \"look at\" description, adding the \"if\" command, choosing the \"object has flag\" expression, entering the flag name, and adding the appropriate messages. I've also successfully created the defibrillator object and made sure that it can be taken.\r\n\r\nBut when I get to the next part, I get lost. The tutorial says:\r\n\"Now add a “Set object flag” command. Choose Bob from the objects list, and enter the flag name “alive”.\"\r\n\r\nI know I saw something that said \"set object flag\" when I was messing around with things a few days ago, but now I can't find it. Or, am I losing my mind and imagining things that just aren't there? Lol. I haven't bothered with the \"Using Functions\" or \"Ask and Tell\" parts of this section because they have to do with Bob, and I figured I had better wait to tackle those until I've dealt with the object flag issue.\r\n\r\nMy second question is about the \"Moving objects during the game\" section:\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/moving_objects_during_the_game.html\r\n\r\n I am able to create the \"bee\" object so that it doesn't appear in any of the rooms, and I can get it inside the kitchen after I've created the \"window\" object and opened it. And yet, the first time I set it up, I would try to close the window and the game would say that it was already closed. So I played with it a bit, and the second time I tried it, it told me the window was already open when I went to open it. Obviously, I'm missing a step somewhere.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are other things I'll want to ask, but I don't want to ask too many questions all at once. Thank you in advance for any wisdom you may have to share.\r\n\r\nOh, and I am using the web version. I know that means that I'm more limited in what I can do with a game, but the Windows desktop version isn't an option for me right now.",

      "EditableText": "Part ONE:\r\nHopefully, I don't make assumptions when addressing this.\r\n>\"I know I saw something that said \"set object flag\" when I was messing around with things a few days ago, but now I can't find it. Or, am I losing my mind and imagining things that just aren't there?\"\r\n\r\nYou are correct.  Wherever you have your use defib script, you will add the following (a related suggestion - when using objects on other objects, I find it more helpful to ALWAYS put the scripts I want run WITH the object I am using NOT with the object I am using it on - imagine a knife... how many things might a player try to use a knife on in a game?!?  If you place scripts on 'use other object on this' for each object you might use a knife on... well, it becomes a mess trying to find those scripts again when needed):\r\n1.  Add script.\r\n2.  The big pop-up window will appear that has all of the possible scripts you can add.  Scroll down until you see the Variables section.  The first choice under this section is 'Set Object Flag'.  Choose that.  \r\n3.  From here I think you know what to do.  Chose Object Bob and type the name of the flag in as 'alive'.\r\n4.  In the look at description for Bob, you need to switch it to an 'If' script and select 'If object has flag 'alive' then print whatever message you want.\r\nIn a bit, the tutorial tells you that you need to switch the use defib script to check to see IF Bob has the 'alive' flag.  That way you cannot use it on him again when he is alive!  If you have problems with that part let me know.\r\n\r\nNow, you can skip this next diatribe if you wish but here are my two cents on what you SHOULD do instead.  When it comes to making your own game, think of all of those things that you could do with Bob now that he is alive!  You could speak to him, ask him about things, give him things, tell him about stuff, look at him, OR have him respond to ANYTHING the player does!  If you complete this section as the tutorial suggests, you will need to check to see if Bob has the alive flag for every action you want Bob to respond to.  Instead of that, here is my little cheat, which may be easier for you anyway.\r\n1.  Create a dead room.  That is, create a room with no entrances or exits.  I call my dead room \"Item Warehouse\".  The player will NEVER know this room even exists!\r\n2.  Create an object in this room.  Name it alivebob.  In the alias under the name, type in Bob.\r\n3.  In the 'use defib on bob' script, simply add a move object script and move object Bob to [desired room] and move bob (the previously dead Bob) to the Item Warehouse.\r\nNow when you try to interact with alivebob (aka Bob), you don't have to check for any flags at all.  The player will not notice that there are actually two different Bobs at all.  It will only appear as one and it might save you the hassle of trying to check flags!  A note however - I only do this for objects that are incredibly dynamic, like NPCs.  Quick example, if you have a sword in your game that is protected by a steel cage and a button that lifts that cage, I would use a flag.  Push button, add flag to cage named lifted, run proper scripts to look at cage and getting the sword.  I hope part one makes sense.  Ask if you have questions.\r\n\r\nPart TWO:\r\nThis sort of is related to my alternative suggestion above.  \r\n>And yet, the first time I set it up, I would try to close the window and the game would say that it was already closed. So I played with it a bit, and the second time I tried it, it told me the window was already open when I went to open it. Obviously, I'm missing a step somewhere.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you almost have the whole bee thing settled, so I'll just mention this.  I just created a scenario in my 'Quest - Templates and Tutorial Game' and I ran into the same problem.  I looked back at my code and realized I had forgotten to add an 'open object window' script in the 'Script to run when opening object:' section under the container tab for the window.  Double check to make sure you have the 'open object window' script in the 'when opening' section and a 'close object window' script in the 'when closing' section.  If you do, two things I would suggest... make sure you didn't add a flag named 'open' or 'closed' to the window (I've done that once) and/or delete all things related to the 'window' object and start again.  I've come to understand that sometimes things work out when I start fresh.  Another side note, there are some other things that I did that are pretty easy to deal with the bee situation.  If you are curious, let me know and I'll let you know what I did to \"liven up\" that situation.\r\n\r\nHopefully the above will clear up a little bit of that tutorial.  It is rather difficult to understand the goal of the tutorial sometimes when the code lingo is not understood.  I was overwhelmed once, too.  Even after a couple year using Quest, I still need to ask for advice on the forums from time to time.  It's an ever-learning process, but is very enjoyable when you can start to understand the essential basics for game creation.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, the desktop/download version is WAY less buggy and WAY more stable than the online version.  I have never used the online version, so my advice is strictly for the desktop version.  This may cause some stumbling along the way.  Download the desktop version ASAP!  =)\r\n\r\nGood luck!",

Chose Object Bob and type the name of the flag in as 'alive'.</li>\n<li>In the look at description for Bob, you need to switch it to an 'If' script and select 'If object has flag 'alive' then print whatever message you want.<br>\nIn a bit, the tutorial tells you that you need to switch the use defib script to check to see IF Bob has the 'alive' flag.  That way you cannot use it on him again when he is alive!  If you have problems with that part let me know.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, you can skip this next diatribe if you wish but here are my two cents on what you SHOULD do instead.  When it comes to making your own game, think of all of those things that you could do with Bob now that he is alive!  You could speak to him, ask him about things, give him things, tell him about stuff, look at him, OR have him respond to ANYTHING the player does!  If you complete this section as the tutorial suggests, you will need to check to see if Bob has the alive flag for every action you want Bob to respond to.  Instead of that, here is my little cheat, which may be easier for you anyway.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a dead room.  That is, create a room with no entrances or exits.  I call my dead room \"Item Warehouse\".  The player will NEVER know this room even exists!</li>\n<li>Create an object in this room.  Name it alivebob.  In the alias under the name, type in Bob.</li>\n<li>In the 'use defib on bob' script, simply add a move object script and move object Bob to [desired room] and move bob (the previously dead Bob) to the Item Warehouse.<br>\nNow when you try to interact with alivebob (aka Bob), you don't have to check for any flags at all.  The player will not notice that there are actually two different Bobs at all.  It will only appear as one and it might save you the hassle of trying to check flags!  A note however - I only do this for objects that are incredibly dynamic, like NPCs.  Quick example, if you have a sword in your game that is protected by a steel cage and a button that lifts that cage, I would use a flag.  Push button, add flag to cage named lifted, run proper scripts to look at cage and getting the sword.  I hope part one makes sense.  Ask if you have questions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part TWO:<br>\nThis sort of is related to my alternative suggestion above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And yet, the first time I set it up, I would try to close the window and the game would say that it was already closed. So I played with it a bit, and the second time I tried it, it told me the window was already open when I went to open it. Obviously, I'm missing a step somewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like you almost have the whole bee thing settled, so I'll just mention this.  I just created a scenario in my 'Quest - Templates and Tutorial Game' and I ran into the same problem.  I looked back at my code and realized I had forgotten to add an 'open object window' script in the 'Script to run when opening object:' section under the container tab for the window.  Double check to make sure you have the 'open object window' script in the 'when opening' section and a 'close object window' script in the 'when closing' section.  If you do, two things I would suggest... make sure you didn't add a flag named 'open' or 'closed' to the window (I've done that once) and/or delete all things related to the 'window' object and start again.  I've come to understand that sometimes things work out when I start fresh.  Another side note, there are some other things that I did that are pretty easy to deal with the bee situation.  If you are curious, let me know and I'll let you know what I did to \"liven up\" that situation.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the above will clear up a little bit of that tutorial.  It is rather difficult to understand the goal of the tutorial sometimes when the code lingo is not understood.  I was overwhelmed once, too.  Even after a couple year using Quest, I still need to ask for advice on the forums from time to time.  It's an ever-learning process, but is very enjoyable when you can start to understand the essential basics for game creation.</p>\n<p>On a side note, the desktop/download version is WAY less buggy and WAY more stable than the online version.  I have never used the online version, so my advice is strictly for the desktop version.  This may cause some stumbling along the way.  Download the desktop version ASAP!  =)</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n",
