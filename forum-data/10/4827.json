Only when the player successfully moves to a new location does the old location scroll up to make way for the new one.\n\nI can already see some problems with this idea, such as the fact that a particularity lengthy room description would force the parser off the bottom of the screen, meaning the player wouldn't be able to see what they're typing, but it's a thought.",
