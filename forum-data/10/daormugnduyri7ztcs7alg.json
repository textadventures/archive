I created a simple program, to give an opponent 4 attacks, and thus it would repeat the attack code each time for each attack and that it should attack the player with these 4 attacks, every time the player would use the command. This works properly the first time I use command. However, every time I use the command afterwards, the loop does not initiate. I've created debug commands to post on the screen what the current value is for the Boolean condition for the loop and it should be initiating the loop, but it isn't.\r\n\r\nWhy does a while loop OR a for loop only work once, with the use of a command but will refuse to work every time afterwards?",
