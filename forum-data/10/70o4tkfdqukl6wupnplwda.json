What if we start off, say, in the university. Then, we go through all those doors to all of the university's connecting worlds and complete those missions, which triggers an event:</p>\n<p>A spaceship arrives. That spaceship is the Second World Map, which leads to space-battles and such. Once you've completed all those, the spaceship goes through a black hole (or whatever) and you find yourself on prehistoric Earth (or whatever).</p>\n<p>Or is that too much?</p>\n\n",

      "HTML": "<p>I am going away middle of next week, and will be away for pretty much all August. I might get the chance to post here a bit, but will not have access to Quest, so will not be able to contibute until September.</p>\n<p>I would suggest someone start a Github repository for the project, and give access to anyone interested. Create a docs folder, and the a document that defines the conventions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Everything in your zone needs your initials as a prefix</li>\n<li>How player and game attributes will be named, what they are, what values they can take, and whose zone will change them.</li>\n<li>What libraries are being used</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Github supports markdown, like the forum, by the way.</p>\n<p>You could use the \"Issues\" feature as a forum.</p>\n<p>What I would like settled soon rather than later is the genre and basic premise, so I can start thinking about what I will put in my zone (and to a lesser extent, how combat and magic will be handled, if at all). If you are happy with the hub idea, you should be able to use it straight away; I wrote it to allow the hub itself to get updated later.</p>\n<p>Once the genre is set, you can start writing stuff, and if you come to something that might be contentious, start an issue on github.</p>\n\n",
