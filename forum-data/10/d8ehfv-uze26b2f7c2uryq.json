      "EditableText": "This appears to be a problem where a recent project ends up more than once in Quest's \"recent\" list in the registry. When it goes to build the recent list internally, it throws because more than one entry with the same filename exist. Looking at the code, I can't figure out (yet) how it gets into that state, but if you're willing to use \"regedit\", we can fix it.\r\n\r\nFollow these steps:\r\n1) Run \"regedit\" (e.g. press the Windows key and then hit \"R\" and then type \"regedit\" in the box that pops up.) If it asks to be able to make changes to the system, say \"yes\".\r\n2) Under Computer in the tree on the left, look for HKEY_CURRENT_USER and open that folder.\r\n3) Look for SOFTWARE under that and open the folder.\r\n4) Search down for Quest under that and open the folder.\r\n\r\nAs this is the PlayBrowser, the key you care about is the one named \"Recent\". (If it were the EditBrowser one in the callback, you would have to focus on the EditorRecent key.)\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to fix this is to simply delete the Recent key (right-click on the word \"Recent\" and then choose \"Delete\" from the popup menu. Choose yes to confirm). Alternatively, you can open the Recent key (click on it) and look through the list of items for the ones beginning with \"Recent\", to see which entry is duplicated and remove only that one. \r\n\r\nNote that if you do delete this key, then when you open Quest, the \"recent\" list on the Play tab will be empty until you begin playing games anew. I assume that is preferable to not being to open Quest at all!\r\n\r\nLet me know if that makes sense or not and (if you try it) whether it works!\r\n",
