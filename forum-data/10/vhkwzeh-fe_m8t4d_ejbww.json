Do you need the `pokeballcount` attribute later on? If not, you could probably make it easier to maintain by using one of the core functions::\r\n```\r\nobjname = GetUniqueElementName(\"pokeball\")\r\ncreate (objname)\r\nobj = GetObject (objname)\r\n```\r\n\r\n>     obj.parent = player.inventory\r\nI think someone already mentioned that the `.inventory` is probably an error.\r\n\r\n>     obj.displayverbs = Split(\"Look at;Drop;Use;Take\", \";\")\r\nAll this does is adds \"Drop\" to the verbs menu when you're not holding the object. You could replace this with the two lines Pixie suggested, or you could just remove it (because the `defaultobject` type's displayverbs are \"Look At;Take\" and its inventoryverbs are \"Look At;Use;Drop\". If you want to add other displayverbs, you should list them separately like Pixie suggested, but if you just want the default verbs, you can omit them.\r\n\r\n>     obj.look = ProcessText(\"A \" + obj.alias + \", use it.\")\r\nThe call to ProcessText does nothing because there are no text processor commands in that string. You can just put:\r\n```\r\nobj.look = \"A \" + obj.alias + \", use it.\"\r\n```\r\nor even\r\n```\r\nobj.look = \"A Pokeball, use it.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n>     obj.use => {\r\n>       player.catchrate = player.catchrate + 1\r\n>     }\r\nThis sets up a `use` verb, which should work. However, it seems a little odd. If the player types \"use pokeball\", the game increases their catchrate stat by 1. So what's to stop them just using the ball a hundred times before they try to catch anything?\r\nIf this is just placeholder code, then you probably already fixed that issue.\r\n\r\n> How do I make a special command, maybe verb?\r\n\r\nI think you already know how to make a command. If you mean you want to add a verb to the object you're creating, you should look for the verb definition. For example, if you want to be able to throw the ball you're creating, look for the 'throw' verb in your game. In full code view it looks like this:\r\n```\r\n  <verb name=\"throw\">\r\n    <pattern>throw #object#</pattern>\r\n    <property>throw</property>\r\n    <defaulttemplate>DefaultThrow</defaulttemplate>\r\n  </verb>\r\n```\r\nThe line you're interested in is `<property>throw</property>`. This tells you that to make an object throwable, you would need to do something like:\r\n```\r\nobj.throw => {\r\n  // Insert code here\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor most verbs, the property is probably the same as the verb, but it isn't always, so it's a good idea to check.\r\n\r\n> And can I modify take for this object too?\r\n\r\nYep. Just set the `take` attribute to be a script.\r\n```\r\nobj.take => {\r\n  // some script here\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis isn't quite the same as a verb; because you can also set the `obj.take` attribute to `true` (object can be taken normally) or `false` (displays the default message to say it can't be taken).",
