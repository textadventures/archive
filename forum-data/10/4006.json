      "EditableText": "So I'm looking to replace all of the default error templates such as &quot;I don't understand that command&quot; with a single catch all dynamic template that cycles through multiple responses. Because I want to use a dynamic template I can't just replace the text in the templates UnrecognisedCommand and UnresolvedObject, I need to alter the scripts that cause those templates to be printed. I've modified the function UnresolvedCommand to take care of cases where an object isn't recognised, but it doesn't cover cases where the verb or command itself does not exist. I've scoured the default functions and object types and haven't had any luck so far. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nEDIT: Don't worry, after half an hour of searching with no luck, I find found what I was after almost immediately after I posted this. (It was in the function HandleSingleCommand.) I must have glanced over it and missed it the first time. Thanks for reading though.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",

The current system gives the player an indication of why his command failed (eg the verb was not recognised, or the noun, or whatever). Sounds like your system will not do that, which may make your game more frustrating for players. Better to have numerous cycling dynamic templates, I would suggest.",

If the verb or command doesn't exist it just says &quot;I don't understand your command.&quot; If the object doesn't exist, it says &quot;I can't see that.&quot; Seeing those same 2 outputs over and over again is what gets frustrating; all I've done is expand the pool of possible responses to those scenarios to make it a bit less monotonous.

If the message changes, then I will (at first) think that my different input has produced a different response, since I'm searching desperately for clues. I will learn over time that the different messages all actually mean the same thing (at which point, the frustration is the same), but in the interim, I will be frustrated *and* going down random paths, reading significance into something that is not significant, and ultimately just being more frustrated because the game was actually making it harder for me by not being consistent in what it's telling me. \n\nI can see the motivation for this being that you want the game to not seem so fixed - that it's a bit more variable and dynamic... that more than the frustration factor, which is not really alleviated by varying the message.
