The name of the rooms I want to go to are \"kitchen\" and \"yard\" but when I type \"go to kitchen\" or \"go to yard\" my game says \"you can't go there.\" I don't want the player to have to type go north or go in because that doesn't make any sense. I checked, and the exits are visible, not locked, and they're not a look direction.\r\n\r\nSecondly, is there any way to make it so the player can only do a specific amount of things each day? My game is set in an apocalyptic world so I want the player to be able to to three things each day like scout around or raid a store. Then it turns night and they can't to anything outside their house. But I don't want things like eating or reading to count towards that.\r\n\r\nI'm a noob so any help is appreciated. :)",
