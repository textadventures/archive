Engines like Quizlet are useful but less flexible than Quest.\n\nOn the note of flexibility, what I'm trying to do is have Quest search input for certain keywords, and react to those keywords. So, example:\n\nIf the user is prompted with the question:\nWhy was blood such an important fluid among the early peoples of the Americas?\n\nAnd the answer is:\nThey believed that the god's blood, which came in the form of rain, allowed the crops to grow. They also used blood in sacrifices. It was shed to feed and repay the gods and save the world from destruction.\n\nThen what I want is for them to type that, and for Quest to pick up on the keywords &quot;rain&quot; and &quot;sacrifice&quot;/&quot;sacrifices&quot;. That way they do not need a word-for-word identical answer, but still must make sure to have the right information.\n\nSo, how can I do this? Would I be able to do this with the simple tools of Quest or will I have to delve into some more complicated coding? I'd prefer the first, but am willing to learn the second - just understand I am totally ignorant of anything it involves.",
