I would like for the game to provide a pop-up menu at the beginning of the game asking you to select a race from a list by clicking on it. When you select the race, the window closes and it applies attributes of that race to the player. How do you set up the race to choose from in the editor, say &quot;Human&quot; and &quot;Elf&quot; with just basic attributes such as &quot;health&quot;, and then run a script to make a selection and apply the attribute to the player?",
