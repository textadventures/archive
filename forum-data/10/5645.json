I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here ! \nSecondary question _ The thread concerning image control shows how to superimpose one image on top of another and also how to change opacity. Would I be right in thinking it possible to use these techniques to fade from one image to another given a suitable trigger( although perhaps this would require some Javascript to set up a loop which increments a variable defining opacity) . Just wondered if anyone could confirm that I am on the right lines here - if so I will do some more work on it .. thanks",

[/quote:1wt609gc]\nYou are not missing anything obvious, that is for sure.\n\nYou can use JQuery or plain JavaScript to add a link element to the head element. You need to use GetFileURL to the get the file location to ensure it works on-line and off-line (and I would check that it does work on both sooner rather than later). Have you tried the &quot;HTML Tools&quot; button when playing off-line? It is good for seeing how elements are arranged.\n\nThis thread might give some more clues.\n<!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=5111\">viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=5111</a><!-- l -->\n[quote:1wt609gc]Secondary question _ The thread concerning image control shows how to superimpose one image on top of another and also how to change opacity.
