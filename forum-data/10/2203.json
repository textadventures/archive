When I launch quest pro to play the games I have created it works fine.  it is when I launch QDK to create the game and then use run (the shuttle icon) all I see is the notepad script of the game, whereas it used to launch the game to run.\nI managed to find the problem in the script.  For some reason it opened an exit description but then finished it after all the object descriptions, so I re wrote that bit.  it seems to work OK.  It is just the 'run' change that I want to return.\n\nI pressed the restore File association from Quest and it made no difference to the QDK.  I can launch the re-editted version of the game from Quest instead.",
