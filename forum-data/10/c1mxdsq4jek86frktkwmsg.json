Well, except I get the Danish translation of the \"DefaultOops\" from the language file.\r\nI tried creating a new game, this time in English, with the same rooms and exits, and this time it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nI am completely new to Quest, but wondered if I can do something to fix the Danish language file - or if someone can tell me why I get the DefaultOops every time I test the game in Danish.\r\n\r\n[oh, and PS: I have also tried the browser version of Quest.
