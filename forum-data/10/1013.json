Also Quest doesn't deal in decimal places, only whole numbers, so division often doesn't produce the result you'd expect.  Added to that you can only use very simple expressions.  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /><!-- s:shock: --> \n\nApart from making sure your points variable still makes sense if divided by 5,  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->  what you need to do is break the operation down into two stages, set up another numeric variable and set it to %points% / 5, then set gold to %gold% + %another_numeric_variable_name%.\n\nAl",
