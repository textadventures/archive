      "EditableText": "It depends on how it will play out. If the player uses the horse and cart to instantly get to a different location, then it is the same as a bus route. They may get complicated if you have a choice of vehicles, and also if you want to track the location of vehicles. I guess you would have locations that are car parks, and if there is a horse and cart there you can use it to travel to another car park.\r\n\r\nIf the player gets on the cart then moves in a specific direction to navigate across the map, a follower or container would be the way to go (essentially the cart is just a really big rucksack).",
