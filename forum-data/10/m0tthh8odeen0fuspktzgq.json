      "EditableText": "Hello! I'm very new to this all and am creating a gamebook. I know that gamebooks are far less popular than text adventures, but I've already started and don't want to start over. I need assistance with creating a timer in a gamebook. I'm still not sure whether this is possible or not. \r\nFor example, I want to set a timer that starts when you enter _x_ page. If you don't make it to _y_ page within the time limit, you are shown _z_ page. (Which is basically the page that shows you that you have lost.) I was also wondering whether you can put silent music in as a timer, and maybe when it ends you are shown to page _z_. I'm not sure.\r\nCan anyone help me to set this timer? Is it possible? Thank you!",

However, you can have a javascript timer.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n<pre><code>JS.eval(\"window.<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: blue\">timername</em> = setTimeout(function () {sendCommand('<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: green\">page z</em>')}, <em style=\"font-family: initial; color: purple\">25000</em>);\")</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThis uses the name of a command, and simulates the player clicking on a link to it. The time is specified in milliseconds, so my example would send you to page z after 25 seconds.\r\n\r\nAnd then on page y, you would cancel the timer:\r\n<pre><code>JS.eval(\"if (window.<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: blue\">timername</em>) { clearTimeout(window.<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: blue\">timername</em>); window.<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: blue\">timername</em> = 0;}\")</code></pre>",
