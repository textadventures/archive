The 'escape' character in quest is mainly used to tell quest to display the double quote in the outputted string, I don't think quest really has the 'escape' character coded to be used for much else, unlike what it's used for in the main languages (newline, etc etc etc). Quest uses the 'br' and other such XML-like tags instead.\r\n\r\nI can't remember at the moment if quest's 'escape' character is a forward-slash or a backward-slash (I haven't been using them for awahile in quest), so try using both, and seeing if they work with the 'n' (newline) and/or the double quote.",
