      "EditableText": "Hello, and thank you in advance for whatever advice you can offer! I’m having some trouble with the automatically generated object lists when either using an object without specifying a second object (ie ‘Shoot slingshot’) or something like ‘look at vines’ when you’re carrying a coil of vine in a room where there’s already a visible scenery object ‘hanging vine.’\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the menus are all blank. For example: (shoot slingshot) at which object? 1, 2, 3 will appear,  but there are no object names listed beside the numbers. However, if you select any one of the numbers they will correspond to an object in the room (choosing 1 refers to a tree, 2 to a wall) and the relevant action will occur normally.\r\n\r\nI feel like there is a step I’ve missed somewhere in the game settings. I’ll mention that all of the objects in question have names and aliases, as well as alternative names, and all are visible (though some may not be taken and/or are scenery).\r\n\r\nI’ve searched the forums for several days and haven’t come across an answer, but I’m also new to Quest and so I’m not sure exactly what questions to ask or keywords to look for.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
