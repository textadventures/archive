I eventually figured out it had something to do with the exits in the few rooms I was encountering the error in.\n\nIt turns out apostrophes are a line delimiter and so on, and that I was getting an error because my exit aliases contained apostrophes.\n\nI tried to escape the apostrophes with partial success: if I put a backslash before the apostrophes the Javascript is satisfied, no more error message, but the backslash is still printed when the game lists the exits.\n\nCould somebody point me to the function that is in charge of translating the Javascript alias into what is printed on the screen so I could fix it?  Does anybody know of a less intrusive method of fixing it?",
