      "EditableText": "The code you're looking for is Get Input. You call Get Input, and then the player has to type something in. The game will create the 'result' variable to store it briefly, which you can use in an if-then-else. Like so:\r\n```\r\nget input {\r\nif (result=\"Whatever Password\"){\r\nmsg(\"That's the password! Insert other unlocking stuff in this part of the code.\")\r\n}\r\nelse{\r\nmsg(\"That's not the password! Insert other wrong-password stuff in this part of the code.\")\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHope this helps!",
