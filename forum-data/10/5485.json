Plus I also a line break at the end of every hyperlink, so it would space out and be more readable. But the problem is that if there is too much, the screen automatically scrolls down to the bottom, even if there is nothing at the botttom, which gets annoying real quick. Is there a way to disable that? And also, is there a way, that I could have hyperlinks space out horizontally as well, and not only vertically?",
