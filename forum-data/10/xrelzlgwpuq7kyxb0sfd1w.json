But it's best to avoid it.</p>\n<p>You'd need to set up a normal function in Quest (preferrably with only one parameter), then call the function via an <code>ASLEvent()</code> from JS (which is being called from Quest through some Chromium browser interface thingy)...</p>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>Okay.  My brain froze up for a second.  What were we talking about?</p>\n<p>Oh yeah!</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;function name=\"JsTest\" parameters=\"param\"&gt;\n    msg(\"DEBUGGING MESSAGE: Running JsTest\")\n    msg(\"DEBUGGING MESSAGE: JsTest(\"+param+\")\")\n    game.js_test_variable = param\n    msg(\"DEBUGGING MESSAGE: game.js_test_variable is now set to: \"+game.js_test_variable+\".\")\n  &lt;/function&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, you use JS to pass the string you enter through an ASLEvent to the Quest function:</p>\n<pre><code>JS.ASLEvent(\"JsTest\",\"Hello, jmne!\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>OR</p>\n<pre><code>JS.eval(\"ASLEvent('JsTest','Hello,jmne!');\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>OR</p>\n<pre><code>JS.eval(\"var testVar = prompt('Enter the test variable.');ASLEvent('JsTest',testVar);\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>OR, if you actually want a JS function defined:</p>\n<pre><code>JS.eval(\"setTestVar = function(tstVar){ASLEvent('JsTest',tstVar);};\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that, you could simply:</p>\n<pre><code>JS.setTestVar(\"Hello, jmne!\")\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, after about 1 or 2 seconds, you could:</p>\n<pre><code>msg(game.js_test_variable)\n</code></pre>\n<p>...and that should print:</p>\n<samp>\nHello, jmne!\n</samp>\n\n",
