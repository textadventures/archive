So a turnscript with a `resolve` script attribute will run before the player's action.

This could be used so that someone can't pick a lock while being attacked, for example; or you could have a fast \"distract\" command that can prevent an enemy attacking\r\n        * `final` - cleaning up temporary variables, etc\r\n\r\nIn this setup, you would use `after_round` for something like a turn counter, and `after_turn` for updating the sidebar and similar things. Turnscripts could be repurposed as status effects; equipped to the player or NPCs, or to a room. Weapons/equipment could also have the same scripts, which would be run each turn. This makes it easy for the user to create a status effect that messes with a particular part of the turn sequence, without needing to adapt it for individual commands.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
