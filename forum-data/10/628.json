      "EditableText": "I once posted a question on how to change the color to something other than the ones quest comes with. The way to do it was supposed to be by doing [code:2nngqyam]foreground &lt;&amp;hff0000&gt;[/code:2nngqyam] and changing the numbers around. I tried it for a while yesterday, and almost everything I tried was a light or dark blue. I tried &quot;aa&quot; &quot;bb&quot; &quot;cc&quot; &quot;dd&quot; &quot;ee&quot; and &quot;ff,&quot; and a large combination of numbers. However, after all that time experimenting, I only came up with 2 different colors. [code:2nngqyam]&lt;&amp;haa0065&gt;[/code:2nngqyam] is a purple color (which can be varied in darkness), and [code:2nngqyam]&lt;&amp;haa9000&gt;[/code:2nngqyam] is a turquoise looking color. Alex posted a default or test, which, if I remember correctly was,   [code:2nngqyam]&lt;&amp;hff0000&gt;[/code:2nngqyam] That was supposed to be red, but was actually blue. Am I doing something wrong, or did I just not find the right codes? Because I used an extensive amount of letters/numbers combinations. I was looking for colors like orange, brown, light green, light blue, pink, tan, deep red, etc. Does anyone know how to get them or what code gets them? Thanks.",
