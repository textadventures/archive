Quest is marketed as a tool for writing text adventures and aimed specifically at non-programmers. Yet to make head or tail of the source code, you need to have at least basic programming knowledge, or be prepared to learn it.

I suppose if you had a resolution high enough (over 1280x1024 - as it seems OK to me, and if you find it hard at 1280x1024 than I suggest a lower resolution is for you) then it would be unlegible.</blockquote><br/><br/>I have my resolution set to 1280x1024 and override the font sizes to make everything slightly bigger for added legibility. But Quest's text entry line seems to remain permanently small. It's not impossible to read, just too small for comfortable reading.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Tr0n wrote:</cite>The many command thingy, just add:<br/><pre><code>\tcommand &lt;#command#/#command2#&gt; &#123;<br/>\t\texec &lt;#command#&gt;<br/>\t\texec &lt;#command2#&gt;<br/>\t&#125;</code></pre>Above any other command in your game. PRESTO!!<br/>Took my 3 hours to actually realise such a simple thing - but whatever <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> .</blockquote><br/><br/>To be honest, I'm kind of baffled why this isn't included in Quest by default. It's a basic ingredient in every text adventure design system, it's possible to do in Quest and yet it's something that has to be enabled by the game writer - assuming the game writer is even aware you can do this sort of thing.<br/><br/>Is it possible from the QDK or only from the source code? By the look of things, it's likely to be a source code only thing.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Tr0n wrote:</cite>I think development has been rather slow, and the fact that Quest code can be rather difficult and VERY limiting, that has stopped people using it so much. There's also the market it's aimed at: people who don't know how to program.</blockquote><br/><br/>I think that's probably hit the nail right on the head. Quest is marketed as a tool for writing text adventures and aimed specifically at non-programmers. Yet to make head or tail of the source code, you need to have at least basic programming knowledge, or be prepared to learn it. And if you're going to learn a programming language, why bother with one that hardly anyone is using and which has a terrible reputation?<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Tr0n wrote:</cite>The handicapped comment was in relation to you wanting the GUI changed - the GUI shouldn't be changed radically, rather the OPTION's being there so that we may change it - handicapped people would probably find it simple to use Quest currently.</blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not sure why changing the interface would affect handicapped people one way or the other but then I don't know any handicapped people so...",
