All that needs to be finished is the QDK support for QuestNet games (very nearly done) and adding the relevant stuff to the documentation so you know how to use it. If things progress quickly I might be able to release it this weekend (although as always I'm not promising anything <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> )",

THEN i can start making a decent game, and with the game i make, it might draw people to start using Quest, as alot of people dont know VB/C++, and they are all so desperate to make an online MuD, and Quest is the only way to do it.  So good luck with that Alex, i cant wait, i really cant, not any longer, ive been waiting for months now  lol!\n\nThe limitations at the moment is one reason ive stopped using Quest, but when QuestNet is released, we can do more stuff, which will be really cool.  and i have a job now, so paying for it after ive messed about with it wont be hard AT all.",
