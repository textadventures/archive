How do I do this?[/quote:29n7sruq]\n\nThe problem is it isn't just the game file you want to back up. It's all files associated with it. So each time you create a new game it's good practice (imo) to have a dedicated folder for it (as opposed to having all your gamea saved into one folder). That's what is meant by a directory. Just right click the folder and select copy. Then find somewhere else on a different hard drive right click and select paste. Voila. You now have a copy of your entire game directory. \n\nWhat I suspect happened with you is you just saved the game elsewhere. But it will now look for all associated files there too hence you're getting an error.",
