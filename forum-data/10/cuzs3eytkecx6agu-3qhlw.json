It is just a poc for a deckbuilding game, and I'm working on the process of drawing and discarding cards with effects.\r\nI had high hopes for the devMode and maybe understanding where my code is bugged (but it is another topic)\r\n\r\nI thought we could see variables and more about the scripts created, but I don't understand how to use it with custom verbs (but that another topic)\r\n\r\nI just wanted to make sure :\r\n1) I could use DevMode in the web version \r\n2) This error was known or not important \r\n\r\nThanks !\r\n",
