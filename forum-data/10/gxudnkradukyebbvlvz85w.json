      "EditableText": "Hi Could anyone help me? I am creating an extremely basic game as part of my school homework. The game is very simple, all you have to do is find missing parts of an item (items have 2 or 3 missing parts), and then once you have these missing parts you can go to the correct item to fix it, and then use it or watch it. The first one I am trying to do is a television where the player needs to find two things, a picture tube and a speaker system. Once they have these 2 things they should be able to go to the TV, fix it, switch it on and then watch it. So far I have given the TV the feature of being switchable and inputted the message \"The TV does not work, it needs a picture tube and a speaker system.\" in the section \"Leave blank to allow the object to be turned on; give a message if it cannot be turned on (eg requires power or repair):\".  I have created a new verb \"fix\" for the tv and run a script, which is where i must be going wrong. The script is \"if player is carrying object, picture tube, \" then print message \"Great! You have inserted the picture tube into the television.\" I have done the same for if the player is carrying a speaker system as well. This is where I am getting stuck, I do not know how to get the program to recognise that it needs both items and once both have been used by using the fix verb, then the player is able to switch on the TV (or the TV gets switched on automatically after the 2 items have been founds which would also be fine) and then be able to watch the TV. I have created the watch verb and run the script \"If object is switched on, TV, then pint message and also play a a you tube video, but this is not working i think because the TV is not being switched on with the fix script i have done. I really hope this makes sense, i couldn't sleep in this morning and have been up since 6am trying to figure out what to do. Thank you so much to anyone that can help!",

      "EditableText": "(I'll explain in code view, because it's easier than looking up all the descriptions. Also assuming your object names are `picture tube`, `speaker`, and `television`)\r\n\r\nI think you probably want your 'fix' verb script to be something like this:\r\n```\r\nif (Got (picture tube)) {\r\n  MoveObject (picture tube, television)\r\n  msg (\"Great! You have inserted the picture tube into the television.\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (Got (speaker)) {\r\n  MoveObject (speaker, television)\r\n  msg (\"Great!

I put the parts you've used inside the television, so it's easy to check if they are installed.\r\n\r\nThe second part checks which parts are in there. If they're both there, we set the attribute `television.cannotswitchon` (labelled \"Leave blank to allow the object to be turned on; give a message if it cannot be turned on (eg requires power or repair):\" in the editor) to a blank string, so the TV can now be switched on.

      "EditableText": "Thank you so, so much, you are amazing...that code was perfect for what i wanted! I had to download the windows version and use the code view, but that helped an awful lot in understanding how the programme works. I was able to sort out all the rooms and I am so happy, so thank you again! I still need to input some more descriptive text but I am nearly there! I have tried to find out how I can make the game end though. I would like it so that when all the objects have been fixed with their relevant items then the game ends with a congratulation message. If you could once again point me in the right direction I would be most grateful....this is my code for the game so far (I know it is very simple, this is my 1st attempt at this plus the game has been designed for Ada Lovelace from the 1800's so the simpler the better I am thinking!)\r\n\r\n<asl version=\"580\">\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n  <game

I had to download the windows version and use the code view, but that helped an awful lot in understanding how the programme works. I was able to sort out all the rooms and I am so happy, so thank you again! I still need to input some more descriptive text but I am nearly there! I have tried to find out how I can make the game end though. I would like it so that when all the objects have been fixed with their relevant items then the game ends with a congratulation message. If you could once again point me in the right direction I would be most grateful....this is my code for the game so far (I know it is very simple, this is my 1st attempt at this plus the game has been designed for Ada Lovelace from the 1800's so the simpler the better I am thinking!)</p>\n\n\n",

quickly! &lt;br/&gt;It's been 175 years since your epic notes on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and here you can find out how far technology has come since then!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 rooms you can enter from here (either by selecting the blue links above or by using the compass you will see to the right of the screen) and each one contains a peice of 2018 technology, sadly though they are all missing crucial parts that they need in order to work.&lt;br/&gt;Take a look in this room for example, there is a picture tube typed in blue, that means you can select it, go ahead select it now and take a look.&lt;br/&gt;You can also take this item, take it now, you might need it later (see how your inventory fills up in the top right corner of the screen, and be aware that not all objects in blue can be taken but they can always be selected and interacted with in some way)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will always need to come back to the lobby to enter another room as you discover the technology of the 21st Century.&lt;br/&gt;Good luck Ada, I cannot imagine what you will think of the tecnology of 2018!\")\n    ]]&gt;&lt;/firstenter&gt;\n    &lt;onexit type=\"script\"&gt;\n

      "EditableText": "As far as checking for all of the objects being fixed, you would probably want to check this whenever an object is fixed. This means the code would be repeated in several places.\r\n\r\nTo make this simpler, it would probably be a good idea to create a *function* to check if the player has won the game. I'd suggest making a function called `CheckVictory`, and using a set of *flags* (attributes whose value is true or false) to check whether each item is fixed.\r\n\r\nSo either when the player fixes the television (after the `television.cannotswitchon = \"\"` line) or after the line that plays the youtube video, you would add 2 lines:\r\n```\r\n  television.fixed = true\r\n  CheckVictory()\r\n```\r\nand similar for the other fixable objects.\r\n\r\nThen you would create a CheckVictory function, whose script looks something like:\r\n```\r\nfixed_items = FilterByAttribute (AllObjects(), \"fixed\", true)\r\nif (ListCount (fixed_objects) = 8) {\r\n  msg (\"Congratulations! You have fixed everything!\")\r\n  finish()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis uses three of the core functions that you might not have come across yet:\r\n* `AllObjects` gets a list of all the objects in the game\r\n* `FilterByAttribute` filters a list, to find the ones that meet some criteria. In this case, it finds all the objects whose \"fixed\" attribute has been set to `true`\r\n* `ListCount` gives you the number of objects in a list.
