I don't know any commands in the scripting language of QDK and lean solely on the graphical interface, but I'd like to change that. I was wondering if anybody here knows of a good rescourse, like a series of lessons or tutorials, that will give me an overview of the scripting language. \n\nI know C++, so hopefully it won't be too dificult for me to pick up, I just can't find any good overviews to start with (and trying to get it from the help files isn't exactly easy) Thank you in advance for any help; and now that I've found this website, you'll probably be hearing a lot of dumb questions from my directon.\n\nThe Razor",
