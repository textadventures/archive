Under the Player tab I made an attribute ([url:1iekvttd]http&#58;//i&#46;imgur&#46;com/iGdPfLc&#46;jpg[/url:1iekvttd]) that shows up as Title: when I play the game ([url:1iekvttd]http&#58;//i&#46;imgur&#46;com/MjuE01f&#46;jpg[/url:1iekvttd]). In the room thats supposed to add a title on the status bar I used the set script ([url:1iekvttd]http&#58;//i&#46;imgur&#46;com/9s2OU1h&#46;jpg[/url:1iekvttd]) and when I played the game I got an error saying:\nError running script&#058; Error compiling expression 'title': Unknown object or variable 'title'\n Is there something I'm doing wrong? How do I fix it?",
