According to some video quite alot, but there arent many videos out there, so before i begin, here are some questions which are very important to my game idea\r\n1. Can you program interactable npcs, which can give you quests?\r\n2. Map- is it possible to have a room acting as a map, so when player presses a letter, eg “M”, that said room will open up with an image, giving a player some idea, where he/she is? \r\n3. Vehicles or other transport which player can interact with/use\r\nThats plenty for now, thanks",
