Imagine that 5.x is open source, and the entire community is relying on this new programmer to make a wonderful new feature come to life, and suddenly the entire release is threatened because that person must withdraw from the project for whatever possible reason.  \n\nThree, vision: turnover in programmers might result in new programmers instigating a mid-stream change to the program that leads it in a direction not originally intended, either by the original person who touched that bit of programming, or, by the community at large, and then work would be needed to steer the program back on track.\n\nSo, oversight and follow-through would be my concerns.  While daunting in its size, I'm sure, for one person to program, if you make it open source, there may be trade-offs that dim the program's popularity.  \n\nOne thing you could do, possibly, as a half-step to opening up to the possibility of people helping you, is for you to make the backbone of the program, and other people write modules for it, so one person is writing an array handler, another is writing a text parser, etc., and the modules are granular enough that the sudden loss of any programmer's time wouldn't pull the carpet from beneath the project.  You wouldn't want the same programmer who is burning out on writing a portion of the GUI be the same person who is burning out on script parsing, or what have you, but cutting the program's development into a lot of tiny pieces means lots of programmers touching it at the same time, or having them tackle those pieces one piece at a time, and therein slowing release. \n\nNot sure what is the best answer, and I feel for you as far as the need to offload some of the programming overhead.
