I wouldn't know more about that, as I'm on linux and can't run the desktop editor.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the web editor, you can't edit attributes directly, but you can set them in a script. For example, in your start script you could do:\r\n```\r\nsome_object_name.changedparent => {\r\n  // new script goes here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that replaces the default script. Depending what you're doing, it might be a good idea to make sure you include some parts of the default `changedparent` script.\r\nFor reference, this is what the built-in changedparent script does:\r\n```\r\n      if (game.pov = this) {\r\n        if (IsDefined(\"oldvalue\")) {\r\n          OnEnterRoom(oldvalue)\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n          OnEnterRoom(null)\r\n        }\r\n        if (game.gridmap) {\r\n          MergePOVCoordinates\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      this.hasbeenmoved = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich breaks down as:\r\n* `if (game.pov = this) {` - if this object is currently the player\r\n     * `if (IsDefined(\"oldvalue\")) {` - if `parent` previously had a value\r\n          * `OnEnterRoom(oldvalue)` - Run the room exit scripts for `oldvalue`, room enter scripts for the current room, and show the room description\r\n     * `else {`\r\n          * `OnEnterRoom(null)` - Run room enter scripts and show the room description\r\n     * `if (game.gridmap) {` - if the map is enabled\r\n          * `MergePOVCoordinates` - some stuff related to working out where the new room should be drawn on the map\r\n* `this.hasbeenmoved = true` - the only thing that matters for non-player objects; set a flag to say that the object has been moved\r\n",
