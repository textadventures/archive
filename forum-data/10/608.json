For example, I have a flashlight, and if the player drops it, I move them to &quot;Dark Room&quot; where they can't move unless they pick it up again. I want that if they pick up the flashlight, it will move them back to the last room that they were in. (In QDK please) Thanks",

I did that when the player &quot;drops&quot; the flashlight, set a variable &quot;oldroom,&quot; and variable contents are &quot;#quest.currentroom#.&quot; And move the player to &quot;darkroom.&quot; Then, when player picks up the flashlight, (if #quest.currentroom# = darkroom, of course) then I tried two things. I tried, move player to room, #oldroom#, which didn't work. I can see why, as #oldroom# is a variable, not a room, but it contains #quest.currenroom#, so how to I make it take you there? I also did &quot;take player to room #quest.currentroom#,&quot; but that didn't either work. How to I implement what you said in your earlier posting? Thanks",
