It depends a little about how much you want the player bleeds. If you use it in a turn script, it will happen every time the player uses a command. If you attach it to rooms, it will happen every time the player moves around.\r\n\r\nThe bleeding itself is not hard to create, and there are multiple ways to do it. You may have a bleeding attribute that I suppose will start at zero. Every turn (or at room) the player's health is health - bleeding. \r\n\r\nThe other way is just flag it. player.bleed would be your flag and IF the flag is TRUE, then health is health - X, where X is a fixed value for bleeding.\r\n\r\nAs you want to wear off the bleeding through time, perhaps you'll need the attribute instead the flag. The attribute \"bleeding\" may be changed over time, what means your rooms or turns will need a script to make bleed - bleed - X every time. Pay attention to check if bleeding is below zero, or the player will increase health over time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what you will need is a function, which is a collection of scripts excecuted all together at once. At every adequate moment, the game runs the script and applies bleeding, reduces bleeding and checks if bleeding is below zero, turning it into zero if it is too low.\r\n\r\nI never used turn scripts, but I know if you put this function on \"before enetering\" or \"after entering\" each room, it will work. But the only way I know doing it is placing the function at every single room you create, unless you use turn scripts.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot figure out how to create the scripts and the function, I may give you a hand on code limited by my scarse knowledge.",
