      "EditableText": "The other day I got back into Quest, got started and added 2 libraries (ConvLib and CombatLib) after only building a little bit. It was all rolling well until I ran across this error repeatedly after going through more than one room:\r\n\r\n```Error running script: Error compiling expression 'game.pov.turncount + 1': ArithmeticElement: Operation 'Add' is not defined for types 'Object' and 'Int32'```\r\n\r\nI went online and managed to find a forum post to resolve the issue by adding a turncount attribute to the player object. Going back in again though, I'm now faced with this after moving more than 1 room:\r\n\r\n```Error running script: Error compiling expression 'ListCombine(game.attackers, game.friends)': FunctionCallElement: Could find not function 'ListCombine(Object, Object)'```\r\n\r\nI thought the issue might have been with having started the game without having added the Combat and Conv Libs so I made a new game from scratch. Didn't copy the code but started rebuilding from the editor and did nothing until I had both libraries added. Again, I got the error when I moved more than one room. \r\n\r\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated\r\n\r\n",
