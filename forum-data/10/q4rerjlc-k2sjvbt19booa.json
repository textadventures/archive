After entering the third of three stalls, a couple of Dingoes walk in to use the shower.  3.  Listen to their conversation closely - it may be helpful.  4.  Eventually, one of the Dingoes is going to shower IN YOUR STALL!!  5.  This Dingo needs to think the stall is occupied.  6.  Is there any way you can make him think the stall is occupied BEFORE he open the curtain?  7.  ... ... ... 8.  Use the lever.  9.  When you return to the shower stalls, go examine the shower stalls that these two men used.  You'll find your \\\"beard\\\" in there.  Bleck.  10.  You'll need to fix the beard to your face with something.  I'm sure you can find something sticky around somewhere.

It is far too windy for an individual to crawl through the ventilation system surrounding the lab.  (see ventilation system hints if you can't access the VS above the lab).  4.  Scientists are always super cautious around foreign smells.  Do you have anything that is \\\"smellable\\\" and is a dangerous?  5.  Check the laundry room.  6.  Hmm... don't mix bleach with what?  7.  There is one place that smells ripely of ammonia.  Go smell the air there.  8.  You will need your little companion for this part, too.  Sorry, Blerk!  9.  That's all I want to give here.  Figure the rest out.  If you can't, ask on the comment section of the game.  10.  There is only one exit from the lab and it is very close to the infirmary.  Could you get into the lab if sick scientists are roaming around?  Probably not, so you'll need to lock them in the lab.  11.  Do you have anything that you could use to bar the door shut from the outside?  12.  You'll find what you need in the mechanics room.  13.  Once inside, you should know what you should do.

You'll need to wear the cooler because as soon as the ice is out of the cooler, it will melt.  But... <br/>6.  How can you wear a cooler?   Well, you can't, but someone else can as long as there are holes for the legs.<br/>7.  But cutting holes in the legs just makes it leak, so you will need a sealant of some kind.  Remember, you are using this thing in the <i>DUCT</i> work.  Get it?<br/>8.  Now that you should be able to wear the cooler, you will still find it is not enough.  You'll need to create a cold reaction in there...<br/>9.  Remember, you are a science teacher.  You have seen your fair share of really, really lame science fair projects involving the two things you will need!<br/>10.  Pour them both in and you should have a cold enough cooler to make your way through!<br/>11.

You'll obviously need a light.<br/>2.  There is just such a thing in the mechanics room, but...<br/>3.  The batteries in it are dead!<br/>4.  So... find you some batteries.  They are hidden somewhere in the garage (see garage hints if you are stuck)</font><br/><br/>TO ACCESS THE 'TOO WINDY' AREA:<font color=\\\"white\\\"><br/>1.  You'll need an item that will weigh \\\"you\\\" down a bit more.<br/>2.  You'll also need something to tie that object to \\\"you\\\".<br/>3.  You can find a sturdy rope in the garage.<br/>4.

You still need a beard, however.  6.  Have you explored all of the shower stalls?

After entering the third of three stalls, a couple of Dingoes walk in to use the shower.  3.  Listen to their conversation closely - it may be helpful.  4.  Eventually, one of the Dingoes is going to shower IN YOUR STALL!!  5.  This Dingo needs to think the stall is occupied.  6.  Is there any way you can make him think the stall is occupied BEFORE he open the curtain?  7.  ... ... ... 8.  Use the lever.  9.  When you return to the shower stalls, go examine the shower stalls that these two men used.  You'll find your \\\"beard\\\" in there.  Bleck.  10.  You'll need to fix the beard to your face with something.  I'm sure you can find something sticky around somewhere.

It is far too windy for an individual to crawl through the ventilation system surrounding the lab.  (see ventilation system hints if you can't access the VS above the lab).  4.  Scientists are always super cautious around foreign smells.  Do you have anything that is \\\"smellable\\\" and is a dangerous?  5.  Check the laundry room.  6.  Hmm... don't mix bleach with what?  7.  There is one place that smells ripely of ammonia.  Go smell the air there.  8.  You will need your little companion for this part, too.  Sorry, Blerk!  9.  That's all I want to give here.  Figure the rest out.  If you can't, ask on the comment section of the game.  10.  There is only one exit from the lab and it is very close to the infirmary.  Could you get into the lab if sick scientists are roaming around?  Probably not, so you'll need to lock them in the lab.  11.  Do you have anything that you could use to bar the door shut from the outside?  12.  You'll find what you need in the mechanics room.  13.  Once inside, you should know what you should do.

You obviously need to cool down to pass through.&lt;br/&gt;2.  Ice will do the trick... partially.&lt;br/&gt;3.  But you'll need an appropriate container to carry it in.&lt;br/&gt;4.  A thermal cooler should do the trick (you can find one in the... ... ... pantry)&lt;br/&gt;5.  You'll need to wear the cooler because as soon as the ice is out of the cooler, it will melt.  But... &lt;br/&gt;6.  How can you wear a cooler?   Well, you can't, but someone else can as long as there are holes for the legs.&lt;br/&gt;7.  But cutting holes in the legs just makes it leak, so you will need a sealant of some kind.  Remember, you are using this thing in the &lt;i&gt;DUCT&lt;/i&gt; work.  Get it?&lt;br/&gt;8.  Now that you should be able to wear the cooler, you will still find it is not enough.  You'll need to create a cold reaction in there...&lt;br/&gt;9.  Remember, you are a science teacher.  You have seen your fair share of really, really lame science fair projects involving the two things you will need!&lt;br/&gt;10.  Pour them both in and you should have a cold enough cooler to make your way through!&lt;br/&gt;11.  Ask on the comments section of the game if you are stuck here.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO ACCESS THE 'MAX SECURITY GRATE:&lt;font color=\\\"white\\\"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  You'll need to make sure you don't get shocked.&lt;br/&gt;2.  There are two things you an do to lessen the shock factor.&lt;br/&gt;3.  One thing you need you will find in the laundry room.  -- It often goes in the dryer.&lt;br/&gt;4.  The other thing you will need is some water.
