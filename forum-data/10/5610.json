Is there any way to recover it? Also, I'm using the Web version.\n\nFor those of you coming from the other thread, the room I deleted is the one where you set out on your journey. It had a lot of if statements when leaving to the east, as there are a bunch of things it checks for. Like if you forget your map, you get lost and it's instant game over. If you've acquired a vehicle then you have different random encounters than going on foot, ect.\n\nI'd really like to not have to re-do all that stuff.",
