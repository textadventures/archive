Is that nested if/then business creating some kind of redundancy issue? I'm at a loss.\n\nBTW: since it seems to be running the file, I have not changed the ASL version number in the code to 560 (562?). It is still listed as 550.\n\nSidenote: I really want to make a sequel to this now, but I feel like I should get &quot;part 1&quot; running smoothly first.",
