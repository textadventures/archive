I prefer printing messages rather than having expressions when working in Quest, I find them easier - mostly.\r\n\r\nOne thing I tend to have to use expressions for is ```CapFirst``` as Quest doesn't recognise ```{CapFirst(player.gender)```} or ```{CapFirst{player.gender}}``` in messages, through my current experience. Has anyone got a way to put this function into a message or am I doomed to expressions forever?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
