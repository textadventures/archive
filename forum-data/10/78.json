I have 5 hard drives in quite a few partitions and I have no problem knowing exactly where everything is. QDK has a recently used files list in the File menu, more than likely that will list one of the games you are recently working\n\nAutomatically loading a game isn't a good idea, but having an option like Quest and Questnet both have, that allows you to define what folder QDK starts browsing in(when you look for files to open) is a good idea. It's probably a small feature Alex overlooked as he's put it in his other applications.\n\nA more logical idea would be to have quest recognize it's own type of \"project files\" like many other programming applications do(example most C++ compilers and such). Though at the present time, no ASL game is complicated enough to require this now. Perhaps down the road when you want to include libraries, sounds, movies(for a text game? eh it could happen), and other associated files to then use with Qcompile to compile them into one smaller associated file. But, as I said, there wouldn't be a need for something like this for quite a while.",
