I've been looking through the forums for the last few days, trying to find my answers, but since I couldn't, I decided to make a new post with my questions.\n\n1. My dream was a MUD, because I want to interact with the users like a &quot;game master&quot;, but it seems it is somewhere between impossible and very difficult, is that true?\n2. Since this will be an &quot;endless&quot; game, I need a log in system, information stored database. Can or should that be made in Quest, html or something else?\n3. I want to track user progress, so I want to store their save game, and their &quot;score&quot;/achievements on my database. How would I go about doing something like that?\n4. Is it possible to make a chat to connects users even though they play in different games?\n5. If everything else is possible, is it possible to also make this game into an app for android and iPhone? Or is it better to just think html based?\n\nMy coding experience is pretty limited, made a few simple games in Action-script, basic html, and that's about it. \n\nHopefully my questions make sense to you guys, otherwise please ask me for more details. \nThank you for your time, I look very much forward to hearing your answers.\n\nFury",

The Quest code is all open-source, so it's able to be looked at to see how it works. You might be able to replicate on your website what the Quest website is doing (e.g set the right cookies or whatever that the web player looks for) and then have your own login system. You would need your webserver and database back end and then code how you want it all to work. I have not looked at what is open-sourced in the Quest code to know if it exposes the actual website code. I doubt it.\n3) This gets, again, into trying to change the existing website integration that Quest has. Quest already supports saving games. You would either have to see how the Quest code is interfacing with the website and try to replicate that so it just &quot;plugs in&quot; or you would have to customise the code to have it plug into whatever architecture you wish to use.\n4) That can be implemented entirely outside Quest as some sort of webpage control that lives on the same page as the Quest webplayer instance.\n5) Quest games can be converted to run on mobile platforms, but I don't know what's involved. There is a way to convert a Quest game to Javascript code using an experimental tool, but that hasn't been terribly successful either (based on what I've caught through the forum grapevine).\n\nAlex is the creator of Quest. I don't know to what extent he would want to or be able to help create a customized version of the Quest website (with extras like chat being for you to implement), but I imagine he might if the price was right!",
