The library needs Quest 3.11 [i:1g4b1zzf]or a later version[/i:1g4b1zzf] to work.  I am not aware of any problems being caused with QDK 3.52, I'm working with that combination in testing and all is O.K.\n\nDo you have other programs running when trying to use QDK?  I've noticed that if I start QDK with AOL software running I do have all manner of problems with running out of system resources.\n\nAl (MaDbRiT) Bampton",
