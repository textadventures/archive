      "EditableText": "a) What you are looking for is GetRandomInt and Switch. GetRandomInt does exactly what it sounds like, it gets a random integer from a minimum to a maximum, inclusive. In code, it looks like this:\r\n```\r\nGetRandomInt(1,6)\r\n```\r\nIt's not a block of code. It's something you put INTO the blocks of code.\r\n\r\nSwitch, in comparison, IS a block of code. Basically you tell it \"Depending on what THIS is, do this, this, or this.\" Think of it like if-then-else, but only for _lots of very simple things_. So you can do something like:\r\n```\r\nswitch (GetRandomInt(1,6)){\r\ncase(1){\r\nmove WhateverObject1 to WhateverRoom}\r\ncase(2){\r\nmove WhateverObject2 to WhateverRoom}\r\netc}\r\n```\r\nb) I don't fully understand what you mean by this. You mean add text to the room saying the object's arrived? Just use the Print block of code after you move the object.\r\nc) What you want for THIS is Menu. Menus are probably the single most useful block of code in all of quest. The way it works is it takes a list of strings, and gives the player a choice from each option. Then it does stuff depending on what was chosen. Basic format is, and pardon my psuedocode:\r\n```\r\nNewStringListForTestingMenu = new string list //Creates a new, empty string list out of the Set Variable Or Attribute block of code. Call it what you want.\r\nAdd \"Yes\" to NewStringListForTestingMenu //Adds the words Yes to an option in the list.\r\nAdd \"No\" to NewStringListForTestingMenu // Ditto for the words No\r\nShow menu with dialogue (\"Tell the player to pick Yes or No\") taking options from NewStringListForTestingMenu and Do/DoNot allow the player to enter whatever. Then, after they enter something{\r\nDo Stuff}\r\n```\r\nThe big thing to note is that when you enter stuff into a new menu, it creates a variable called 'result' to store it. So after the menu gets input, you can do Switch(result){case 1, case 2 etc} to do different stuff.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",
