(I can just hear myself badgering a parent like when I was a kid... &quot;Adrift's mom lets him have a comp.&quot;)\r\n\r\nAnyway I am announcing the first (and probably last) Christmas comp for Quest authors.  I am calling it:\r\n\r\nYULETIDE FROTH: CHRISTMAS QUEST COMP\r\n\r\nSo here are the rules:\r\n\r\n1.)Write a new game in Quest.  Make the damn thing short (10 rooms or less would be great but 15 is the absolute maximum number of locations).\r\n\r\n2.) The game must carry a Christmas theme.  (Feel free to twist &quot;christmas theme&quot; however you want.  Wanna give ol' Frosty a machine gun... go right ahead).  This must be a new, unreleased game.\r\n\r\n3.) Email it to me at <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:frothgames@yahoo.com\">frothgames@yahoo.com</a><!-- e -->.  I'll get with Alex and see about posting them all up together after the deadline on textadventures.co.uk.  The Deadline is: December 20th, 2007.\r\n\r\n4.)For judging purposes we will have to be practical about this.  Since there are less than ten of us, and only three of us might do this, and one of them will probably be me and my entry does not count beacuse I am running this, we will have allow the authors to vote on any game besides their own.  PM your scores to me (1-10) and I'll tab them up and post the winners.\r\n\r\n5.) Prizes:  I have $50 bucks for the winner.  I can not be the winner though I am going to write a game for this.  If you have any questions, just respond to this post or send me a message.  If you want to add a prize (hey Alex...how about adding a prize) respond to this post and I'll update it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know everyone is busy writing a text game longer than War and Peace but take a week off and do this.  Do it for Quest.  Do it for Christmas.  Stop reading this and do it right now.  \r\n\r\nAlso, do me a favor and respond to this post and let me know if what you think of this.",

Don't try to &quot;kill&quot; anything or &quot;unlock&quot; anything.  Just USE objects on other things and LOOK at things.  That should do it.  ENJOY!\nAlso, I had more practice in the past on Quest 3.53 so hopefully it should still work on 4.2 or whatever.\n\nFOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CONVERT THIS... copy the code and save it in Notepad, change the extension to .asl and you should be able to play it.  \n\n[b:2yb9xhjn]EDIT[/b:2yb9xhjn]\nOk, I had another brief minute to play through the game and sort of beta test it.  I am not going to change the code as I have already pasted it.  I don't think it would be fair.  I will give you another couple of errors I noticed in my haste to finish the game for today's entry.\nBe aware of the right panel as you play.  Certain objects and exits become available without the room description telling you so.  Here are some things to be aware of.  \n- In the toy room after you look at the certain objects in the room, weapons appear.  When you &quot;take all&quot;, the only response it gives you is that you can't pick up the shelf or the chest or the bag.  It does not tell you that you actually picked up the weapons.  Double check your inventory afterwards by typing &quot;i&quot; or &quot;inventory&quot;\n- In Christmas Kevin's room, there is a southern exit that is not mentioned.  There is a keyhole that must be dealt with to continue south.  \n- In Hanukkah Hank's room after you defeat him, the description ends with &quot;press any key&quot; but nothing else happens.  But in fact, the EAST door becomes available.  Just go east after you beat him.\n\nI will give a simple tutorial soon after you have a chance to play it.

      "HTML": "This should work.  Most of the game, I did today.  Talk about crunch time.  Anyway.  Hopefully this works for you guys.  I just played to its completion moments ago.  Don't try to &quot;kill&quot; anything or &quot;unlock&quot; anything.  Just USE objects on other things and LOOK at things.  That should do it.  ENJOY!<br/>Also, I had more practice in the past on Quest 3.53 so hopefully it should still work on 4.2 or whatever.<br/><br/>FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CONVERT THIS... copy the code and save it in Notepad, change the extension to .asl and you should be able to play it.  <br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">EDIT</span><br/>Ok, I had another brief minute to play through the game and sort of beta test it.  I am not going to change the code as I have already pasted it.  I don't think it would be fair.  I will give you another couple of errors I noticed in my haste to finish the game for today's entry.<br/>Be aware of the right panel as you play.  Certain objects and exits become available without the room description telling you so.  Here are some things to be aware of.  <br/>- In the toy room after you look at the certain objects in the room, weapons appear.  When you &quot;take all&quot;, the only response it gives you is that you can't pick up the shelf or the chest or the bag.  It does not tell you that you actually picked up the weapons.  Double check your inventory afterwards by typing &quot;i&quot; or &quot;inventory&quot;<br/>- In Christmas Kevin's room, there is a southern exit that is not mentioned.  There is a keyhole that must be dealt with to continue south.  <br/>- In Hanukkah Hank's room after you defeat him, the description ends with &quot;press any key&quot; but nothing else happens.  But in fact, the EAST door becomes available.  Just go east after you beat him.<br/><br/>I will give a simple tutorial soon after you have a chance to play it.  There are fun extras in the first 3 or 4 rooms of the game so look at everything and use every object on every other object.<br/><br/><pre><code>' &quot;ChristmaKwanzakkah&quot;<br/>' Created with QDK 3&#46;53 - UNREGISTERED VERSION<br/><br/>define game &lt;ChristmaKwanzakkah&gt;<br/>\tasl-version &lt;350&gt;<br/>\tgametype singleplayer<br/>\tstart &lt;holiday bathroom&gt;<br/>\tgame author &lt;Steve the gaming guy&gt;<br/>\tgame info &lt;Created with QDK 3&#46;53 - UNREGISTERED EVALUATION VERSION&#46;&gt;<br/>\tstartscript {<br/>\t\tdo &lt;Intro&gt;<br/>\t\tmsg &lt;It's that time of year again&#46;  A time for crunching through the crowds and spreading Christmas cheer&#46;  Work your way through the trials of the season and destroy the bosses of Christmas to reach your goal&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46; but what is your goal?|n&gt;<br/>\t\tflag off &lt;shelf look&gt;<br/>\t\tflag off &lt;chest open&gt;<br/>\t\tflag off &lt;bag look&gt;<br/>\t}<br/>\tcommand &lt;take all&gt; {<br/>\t\tfor each object in &lt;#quest&#46;currentroom#&gt; {<br/>\t\t\tif property &lt;#quest&#46;thing#; stay&gt; then msg &lt;You can't pick up the #@quest&#46;thing#!&gt;<br/>\t\t\tif property &lt;#quest&#46;thing#; take&gt; then give &lt;#quest&#46;thing#&gt;<br/>\t\t}<br/>\t\tif got &lt;#quest&#46;thing#&gt; then msg &lt;You've already taken every visible item!&gt;<br/>\t}<br/>\tcommand &lt;get all&gt; for each object in &lt;#quest&#46;currentroom#&gt; if property &lt;#quest&#46;thing#; stay&gt; then msg &lt;You can't pick up the #quest&#46;thing#!&gt; else {if exists &lt;#quest&#46;thing#&gt; then give &lt;#quest&#46;thing#&gt;}<br/>\tcommand &lt;open #@thing#&gt; msg &lt;Nothing in this game needs to be opened or closed&#46;  If it does, just look at it and it should open&#46;  But don't close it&#46;  Not even the #thing#&#46;&gt;<br/>\tcommand &lt;close #@thing#&gt; msg &lt;Nothing in this game needs to be opened or closed&#46;  If it does, just look at it and it should open&#46;  But don't close it&#46;  Not even the #thing#&#46;&gt;<br/>\tcommand &lt;eat #@object#&gt; msg &lt;You attempt to eat the #object# but your jaw pops loudly and you cry like a little girl&#46;&gt;<br/>\tcommand &lt;eat the #@object#&gt; msg &lt;You attempt to eat the #object# but your jaw pops loudly and you cry like a little girl&#46;&gt;<br/>\tcommand &lt;hint&gt; msg &lt;Hint?

Talk about crunch time. Anyway. Hopefully this works for you guys. I just played to its completion moments ago. Don't try to &quot;kill&quot; anything or &quot;unlock&quot; anything. Just USE objects on other things and LOOK at things. That should do it. ENJOY!\nAlso, I had more practice in the past on Quest 3.53 so hopefully it should still work on 4.2 or whatever.\n\nFOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CONVERT THIS... copy the code and save it in Notepad, change the extension to .asl and you should be able to play it. \n\nEDIT\nOk, I had another brief minute to play through the game and sort of beta test it. I am not going to change the code as I have already pasted it. I don't think it would be fair. I will give you another couple of errors I noticed in my haste to finish the game for today's entry.\nBe aware of the right panel as you play. Certain objects and exits become available without the room description telling you so. Here are some things to be aware of. \n- In the toy room after you look at the certain objects in the room, weapons appear. When you &quot;take all&quot;, the only response it gives you is that you can't pick up the shelf or the chest or the bag. It does not tell you that you actually picked up the weapons. Double check your inventory afterwards by typing &quot;i&quot; or &quot;inventory&quot;\n- In Christmas Kevin's room, there is a southern exit that is not mentioned. There is a keyhole that must be dealt with to continue south. \n- In Hanukkah Hank's room after you defeat him, the description ends with &quot;press any key&quot; but nothing else happens. But in fact, the EAST door becomes available. Just go east after you beat him.\n\nI will give a simple tutorial soon after you have a chance to play it. There are fun extras in the first 3 or 4 rooms of the game so look at everything and use every object on every other object.[/quote:2nif2qhy]",

ENJOY!<br/>Also, I had more practice in the past on Quest 3.53 so hopefully it should still work on 4.2 or whatever.<br/><br/>FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CONVERT THIS... copy the code and save it in Notepad, change the extension to .asl and you should be able to play it. <br/><br/>EDIT<br/>Ok, I had another brief minute to play through the game and sort of beta test it. I am not going to change the code as I have already pasted it. I don't think it would be fair. I will give you another couple of errors I noticed in my haste to finish the game for today's entry.<br/>Be aware of the right panel as you play. Certain objects and exits become available without the room description telling you so. Here are some things to be aware of. <br/>- In the toy room after you look at the certain objects in the room, weapons appear. When you &quot;take all&quot;, the only response it gives you is that you can't pick up the shelf or the chest or the bag. It does not tell you that you actually picked up the weapons. Double check your inventory afterwards by typing &quot;i&quot; or &quot;inventory&quot;<br/>- In Christmas Kevin's room, there is a southern exit that is not mentioned. There is a keyhole that must be dealt with to continue south. <br/>- In Hanukkah Hank's room after you defeat him, the description ends with &quot;press any key&quot; but nothing else happens. But in fact, the EAST door becomes available. Just go east after you beat him.<br/><br/>I will give a simple tutorial soon after you have a chance to play it. There are fun extras in the first 3 or 4 rooms of the game so look at everything and use every object on every other object.</blockquote><div><a href=\"/attachment/2\">ChristmaKwanzakkah.asl</a></div>",
