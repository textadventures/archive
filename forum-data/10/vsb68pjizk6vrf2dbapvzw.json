Then all you need to do is complete the game and when it's done take \"Demo\" out of the name and publish it as an update and everything should work out perfectly\r\n\r\n<b>FYI:</b> The description isn't changeable after publishing as it only shows up in the listing, which doesn't change after the initial publishing of your game",
