You can loop a sound. So you can be in the lobby and play a sound on loop then move to the lounge and play a different sound on loop etc. sound can mean music or whatever.\n\nIf you want to play an entire soundtrack from start to finish regardless of the game state then that's a different question. You would need to create one entire file of the whole soundtrack and play that. Unfortunately I think Quest has file size limits but that should only really apply to the online not offline version. \n\nYou're going to have to be more specific in your question as I'm still unsure of what you actually want.",
