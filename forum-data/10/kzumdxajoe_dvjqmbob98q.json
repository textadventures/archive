Doing so generated some interesting results. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I'm working on a \"start\" screen with a series of clickable boxes \"Options\", \"Load Game\", \"Start\" and have a CSS file to plug into the program with the style that I am trying to achieve. However, I am an absolute noob when it comes to working with Java Script or jQuery but have been willing to take more of an effort to learn these things with proper guidance and instruction. I'm totally stumped after running into this problem and have searched the forums to find something useful, but it seems a little beyond my current skill. Any advice or direction is greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you.  ",
