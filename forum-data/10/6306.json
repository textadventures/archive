      "EditableText": "Certainly reiterating what Pixie said in the previous post.  I think the easiest way is to create a &quot;table of contents&quot; and allow the player to select where they want to go in the book.\n\nThe other way, if you want the player to turn the pages of the book, is to create a changing integer attribute on the book that can increase by one with a &quot;turn page&quot; command or a &quot;read page&quot;/&quot;read book&quot; command.  You could even incorporate a &quot;turn to page (x)&quot; command to turn directly to a specific page.  This is more difficult to create.\n\nI guess it depends on how important it is for the book/magazine to have certain qualities.  But, the simpler the better, I think.  The less annoying the better.  The less 'unimportant' text the better.\n\nAnyway, there are certain advantages and disadvantages to each method I can think of, but I would be willing to help regardless of the path you choose.  Just give us a little more information to go on and we can help more specifically.  Good luck.",
