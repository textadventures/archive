      "EditableText": "Well, I believe in order to move an object you need to specify the room. So, in order to do this you would likely need to query the list of exits in the room, then find the correct exit and assign the adjoining room to a variable, and then move the object to that variable. This would all be called from a custom command. Right off the top of my head I can't think of the right syntax for the code for this, and I'm just heading out right now so I don't have time to look. Hopefully this points you in the right direction.\n\nI'll take a look at it later when I have more time if someone else hasn't taken a crack at it by then.",
