The tab is also now named “undefined.” I have searched for and found a few similar Quest forum posts like mine, but none of them had a satisfactory reply to them. If anyone can tell me what exactly happened (if DevMode is broken or anything), or if there is a way I could be able to edit my game again (I can’t use the offline editor because unfortunately I don’t own a working device that can run Quest online), I would appreciate if you could tell me. Or if I will permanently be unable to edit my game online, I’m willing to accept that, I just want to see if there is any way I can undo what happened to my game first.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It’s okay I got it back by somehow getting my old Windows computer to work",
