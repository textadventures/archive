      "EditableText": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have what I think ought to be a simple problem - but if at all possible I'll need a simply-described solution, as I have zero idea how coding works. I'm just using the basic Gamebook version of Quest.\r\n\r\nSo here's what's goin on -\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my game the player can choose between two characters - a woman who carries a bazooka and a man who carries a machete. I have flags in place at this point to record which character you are and what weapon you have. Soon afterwards, they're attacked by a dinosaur. I know how to use the 'if' function so the game knows which flags have already been activated or which pages have already been seen, and I can use this to show the appropriate text. But how do I get ONLY the appropriate 'option' to show? As in, if you're carrying the machete and not the bazooka, how do I get the game to only display the option to fight using the machete and hide the option to fight with the bazooka? I can't find any way to control this.\r\n\r\nAnyway, all thoughts appreciated, but I'll need REAL simple, push-this-button-next kinda instructions.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
