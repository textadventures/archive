For instance, it is somewhat strange when having villagers that are supposed to be in a village wandering through mountains inhabited by monsters.\r\n\r\nI have used the [tutorial for Independent NPCs](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/independent_npcs.html) and I have edited the NpcSearch function so that it is now:\r\n```create timer (\"new\")\r\nexit = PickOneUnlockedExit (npc.parent)\r\nif (GetBoolean(exit, \"barred\")) {\r\n  loop = true\r\n  while (loop) {\r\n    exit = PickOneUnlockedExit(npc.parent)\r\n    if (not GetBoolean(exit, \"barred\")) {\r\n      loop = false\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\noldroom = npc.parent\r\nNpcMove (npc, exit.to)\r\nreturn (obj.parent = npc.parent)\r\n```\r\nThe problem that I have is that the game is very slow (I believe this is because of the while loop). Is there a better way to do this?\r\n\r\nI have named the exits that I want to be unusable and I also have set a flag on them 'barred'. Also, I use the online editor of quest.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n    ",
