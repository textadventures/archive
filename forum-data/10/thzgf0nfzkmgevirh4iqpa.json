      "EditableText": "If you give those rooms an attribute to identify them, you can check that. Say you gave all those rooms an attribute named \"densewoods\" with the value `true`, then you could do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (GetBoolean (game.pov.parent, \"densewoods\")) {\r\n  // your code\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can check if `game.pov.parent` (the current room) is in a list. The easiest way is probably by getting its name, so that you can check if it's in a stringlist. Like this:\r\n```\r\nif (ListContains (Split(\"Dense Woods 1;Dense Woods 2;Dense Woods 3;Dense Woods 4;Dense Woods 5;Dense Woods 6\"), game.pov.parent.name)) {\r\n  // your code\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat method is nice because it lets you check against any list of room names.\r\n\r\nBut if they all start with the same text, you could do:\r\n```\r\nif (StartsWith (game.pov.parent.name, \"Dense Woods \")) {\r\n  // your code\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
