However, whenever I try to set game.inituserinterface to the JavaScript that makes a custom status pane, an internal error occurs again. I could make it so there’s a command to check the player’s status (show health, weapon equipped, ect), but it would be much better if it could show all the time in a custom pane.\r\n\r\nIs there any way at all to set a custom status pane on the WebEditor, or do I HAVE to use the desktop version?",
