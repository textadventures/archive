As for the rest of the questions I'll see what I can do.\n\nSo first off, what do you mean specifically by &quot;menu&quot;? Do you want it as a popup or would simply creating a text page that acts as a menu be acceptable for your purposes? The built in menu system should work acceptably for what you want if your okay with how it displays, but as you said I suspect it doesn't work with the gamebook mode.\n\nFor the full text display type menu things are a bit more complicated since looping input sequences aren't anywhere near straightforwards. That being said if you understand the concept of 'functions' and think you can keep track of things while calling multiple functions across one script it's not too bad once you get how it all works together.\n\n\nAs for the while loop, is your variable being updated at all during the loop? ie: can the variable change during the loop so that it can end once it starts looping. or is the loop never triggering? I'll need a bit more detail, preferably the block of code itself with some context of whats supposed to be happening and such.",
