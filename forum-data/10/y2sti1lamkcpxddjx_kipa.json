      "EditableText": "Thanks for the quick reply! I have tried to make an enter verb to the door, but it says \"verb would clash with command: 'enter'\" and i don't remember putting an enter command anywhere. Well, I came up with somewhat of a solution. It's a little sloppy, but it works.  I created a new command with pattern \"create yellow door\" with a script that moves the player object to the corresponding room. I add a different command for each door, and i feel like it works, and i guess that's all that matters haha.",
