Until now, I've had little trouble getting used to it, but I've run into an issue I can't seem to figure out on my own. Hopefully, you smart forum people can help me out <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nHere's my problem -\n\nIn quest 4, you used to be able to set up a command containing multiple string variables. For example, I had a game with a command which read:\n\nadd #number# points to #skill#\n\nIf the player typed &quot;add 7 points to alchemy skill&quot;, the script would run a case conditional (now called a switch script in quest 5) of which one case read if #skill# equalled &quot;alchemy skill&quot;, then the numeric status variable %alchemy skill% would be incremented by the numeric status variable %amount% ( every time the string variable #number# was changed, another case conditional script would run whereby if #number# equalled &quot;7&quot; (or any other interger in between 1 and 10), then the numeric status variable %amount% would be set to 7. If #number# was changed to 8, %amount% would be set to 8. If #number# was changed to 9, %amount% would be set to 9. Get it?) Anyway, I've been trying to recreate this command in quest 5, but when I made the command &quot;add #number# to #skill#&quot;, the game was unable to recognize the variables #number# or #skill#. As a test, I added a command which returned the variable #skill#. I realized that when the player entered the command, the game wouldn't enter the typed-in text as the value of the string variables.\n\nSince this realization, I've been trying to work around it, but it's been proving difficult. I looked up the tutorial to see how to set up new variables in the game, but all I found out was that the string variables #object# and #text# can still be used in a command the same way they could be used in quest 4. I tried making the command &quot; add #text# to #object# &quot; , but this would have required me to make the player's skills actual objects and I didn't want to do that 'cause I'm sure there's a much simpler solution.\n\nThis brings me to my question: How do I set up a command with multiple string variables like the one I made in quest 4 which works basically the same way I described it working? How do I make the quest 4 command &quot;add #number# points to #skill#&quot; in quest 5?\n\nI'm sure there's some way to do this, I just haven't been able to figure out how. O generous online community, will you please help me?\n\n-Wolfberry",
