I've had to borrow a Win7 laptop from a friend for the day to run VB Studio express 2012 and I'm running out of time to get the compiler built. I had a steep learning curve this morning getting referenced libraries added and cleaning the project and am now down to one error on a build and I'm stuck.\n\nFrom what I can understand, the build doesn't know what the main class is. I assume the main class is/should be in Compiler.cs. By manually adding 'a' main class I can compile the exe, but it doesn't run. I know I'm missing some fundamental concept but time's running out to dig into it.\n\nAny help/advice/**shared .exe**  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> would be very much appreciated!\n\nPaul.",
