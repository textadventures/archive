In my game, I have a door that is locked and I'm trying to make it so that in order for the door to open, the player has to knock on the door three separate times. Ideally, the first two times would garner two different responses, while the third knock would result in the door being opened. Is something like this possible? Is there even a way for the game to keep track of how many times the player has interacted with an object?",

      "EditableText": "Well... Here are my two cents worth.  Someone will tell you after I post this to create something more 'code friendly' than what I suggest, but here I am explaining things like a noob coder.\n\nSo... Here's what I would do and I have done it before with my two other games.  I'd create three doors and keep two of them in a room that cannot be accessed during the game (I have a room that I call 'Item Warehouse' where I store all my miscellaneous stuff that I want to move in and out of rooms).  So, three identical doors - two in 'item warehouse' and one in your current room.  When you knock on door one, run a script that prints your desired message and also move that door to your 'item warehouse' AND move door number two to your current room (use move object option and move object to current room option).  Make sure you name it the same thing as the original door in the 'Alias' box.  Repeat.  Knock on door.  Print desired message.  Move door two to 'item warehouse' and move door 3 to current room.  Then, when you knock on the third door, print desired message, unlock the exit, and open the door to your next room.  \n\nHope this helps.  If you have questions about this method or anything else, let me know here or PM me.  \n\nHappy Gaming!",
