How do I make multiple clones in a room become stacked? (Ex: \"you see a rock, a rock, a rock\" = \"you see rocks [3]\")\r\n\r\n2. Instead of having stacked objects in the player's inventory, I plan to have one stone with a quantity attribute (ex: Stone.amount = 3) which is invisible when 0, and rises by +1 when a stone is picked up. When a player crafts a hatchet which requires one stone, \"Stone.amount = Stone.amount - 1\". The question is how do I tell Quest that only the stone clone in the player's inventory has this attribute? Also how to I refer to it when telling Quest to subtract from it?",
