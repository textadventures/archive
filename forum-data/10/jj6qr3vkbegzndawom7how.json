(ex. between brackets <> font color:\"#FFFFFF\") I also tried to use it several times on the same page to make text on the page multicoloured. I want to make a gamebook where all the characters' text is colour-coded and everybody has a specific hex code for their text, and a multicoloured header on each page. This is my first experience with coding and I thought this would be a lot easier. Is there an easy way for me to make text on the same line different colours?",

You can use codes like `#AAEE77` in place of a colour name.\r\nIn the CSS version, you can also use colour functions, such as `rgb(80, 80, 20)`, or `rgba(80, 80, 20, 40)` if you want a transparent colour. You also have the option of `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb`, or `lch` colours in the same way, if you know how they work.",
