      "EditableText": "Quest might well be the most popular IF system around right now, but when the majority of games it produces are of very poor quality, its worth is debatable. \n\nToday, I downloaded three at random just to see if Quest game writing had improved at all since I last looked at it several years ago. I can't say I was impressed with any of them. \n\n&quot;Doctor Incognitus &amp; The Scorpion's Sting&quot; didn’t have any major bugs that I could see, but it was a fairly average game at best with nothing much I could find to recommend to anyone. &quot;The House of Dom Orre&quot; had lots of locations that were nothing more than a line or two long, most items couldn’t be examined and the whole thing was just very, very shallow. Then I came to &quot;A Pirate's Quest for Treasure&quot; which is currently the highest rated Quest game on the site. Unfortunately, highest rated in this case doesn’t equate to good. Did I really count three typos in the introductory paragraph? That doesn’t really bode well for the rest of the game. Venturing a little further, I found a crate that didn’t have a description and couldn’t be taken (with no explanation offered for why). Moving around the ship was a pain because sometimes compass directions are adequate, yet other times I need to 'go {location}'. All in all, I didn’t find much to make me want to play it any further.\n\nSo yes, there are a lot of games being written with Quest right now, but how many of those games are worth playing? Until such time as Quest can produce the kind of games that are being written with TADS and Inform, I don’t see its popularity appealing to anyone who actually knows how to write a game.",

      "HTML": "Quest might well be the most popular IF system around right now, but when the majority of games it produces are of very poor quality, its worth is debatable. <br/><br/>Today, I downloaded three at random just to see if Quest game writing had improved at all since I last looked at it several years ago. I can't say I was impressed with any of them. <br/><br/>&quot;Doctor Incognitus &amp; The Scorpion's Sting&quot; didn’t have any major bugs that I could see, but it was a fairly average game at best with nothing much I could find to recommend to anyone. &quot;The House of Dom Orre&quot; had lots of locations that were nothing more than a line or two long, most items couldn’t be examined and the whole thing was just very, very shallow. Then I came to &quot;A Pirate's Quest for Treasure&quot; which is currently the highest rated Quest game on the site. Unfortunately, highest rated in this case doesn’t equate to good. Did I really count three typos in the introductory paragraph? That doesn’t really bode well for the rest of the game. Venturing a little further, I found a crate that didn’t have a description and couldn’t be taken (with no explanation offered for why). Moving around the ship was a pain because sometimes compass directions are adequate, yet other times I need to 'go {location}'. All in all, I didn’t find much to make me want to play it any further.<br/><br/>So yes, there are a lot of games being written with Quest right now, but how many of those games are worth playing? Until such time as Quest can produce the kind of games that are being written with TADS and Inform, I don’t see its popularity appealing to anyone who actually knows how to write a game.",

And you know why they're dire? Because the kind of standards that are pretty much an unspoken rule in other systems don't exist here. People can write a terrible Quest game and other people will tell them it's great, even while knowing it's anything but. Games are badly designed, badly written and just bad full stop, yet does anyone actually bother pointing this out? No, they pretend said games are actually decent, so the bad games just keep on coming.

I came to this forum to try to help Alex out a bit with suggestions, libraries, and even some code patches as I gain more understanding of Quest's inner workings.\n\nThird, I read reviews for several games (both good and bad) and I have not seen only praise as you claim. Reviews are pretty honest if you ask me.\n\nFourth, writing bad reviews can only serve to drive people away instead of encouraging them to stick with Quest, tinker more, and learn.\n\nFinally, and I am sure you are aware of that -- Quest enables total noobs to try making a game. It is a teaching aid and it is free. If a person who makes their first crappy game learns something out of that, and if those playing their game also learn to express what they like and what they don't without saying &quot;ur game sucks&quot; it is a net positive.\n\n[quote=&quot;davidw&quot;:38flvnx8]Are you saying we should pretend bad games are great so long as they're free?[/quote:38flvnx8]\n\nAll I am saying that you should cut them some slack or perhaps try conveying your opinion in a more pleasant manner if you can.\n\n[quote=&quot;davidw&quot;:38flvnx8]And there my opinion of you, which was never very high to begin with, sinks to an all time low.[/quote:38flvnx8]\n\nYour opinion about myself doesn't really matter to me, but maybe you could try criticizing my code, be it x86 assembler, C/C++, or Quest.\n\n[quote=&quot;davidw&quot;:38flvnx8]You're going to criticise a game you haven't even played simply because you've had a disagreement with the author? That's pathetic on so many levels I wouldn't even know where to start.[/quote:38flvnx8]\n\nNot because of disagreement, just to show how some of your own work isn't really that much better than what you criticize.\n\n[quote=&quot;davidw&quot;:38flvnx8]Maybe - for example, if you'd actually bothered to play the game you're criticising, or read the same page on IfWiki you got that information off - you'd have realised the game in question was one I wrote for a speed-comp, specifically a one hour comp, i.e. you need to write, test and fully complete your game in an hour tops. With such tight time constraints, you don't really have a week or two to come up with a fully detailed plot or ideal game world.[/quote:38flvnx8]\n\nExcuses, excuses...\n\nI give you one thing -- you slapped together a functional game in one hour. It probably helped you were familiar with the system you were writing the game in after so many games, but is still an impressive skill.\n\nUnfortunately...\n\n[quote=&quot;davidw&quot;:38flvnx8]But, of course, you didn't play the game, so you wouldn't know that.[/quote:38flvnx8]\n\nI do not have to play it to realize that it has a crappy, boring story and non-existent characters -- your own synopsis told me that.\n\nI really don't want to argue further because we have hijacked the thread enough already, I had to confront you because in your tone I felt a resentful note towards Quest and what it brings to the scene.
