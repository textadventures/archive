Ok, I think I do this by choosing Game/status Variables. ??)\r\n(??

What part of the program do I do this in:<br/><br/>4) So after you've incremented it, you need to check (a conditional statement... 'if') whether the number above, has gone over the number of channels. <br/>If it has, then set the number to 1 again - so you continually rotate. <br/>If not, then that's fine. <br/>&gt;&gt; ?? Don't understand this part at all, why would it go over and why would I have to set it back to 1 again, wouldn't that just show the same channel over and over again ... and &quot;if not thats fine&quot; would i bother with it anyway ... confused:<br/><br/><br/>5) The following expects an array of channels in the start script; <br/>This is not real code - but might be nicer to see/read <br/>the names are correct though: &lt; name | value &gt; <br/>&lt; channel[1] | channel 1! &gt; <br/>&lt; channel[2] | the weather &gt; <br/>&lt; channel[3] | woop &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt; ?? I can make the Case show below by typing it in, but I dont thein its right on my end.<br/><br/><br/>So in the &quot;change channel&quot; verb (how you do that is really up to you), you need to: <br/>&gt;&gt; ?? Sorry, Which Verb?, ... under the &quot;TV Edit&quot; or the &quot;Custom edit&quot; above the the Commnads on the left panel. Or Do I make this a command to execute the verb.<br/><br/>add one to the number variable, <br/>check to see if it's over the limit <br/>+ and if so then change it back to 1 <br/>print the message &quot;you change the channel to %number%. You see #channel[number]#&quot; <br/><br/>Whenever you look at the TV you need to print something like: <br/>&quot;you see #channel[number]#&quot; <br/><br/>&gt;&gt; ?? that will probably be apparent when I get the above working correctly.<br/><br/>Also:<br/>sometimes certain parts asks me for a name, do I use: Channel, Change Channel, #object#, #Channel# ... do i use the same name each time ...confused.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Side Note:<br/>I checked the Help contents on Arrays, it is helpful in its explanation except it does not show you how to make one (ie: open advanced/conditional/select user has object ... so it gives no clue on how to/or where to use/start, it only shows how it works and obviously the code example it supplies has to go in one of 75 places, but which one).<br/><br/>I think I could understand you all more if you also told me where to at least start/go to write the coding you suggest. <br/>...... an example of what i'm asking is #2 above:<br/><br/>[[[[[[[[Under Verb/edit script/Conditional/If]]]]]]]<br/>1) You create an array (a list) of 'channel' variables (channel[1], channel[2], channel[3]).. These are the descriptions for each of the channels (You see a western, you see the news, etc). <br/><br/>in the example above, that at least tells me to try the verbs/conditional &quot;places&quot; rather than all 75 (x's 5 or 6 code tries) options ...lol!<br/><br/>I know the above isn't correct, just an idea of, where to go, to do, as you say ???<br/><br/>Thanks folks !!!",
