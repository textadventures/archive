Lightwriter and others are doing things I couldn't imagine making work but I learn a bit with each of these questions.  Just an FYI... and it's awesome that the people here are as knowledgable and helpful as they are.  Thanks!\nNot that my input here is anyway helpful, but, I would have (and thankfully I'm not) tried setting a &quot;day&quot; = x number of turns and then flagged each day (set flag day 1, day 2, day 3, etc) followed by an 'if/then' script that restocks.  Ugly for sure!!  Lol\n\nGood luck Lightwriter!",
