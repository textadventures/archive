      "EditableText": "So click on the object in your editor. You should see a screen with several tabs at the top. Setup, Object, Inventory, Verbs, Features, Attributes, Objects.\r\n\r\nGo to Attributes. You'll see two windows; Inherited Types and Attributes. Go to Attributes, and click the 'Add' button. This will give you a new Attribute.\r\n\r\nAttributes are just that. Something about the object in question. They can be simple presets like 'do we call this thing he, she, or it?' or they can be something wacky like 'HasBeenCrushed'.\r\n\r\nThe way I would do what you do is this: Add. Call the attribute TattooLocation. Then I'd go to the new Attribute - it's in the little box you're looking at - and keep its type as String.\r\n\r\nI don't know how you want to move it around, but lets create a new object and call it TattooMoveCheater. For it, I create the verb 'Move Tattoo'.\r\n\r\nFrom here you can get fancy, but I'll do the simple version. Move Tattoo runs a script. The script is simple: \"Set an Object's Attribute (named by an expression)\". I'd tell it to set the object Tattoo's TattooLocation to... I don't know. \"Head\". Head in quotation marks, since it's a string.\r\n\r\nSo now the Tattoo's attribute says it's on your head. But how do you tell that? Well let's have another Set Object Attribute in the script. But this one set's Tattoo's alias. We can rename what we see it as. Let's have this button rename it \"Head Tattoo\".\r\n\r\nBut what if we want to Look At the tattoo? {if Tattoo.TattooLocation=Head:This tattoo is on your head.}  (Note, no quotations around the String here. I know, weird, right?)\r\n\r\n{if Tattoo.TattooLocation=Chest:This tattoo is on your chest.}\r\n\r\nAnd etc. etc. Hope that clears it up? I feel I was pretty wordy.",
