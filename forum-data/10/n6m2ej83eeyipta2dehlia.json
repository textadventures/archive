      "EditableText": "I feel like an idiot, but I was having trouble making a safe with a password for the player to type in (I could have used a piece of paper with the code as a \"key\" using the basic container function, but didn't want to resort to that). I thought I'd check the forums and found nothing, so since I've solved the issue, I thought I'd create this post for anyone else struggling.\r\n\r\nFirst, you need two objects: The safe (complete with whatever item/s you wish to hide in it) and a keypad.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Go to the features tab of the safe, then select container.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Go to the container tab, select closed container, then set it as lockable, with no keys.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Go to the keypad object, go to features and set it as use/give.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Go to the use/give tab and set it to run a script when used on its own.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Print the message \"Please enter the password:\", or something to that effect.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Run the script \"Get input\".\r\n\r\nStep 7: Add an \"If\" script to that and select expression.\r\n\r\nStep 8: If your password is 1111, the expression will look like this: result=\"1111\"\r\nIf your password is password, the expression should be: result=\"password\"\r\n\r\nStep 9: Print a message. Something like \"correct. The safe unlocks\", or something like that.\r\n\r\nStep 10: This is the bit I missed and made me feel like an idiot. I chose \"open object\". You don't want to do this. It will open the object, but it won't let you take the items or open/close the safe. Instead, run the script \"set variable\". The variable is safe.locked (if your safe is named \"safe\", anyway.)\r\n\r\nStep 11: Expression should already be selected from the dropdown box, but if not, select that. In the final box, type \"false\".\r\n\r\nStep 12: For the else, just print a message like \"It doesn't open\".\r\n\r\nThe safe should now work. That's how I made mine :)",
