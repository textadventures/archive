      "EditableText": "I don't think I was clear enough. I want to simply change the default text that returns when the player types &quot;open door&quot;, which as it stands, will come back as &quot;It is locked,&quot; but that messes with how I want the puzzle to go. I know the door doesn't unlock and open normally, like with a key, and I want it that way.\n\nHere's the puzzle, if you didn't already try it. When you light the candle in the first room, you illuminate the wardrobe, which allows you to find both a key and a bowl of cheese. Using the key on the door does nothing, and I have it set up so that it tells the player that the door is already unlocked, but it won't budge. The actual solution to the puzzle is that the player must melt the bowl of cheese using the candle, and then use the melted fondue as a lubricant agent to force the door open. I recognize cheese may not act this way, and I might change it to something else, but as of now that's how I want the puzzle to go.",
