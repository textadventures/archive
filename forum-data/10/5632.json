Go to the &quot;key object&quot; and search for the &quot;features tab&quot; on it --- then click on the tab. \n\n6. Check &quot;Use/Give&quot; What that does is allow your key to be used on your desired object much easier and much more precisely. \n\n7. After you've clicked on &quot;Use/Give&quot; ...go to the &quot;Use/Give tab&quot;\n\n8. You'll see a list now, &quot;Use (on it's own)&quot;, &quot;Use (other object) on this&quot;, &quot;Use this on (other object)&quot; and so on. We want to use the first one, &quot;Use (on it's own)&quot; \n\n 9. Click on the &quot;Action &quot;[i:22gc9co0]None[/i:22gc9co0]&quot;&quot; box directly below &quot;Use (on it's own)&quot;\n\n 10. Search the list and find, &quot;Run Script&quot; \n\n11. Make an &quot;If&quot; script. \n\n12. On the &quot;If Script&quot; select, &quot;player not in room&quot;\n\n13. Keep it an &quot;object&quot; and then select &quot;your room name&quot;\n\n14. After that find, &quot;then&quot; on that script, select &quot;Add New Script&quot; --- find &quot;Print a message&quot; (very first selection I think at the very top). \n\n15. Type something like, &quot;You can't use this here...&quot; What this does is...if the player is NOT in the correct room with the key it won't show or open. Another words the key cannot be &quot;used&quot; yet.\n\n16. Click on &quot;Add Else If&quot;, &quot;Add New Script&quot; and find &quot;Make Exit Visible&quot; click it and then select your room. \n\n17. Next &quot;Add New Script&quot; to that &quot;Else If&quot; (don't make a new &quot;else if script&quot;) and add &quot;unlock exit&quot; and click on your &quot;lock name&quot; from the list. \n\n18. Now if you want the key to be dropped after the door is visible and unlock click &quot;Add new script&quot;, &quot;remove object&quot; and select your key. \n\nNow when the player enters that room, they shouldn't see that exit. When they obtain the key however, it'll make the exit visible and when the key is used in the autogenerated verb list it'll unlock the door and discard the key.\n\nLet me know if this works!
