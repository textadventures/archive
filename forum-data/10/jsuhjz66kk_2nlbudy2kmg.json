Off the top of my head, you could do something like this:\r\n```\r\nJS.eval (\"$(function () {var r = window.addText; window.addText = function(){}; window.resumeText = function() {window.addText = r;}});\")\r\nundo\r\nJS.resumeText ()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe (rather awkward) eval line basically removes the javascript function `addText`, which is used for all Quest functions which display text to the screen. This prevents any text being output at all until the corresponding `JS.resumeText()` is reached.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could do it the same way menus are handled:\r\n```\r\nsection = StartNewOutputSection()\r\nundo\r\nEndOutputSection (section)\r\nHideOutputSection (section)\r\n```\r\nthis looks a bit simpler; it just starts a new output section, and then hides that section using the same code that is used to hide menu options after one has been selected.",
