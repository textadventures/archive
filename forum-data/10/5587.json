      "EditableText": "So, I have about 4 rooms next to each other that are labeled 'beach' and I want it so that whenever you are in any of those rooms, a track that I imported of beach sounds plays.  I just don't want it so that every time I go to any of these rooms the sound has to repeat from scratch.  So let's say I have room A1, A2, A3 and A4.  If I go into A1 for example, it will trigger the music.  That's easy.  I then want to go from A1 to A2 and have the same track looping so it doesn't start again.    How do I do this?  I'm asking because I have another set of rooms (B1 to B4) that are next to these, that have another type of track, and I want it so that whenever you are in these rooms you get an ambiance sound.\n\nWould appreciate any help!!",

I want to set it up so that the music always starts in rooms A1-A4, and it's not interrupted unless they move into any room from B1-B4, in which the same thing would happen there but with other music.  I'll keep looking as well and post here if I find anything.\n\nCheers!",
