Maybe I'm using a later version, but I want to do the same. I understand that I first have to set up my variable and then I have to add an integer, but what I can't work out from that thread is how I set it up in the first place. \r\n\r\nAssuming I am in script+text mode and I want to create a counter called 'diplomacy', I do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Click 'Add New Script'\r\n2. Under Variables I select 'Set a variable or attribute'\r\n3. Click 'Add'\r\n4. In the 'Set variable' box I type 'player.diplomacy'\r\n5. It then says '= expression' (expression is in a drop-down but it's the only option)\r\n6. This is the bit I don't understand. Do I add in the second box 'player.diplomacy' again?\r\n\r\nIn the code version of the page I have:\r\n\r\n     <script type=\"script\">\r\n      player.diplomacy = player.diplomacy\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\n...which doesn't make sense. \r\n\r\nAfter that, what do I do? How do I add a value of 10 to player.diplomacy on the first page? Am I adding a second script? Is it a counter? \r\n\r\nHow do I then subtract a value of 5 from player.diplomacy on page 4, for example?\r\n\r\nAnd then how do I display the player.diplomacy value on a page?",
