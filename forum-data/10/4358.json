      "EditableText": "There seems to be a bug in the gamebook code where it *really* wants an options dictionary on a page. The problem is that until you create a link option, that dictionary doesn't exist.\n\nThe solution is to create an empty options dictionary on the pages that have only inline links. There are two ways to do it:\n\n1) The code view way. Switch to Code View, and for each page that has no links, add this line on that page:\n\n[code:3j5dmvjl]&lt;options type=&quot;stringdictionary&quot; /&gt;[/code:3j5dmvjl]\n2) The GUI way. On a page that will have no links, still create a link and then delete it. For example, click &quot;Link to Existing Page&quot;, pick some random page and then enter random text for the link. Then click the new link and delete it. That will leave an empty options dictionary on the page. It looks like you were sort of working that out yourself with your random looking &quot;esfr&quot; link on the &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; page. Just delete that link now, and it will still keep working for that page.\n\nHope that helps!",
