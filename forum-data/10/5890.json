Here's my coding dilemma. \n\nI have a &quot;wait&quot; about half-way through the text ((just to break it up a little))...and at the very end of the text, I have a &quot;get input&quot; question giving the player a choice on how they would like to respond. Is there anyway, to &quot;pause&quot; the scripting, or anything after the &quot;wait&quot; command is executed that has been discovered. Like for example...\n\nBlah blah blah text\n\nWait\n\n((Magic feat of coding))\n\nGet Input. \n\nIf not, that's a bummer.",
