      "EditableText": "Hi there. Is there anyway to duplicate a whole game? There is no option to do this on the website. I am using the online tool only. I've read that you can copy from the full code view into a new game, but I have just discovered that you cannot access the full code view in the online tool. I don't have a Windows PC so I can't download the desktop version. Please, please can anyone help. I desperately need to duplicate the game, as I am making two versions and an extremely large part is the same in both. I could never remake the whole lot over again.\r\n\r\nThanks very much.",
