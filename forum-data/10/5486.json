I saw one thread with multiple keypads and cabinets but I believe that was for the desktop version.\n\nI am using a container with a keypad. The container is locked. What I want is once the keycode (lets say 1111)  is entered the container unlocks and opens and the player can then enter the container. Do I treat the container as a room?  \nI am having trouble getting this to work on the web version.  I made two objects, the container and the keypad but i cant seem to link them correctly. \n\nAny help would be appreciated or a link to where this might already be explained?\n\nThank you all in advance",
