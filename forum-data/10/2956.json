How do I edit using another script?\n-&gt;Well, I know I can edit attiributes using 'Set a variable or attiribute'. I know I can edit a script too with that, but it needs a little bit of Programming language understandiblity. Is there an easier way you can edit attiribute script easily?\n\nAnd the ideas...\n\n1.An option for the objects:Make a tickbox which says 'Make this the normal character'.\n-&gt;By default, for the player, it will be ticked, but for any other object it will be unticked.Of course this will have an attiribute, which will make it easy to switch between characters, a problem that has been harassing Quest makers for a long time.\nThere cannot be less than one object ticked, too.\n\n2.An edit in the 'If' script.\n-&gt;There is an 'If' script called 'If object attiribute equals to'. In that, make 'equals to' a dropdown box which can be turned into 'greater than' or 'lesser than'. I know this is accesiible using 'If expression', but I think my idea is easier.\n\n3.Save Game...\n-&gt;...for the offline version. There can be a script called 'Save the game' and 'Load a game file'. Also, by default, there can be a turn script which saves the game every turn. \nI used to make graphic games using a software 'Game Maker'. GM could load and save games, so it can be possible for Quest too!\n\n4.Masks\n-&gt;If you're thinking 'Oh, a player can wear this,( <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> ) then read on. A mask is an option in an object. They can choose another object(object2) as a mask. If object2 is the mask of object1, then object1 will have all the same attiributes and values of object2.\n\n5.Worn Items(It's not that good) <!-- s:( --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /><!-- s:( --> \n-&gt;Worn Items is a window pane on the right side along with Inventory, Compass etc. An object will also have a 'Wearable' option, which will create a verb, and worn items come in the window pane.",
