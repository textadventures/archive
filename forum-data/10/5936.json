I want to create a time interval between msg elements or between pages but I can't figure out how to do this.  I am using Quest in gamebook mode and I want messages/pages to show up with a time interval, as if the user were waiting for someone to type in a message.  So something like:\n\nPage 1\n\nHello Bob.  Just wanted to say hi\n--- 5 seconds ---\nBob? are you getting this?\n{link:page 2:sure, what's up?} | {link:page 3: yawn, stop bothering me!}\n\nPage 3\n\n--- 8 seconds ---\nGeez. What's wrong with you?",
