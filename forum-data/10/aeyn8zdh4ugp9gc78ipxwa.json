This is a common use of turnscripts. If you're not good with scripting, there's already a CombatLib which might help you (though I don't have a link to it; there are quite a few questions about it on the forum which do)\r\n\r\n> 2.Upon death, return the player's avatar to the \"checkpoint\" or \"startpoint\" so players could choose to be that avatar again?\r\n\r\nYes. You can move the player wherever you want within a script.\r\n\r\n> 3.Is it possible to change what happens after death (maybe possibly using IF scripts but idk...) like so lets say you die before you get to the second checkpoint you respawn in the first one, if you die after the second checkpoint but before the third then you start from the second, etc etc?\r\n\r\nYes. You can move the player to wherever you want, and change their attributes however you want. The first step would be to work out the what you want to happen and the conditions you want it to happen under, both in unambiguous terms.\r\n\r\n> 4.Change the starting health for each avatar?\r\n\r\nKind of. If you enable the \"player health\" system on the features tab, then changing the player object will set the new player's health to 100. If you want it to be a different value, ignore that feature and create your own health attribute.\r\n\r\n> 5.Change the damage for every weapon?\r\n\r\n\"damage\" isn't a part of the Quest core. You will have to write script somewhere that causes a character's health to be reduced when they are attacked. As you're writing that script, you can determine the damage it inflicts however you want.\r\n\r\n> 6.How do you create NPC's with health?\r\n\r\nThe usual way is to give them an attribute to store their current health. Then create a script somewhere (usually some kind of \"attack\" command, or a function) which reduces an NPC's health.\r\n\r\nIf you give an NPC a script attribute named `changedhealth`, it will be automatically run whenever the value of their `health` attribute changes. This applies to any other attribute too. So you could make that script attribute check if the health has hit zero, and change whatever other attributes you use to indicate \"death\", or display a message that the enemy is dead.\r\n\r\n> 7.Does anybody know of other websites I could publish text based games on?

I moved it to the north and found it accessable. Tried moving it back but it wouldn't work. What else do you think I could do to improve Mystical? Have you tested it a few times or just once?
