      "EditableText": "Okay, lets say you have a room, and in that room, you have a large blue box with the words 'Police' across the top and a flashing light. When you enter the 'Police Box' it becomes a separate room, you can go 'out' back into the main parent room, or explore more of the 'Police Box'. Because it is a separate room, it wont get listed on the parent room, when you're inside it. You can make the box visible or invisible when viewed from the parent room, but once you're inside it, just telling the player it's invisible should be enough.",
