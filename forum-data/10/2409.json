Would it be possible to add additional boxes? It would be fine to click a container in the inventorybox and then to get a new box with the items inside. It also should be complete scriptable, for example to implement a shop, where all shopitems are displayed in a new box. The box should have the verb-bar like inventory and &quot;places and objects&quot;",
