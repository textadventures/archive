      "EditableText": "unfortunately, most use Text Adventures as it has the full programming capability, so there's little documentation of using Game Books.\r\n\r\nto do stuff with Game Books requires scripting, which is done via:\r\n\r\n'whatever' Page Object -> 'Page' Tab -> Page Type: [SCRIPT] or [SCRIPT+TEXT] -> (see below)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> (choose your script, more details below) \r\n\r\nso, use your first page to add/create all the Attributes and their initial Values, you want to be in your game, which is done via the 'set variable or attribute' Script:\r\n\r\n'YOUR_FIRST_PAGE' Page Object -> 'Page' Tab -> 'Page Type: [SCRIPT] or [SCRIPT+TEXT] -> (see below)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\nreplace my 'NAME_OF_OBJECT' with either (you ONLY have two choices in/for/with the Game Book):\r\n\r\ngame\r\n---or---\r\nplayer\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\nset variable player.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\nnext, replace my 'NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE' with whatever you want as the name of whatever the Attribute you want to create/add (quest knows the type of Attribute from the Value you give it, my 'VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION' part), for example (I like being descriptive with my names, so I add the '_integer_attribute' to it's name, but you can just do 'strength', just remember that all names must be unique, as the 'name' String Attribute is the ID for quest):\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength_integer_attribute = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\nlast, we need to give it a Value, which can be a simple Value or a complex Expression, for this example, we're going to give it a simple Value of '0' (zero), as this is it's starting/initial value, so replace my 'VALUE_OR_EXPRESISON' with '0', see below:\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength_integer_attribute = [EXPRESSION] 0\r\n\r\n(the Value of '0' is what tells quest that this is an Integer Value and thus the Attribute is an Integer Attribute)\r\n\r\n(my own personal naming system/convention of 'xxx_integer_attribute' has nothing at all to do with what type of Attribute it is, only the Value does. If we gave the Attribute the value of 'true' or 'false', then the Attribute would be a Boolean Attribute, for example: set variable game.orc_dead = [EXPRESSION] false, our simulated 'orc object' starts off not dead, it starts out alive. And when we want the orc to be dead, we'd change/re-set it's Value to being 'true', set variable game.orc_dead = [EXPRESSION] true, and there's other types of Attributes as well, such as Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries. Not sure if the Game Book supports Object reference Attributes and Objectlist Attribute or not, as you are limited to only the 'game' Game Object, 'player' Player Object, and the Page Objects)\r\n\r\nso, now when the game begins, the first page will create/add/put/give our 'strength_integer_attribute = 0' onto our 'player' Player Object\r\n\r\nwe can now use this Attribute (player.strength_integer_attribute), as much as we want, and where-ever/when-ever we want, for example, we can have a page for showing our character's stats:\r\n\r\n'YOUR_CHARACTER_STAT_SCREEN' Page Object -> 'Page' Tab -> 'Page Type: [SCRIPT] or [SCRIPT+TEXT] -> (see below)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"Strength: \" + player.strength_integer_attribute\r\n// outputs/displays (currently in this example progression):\r\n// Strength: 0\r\n\r\nnow, what about adjusting/changing our 'player.strength_integer_attribute' Integer Attribute ???\r\n\r\nwell, where/when ever you want it to happen, let's say on page 2:\r\n\r\n'YOUR_PAGE_2' Page Object -> 'Page' Tab -> 'Page Type: [SCRIPT] or [SCRIPT+TEXT] -> (see below)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [MESSAGE] You find and drink a strength potion, increasing your strength by five.\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'variable' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength_integer_attribute = [EXPRESSION] player.strength_integer_attribute + 5\r\n\r\nand now, if you were to go back to your 'YOUR_CHARACTER_STAT_SCREEN' page, it'll now show/display your new strength:\r\n\r\nStrength: 5\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nfor greater detail, here's a link (it's for Text Adventures, but the scripting itself is the same for Text Adventures and Game Book, but the location/access to the scripting is different, and the Game Book doesn't have the non-scripting 'Attribute -> Add' capability that the Text Adventure has, nor does the Game Book have unlimited and custom Objects like the Text Adventure does, of course):\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk\r\n\r\nyou can also look here:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/ifanswers/ifanswers.com/questions.html\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/ifanswers/ifanswers.com/1150/gamebook-how-to-include-a-players-attributes-stats.html\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/ifanswers/ifanswers.com/969/i-need-help-with-attributes.html\r\nand more (search through the pages of the 'ifansswers' link above)\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nas for output/display/messaging formatting, you can use 'concatenation', and maybe also the 'text processor commands', see here:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/text_processor.html\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"You have {player.strength_integer_attribute} strength.\"\r\n\r\nor, using concatenation:\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk#39951 (the 'msg' Script in coding is your 'print a message -> print [EXPRESSION]' Script in the GUI/Editor)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"You have \" + player.strength_integer_attribute + \" strength.\"\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nwith 'printing a message' Script:\r\n\r\nthe [MESSAGE] option is for just text/string only:\r\n\r\nprint [MESSAGE] Hi, my name is HK, what is your name?

Otherwise, if you know the GUI/Editor's script options choose them instead of using the [EXPRESSION] option. However, there's some things that aren't GUI/Editor Script options, and so you have to use the [EXPRESSION] option. For example, in the GUI/Editor's script options you got the 'IncreaseObjectCounter', which increases an Integer Attribute by 1, but what if you want to increase it by 5 instead? You can't unless you use the [EXPRESSION] option and code/type it in yourself (which I've shown/done in this post example of mine). What if you don't want to use addition but muliplication? you can't unless you use the [EXPRESSION] option:\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength_integer_attribute = [EXPRESSION] player.strength_integer_attribute * 3\r\n\r\nsame with the 'DecreaseObjectCounter', it ONLY subtracts by 1, so if you want to do a different value, you got to use the [EXPRESSION] option:\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength_integer_attribute = [EXPRESSION] player.strength_integer_attribute - 3\r\n\r\nand also, if you want to do division instead:\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength_integer_attribute = [EXPRESSION] player.strength_integer_attribute / 7\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIncreaseObjectCounter (player, \"strength_integer_attribute\") // I believe this is how the 'IncreaseObjectCounter' GUI/Editor Script option is/looks in code, and in the GUI/Editor, it's something like this I believe: IncreaseObjectCounter: [OBJECT] player [ATTRIBUTE/VALUE] strength_integer_attribute\r\n\r\nis the exact same thing as the GUI/Editor's scripting (using the [EXPRESSION] option):\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength_integer_attribute = [EXPRESSION] player.strength_integer_attribute + 1\r\n\r\nand also this directly in code is the exact same thing as well:\r\n\r\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = player.strength_integer_attribute + 1",
