Is there another step that I don't know about?\nThanks,\nPaul\nUPDATE: OK I see I never got to the &quot;Publish&quot; part! Well I compiled it to html but it didn't do anything much. Gave me a page that said &quot;Inventory&quot; up at the top and a narrow windo that's too small for the commands to type in. I type them and the only response is just to give me another command prompt. Look likes it needs a lot of work yet. Like they say on SNL, &quot;It just aint ready for prime time!&quot;\nPaul",
