With that I mean, I am trying to add pictures which correspond with what is happening in the environment. The problem that I am having though is that there are many things happening and I keep messing up somewhere, to the point that I am completely lost now and have no clue what the hell is happening anymore. I am also out of ideas, so please help.\n\nIts even difficult to explain, but but basically I have 5 conditions.\n\n1. You start by lying on the bed and if I you are lying on the bed, I dont want the player to be able to do anything until he gets up. A message might appear something like: &quot;You can't reach it while you are lying on the bed.&quot; The only thing that I can interact with from the bed is the alarm clock and there I want to be able to decide whether to pick it up or turn it off. If I turn it off, i want to skip point 2 and go directly to point 3. If I pick it up the clock is still ringing, but it is in my inventory.\n2. If I get up, I have the second condition. Basically the alarm clock is ringing and you cannot focus on anything until you turn it off. So, although you can now reach certain stuff, you can't really interact with it in any meaningful way, until you turn the clock off. A message like this might pop out: &quot;I can't focus!&quot;\n3. Once the clock is turned off and the player is up, I want to have full access to everything. \n4. There is also a suitcase that needs to be moved to bed and back again, but I can interact with it only after point 3 is done. All of this I already managed to achieve, but here comes the tricky part where stuff gets messy.\n5. I also have pictures involved. So, I want to be able to see the change happening when for example the clock is missing from the desk and the suitcase is lying on the bed. So, there are actually 4 pictures that have to be compatible with ShowRoomDescription based on the choices you make. Also the picture needs to change instantly as you make change to the environment:\na.)Picture of the clock ringing on the desk and the suitcase lying under the bed.\nb.) Picture of the clock ringing on the desk and the suitcase on top of the bed.\nc.) Picture of the clock missing from the desk and the suitcase lying under the bed.\nd.) Picture of clock missing from the desk and the suitcase on top of the bed.\n\nThere are only 2 descriptions for this room. One is set before you enter the room and it basically just says that you woke up. The second kicks in when I turn off the clock and you get more details about the room.\n\nNow, I don't expect anyone to code this for me. I know its hell of a job to do that, But any suggestions how to do it? I tried copying the same room a couple of times and moving the player around based on these conditions, but then I have so many items that are cloned that I cant make sense of it, and the worst part is that it doesn't work either. I usually get pictures mixed up and appearing at the wrong time in the wrong place. I tried having one room and two clocks (one that is ringing and one that is not ringing), same result. I have tried with setobject flag and if commands and the result is again the same.",

Perhaps it will help:<br/><br/><pre><code>if (GetBoolean(alarm clock, &quot;taken&quot;)) {<br/>  // Some code<br/>}<br/>else if (GetBoolean(alarm clock, &quot;taken&quot;) and GetBoolean(suitcase, &quot;moved&quot;)) {<br/>  // Some other code<br/>}<br/><br/></code></pre><br/>If the alarm clock is taken, then it will always go down the first branch. It will never get to the second. You could solve it by reversing the blocks (so the more specific check happens first). You could also break it down like this:<br/><br/><pre><code>if (GetBoolean(alarm clock, &quot;taken&quot;)) {<br/>  // taken case<br/>  if (GetBoolean(suitcase, &quot;moved&quot;)) {<br/>    // taken and moved case<br/>  } else {<br/>    // taken and not moved case<br/>  }<br/>} else {<br/>  // not taken case<br/>  if (GetBoolean(suitcase, &quot;moved&quot;)) {<br/>    // not taken and moved case<br/>  } else {<br/>    // not taken and not moved case<br/>  }<br/>}<br/></code></pre></blockquote><br/>Oh! So the trick is to have the more specific check happening first. If I understood you correctly, that means I would always have to start with an &quot;if&quot; command  that has the most checks, and then slowly narrow it down to only one check? That kind of explains what was the problem, because I did it other way around and then the command would not even get to the more specific ones.<br/><br/>But you still havent answered my question about pictures above.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks a lot Jay. That was the piece of the puzzle I was missing. With this new knowledge, I think I can avoid similar problems in the future.",
