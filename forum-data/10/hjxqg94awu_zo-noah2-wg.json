      "EditableText": "Hey everyone. I need to make an IF game for a university assignment, so I've never done this before and need some help. \r\n\r\nBasically, what I'm trying to do, is that if a player sees 4 specific pages, an option will \"unlock\" on an already established page.  One of my pages is an office with a locked door, and right now I have it set that if the player goes up there they can just go back to the foyer where they came from. But I want an option to appear for them to proceed if they saw all 4 specific pages in any order, which would give them the clue to unlock the door.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to do this through \"functions\", Script, clicking \"if\" and then clicking \"player has seen page\", but for some reason something I'm doing isn't working.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm here, I'm also trying to have this game have multiple ending. I basically want say, if you see pages 3, 5 & 7, but not 2, 4 and 6, you get ending 1. If you see pages 2, 4 and 6, but you don't see 3, 5 and 7 you get ending 2. If you see pages 2-7 you get ending 3. If you DON'T see pages 2-7, but you see pages 8, 9, 10 (the pages I want the player to need to see to just unlock the door as I mentioned already) you'll get ending 4.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense. This project is for an English class and so I don't know how to code. I thought Gamebook would be easier, and I've made all the pages I want the player to be able to access already and have been able to \"link\" them properly. But when it comes to how to do the actual endings for the game and getting the player to be able to unlock the door I'm completely lost.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
