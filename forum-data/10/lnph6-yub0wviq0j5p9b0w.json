      "EditableText": "**Introduction**\r\n\r\nAre you looking for a vacuum for all kinds of surfaces, lightweight, compact, and with good performance? The [**Shark APEX UpLight**](https://steemit.com/vacuumcleaners/@topvacuumcleaner/shark-apex-uplight-vacuum-review-with-lift-away-duoclean) is one of the perfect options for your needs.\r\n\r\nWhat factors are these credible features based on? This Shark vacuum is an excellent vacuum for use on bare floors or carpets with good suction. Besides having  high maneuverability, it is fantastic that this vacuum does not require much maintenance.\r\n\r\nNow, let's go on to see the detailed features of this device!\r\n\r\n**About the Shark APEX UpLight**\r\n\r\nThis type is a great stick vacuum in general. It comes with an excellent filtration system and is perfect for pet owners since it effortlessly vacuums fur from any surface. This vacuum is not bothered by bare floors because it can easily pick up any debris.\r\n\r\nIt is also lovely to use on the low-pile carpets even if it doesn't have power or surface type adjusting capabilities, but it struggles with little and big particles on a high-pile carpet. However, This vacuum has some parts that need to be maintained, including two brushrolls and three separate filters. But they are all very straightforward to access.\r\n\r\nYou can also use this vacuum in a portable mode, but the hose length is relatively small. Although different versions may come with various brushes, the Uplight vacuum often comes with a few useful tools, including a turbo brush, crevice tool, and stiff bristle brush. Overall, this vacuum works effectively in a variety of situations.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xkz7AbT.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Impressive Features**\r\n\r\n**1/ HEPA Filtration**\r\n\r\nThis type of equipment also has HEPA filtration in addition to the Anti-Allergen Complete Seal technology. The best filtration system available on the market is HEPA because this system can filter out 99.97 percent of particles smaller than 0.3 microns.\r\n\r\nBecause of its great efficiency, a HEPA filter can remove more than typical allergens like pollen and tiny particles. It will also protect against harmful airborne germs such as viruses and bacteria.\r\n\r\nHowever, the HEPA filter is simply one component of the vacuum's overall filtration mechanism. This package includes two ordinary filters in addition to the HEPA filter. The first is composed of foam, while the second is made of a felt-like substance. By collecting big dirt particles and debris, they aid the HEPA filter.\r\n\r\n**2/ Dust Canister**\r\n\r\nThe dustbin holds 0.68 dry quarts. That is about 0.15 gallons (0.6 liters). Although that capacity would work for most homes, those with large areas to clean may find the bin a bit too small.\r\n\r\nIf you have a lot of dirt and debris to clean, expect to make frequent trips to the trash can. But the bin is easy to empty, and you get the debris out in a minute. This makes cleaning high-traffic areas convenient despite the small bin.\r\n\r\nThe dust cup is made from transparent plastic material, and you can see the contents as you do your cleaning tasks. It allows you to tell when the bin is almost filling up so you can empty it on time.\r\n\r\n**3/ Lift-Away Pod**\r\n\r\nThe **Shark APEX Uplight vacuum** can be converted from a stick vacuum to a canister vacuum by pushing the button. It connects a suction hose to the pod, and you are good to go! The UpLight's Lift-Away pod is tiny and light enough that you can use it as a handheld vacuum if you connect a dusting brush to it, which is what we recommend.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you will have a vacuum that can do three things at once. Depending on your needs and preferences, this vacuum may be used as a canister, a stick, or a handheld vacuum. This adaptability is one of the primary reasons why the UpLight has much traction on the sales charts.\r\n\r\nWhen removed from the frame of the stick vacuum, this Lift-Away pod weighs just about five pounds when standing alone. Cleaning has become more accessible as a result of the increased mobility, so cleaning the stairwell and the ceiling is also a lot less of a headache.\r\n\r\n**4/ Self-Cleaning And DuoClean Brushrolls**\r\n\r\nHaving DuoClean brushrolls is one of the most distinguishing features of this vacuum model. Although the floorhead part of most vacuum cleaners on the market is equipped with a single brushroll, the **Shark APEX Uplight Duoclean** includes two.\r\n\r\nA stiff-bristle brushroll comes with the UpLight's floorhead to clean carpets. A soft-bristle one is conveniently located next to it for cleaning bare floors. They can work together to remove tough dirt and debris from a variety of different surfaces.\r\n\r\nBesides having two brushrolls, the floorhead features a unique \"Self-Cleaning\" design that makes cleaning easier. If you have a pet, you will appreciate those brushrolls because they will not get tangled with pet hair. Mainly, you will find it effortless to get hair clumps out of the bristles of the Shark vacuum’s brushrolls.\r\n\r\n**5/ Pros and Cons**\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n*   Works well on low-pile carpets and bare floors\r\n*   Flexible to maneuver\r\n*   Affordable price\r\n*   HEPA filter\r\n*   Lightweight design\r\n*   Picks up pet hair\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n*   Suction not adjustable\r\n*   Some parts need to be maintained\r\n*   Small dust cup\r\n\r\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\r\n\r\n**1/ Should I Buy The Shark APEX Uplight?**\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a lightweight and compact vacuum that can clean carpets, hard floors, furniture, and area rugs while also picking up pet hair, the Shark APEX Uplight Corded Lift-Away is a great choice.\r\n\r\n**2/ Is The Uplight Safe For Allergies?**\r\n\r\nThe Shark APEX Uplight Lift-Away Duoclean features a practical anti-allergen function that passed the testers' fog test, which is significant because most vacuums cannot accomplish this feat. \r\n\r\nBecause of its sealed system and HEPA filter, the Shark Uplight is entirely safe for asthma patients and allergy sufferers to use. It is one of the most affordable vacuums on the market that has a sealed HEPA filtration system.\r\n\r\n**3/ Do I Use My Uplight To Get Urine Out Of Carpet?**\r\n\r\nIndeed, a vacuum cannot get rid of urine completely. So you have to do it in some additional ways.\r\n\r\n*   Dry your carpet with a clean cloth.\r\n*   Apply detergents such as baking soda, dish detergent, or hydrogen peroxide and then scrub the urine-soaked carpet gently. \r\n*   Use your vacuum cleaner to remove any residual substances.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, if you still do not know How to get urine out of carpet thoroughly, you can call  professionals to get rid of the pet's urine.\r\n\r\n**Find More Info:** [**How to Get Urine Out of Carpet Quickly and Easily - Housecleaning Guide**](https://thekinglive.com/how-to-get-urine-out-of-carpet.html)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ee2YQId.jpg)\r\n\r\n**4/ Does The Shark Uplight APEX Cost a Lot To Maintain Regularly?**\r\n\r\nYes, but thankfully, if you keep your vacuum in good condition, you should never have to spend too much extra money on it.\r\n\r\nThere are just a few parts of your vacuum cleaner, such as the filter you may replace. They are, on the other hand, washable as well as reusable. If you are cautious and give them a thorough cleaning regularly, they may last the whole service life of the vacuum cleaner.\r\n\r\n**5/ How Should You Maintain The Shark Uplight APEX?**\r\n\r\nThere are several components in the Shark Uplight APEX you must adequately maintain. You must wash the three filters very often (once every two months). Cleaning all three filters will take some time because they cannot be machine washed and must be rinsed out by hand after each use.\r\n\r\nAdditional maintenance includes cleaning the dust cup regularly to ensure no trapped material or dirt because they might hamper the performance. Finally, you must sometimes give the main brushroll a good cleaning to ensure that blockages do not develop.\r\n\r\n**Check This Out:** [**Shark APEX UpLight Review: How Good Is This New Stick Vacuum**](https://thekinglive.com/shark-apex-uplight-vacuum.html)?\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nAfter all, why do we use a bulky, ugly, and heavy upright while you could have a more stylish and lighter stick vacuum cleaner like the Shark APEX UpLight? That is the main reason this type of vacuum was born, and it is as the Shark's statement that this vacuum’s appearance will be a change of its image.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this is a highly successful assertion from what we have seen in the **Shark APEX Uplight review**. The UpLights are among the most popular and well-rated stick vacuums for customers and experts today. We hope that this information will assist you in having an educated option.",
