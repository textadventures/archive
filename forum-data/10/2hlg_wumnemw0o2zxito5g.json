I'm doing the text adventure tutorial and noticed that after I added eggs, flour, sugar, milk, beer, and cheese to the kitchen, the game displays them as:\r\n\r\nYou can see a flour, an eggs, a sugar, (etc.).\r\n\r\nI know the cheap and easy way to fix this is to instead call the objects things like \"A bag of flour\", a \"carton of eggs\", a \"bag of sugar\", etc., but I want to know how to make it do both of the below instead:\r\n\r\n\"some flour, some eggs, some sugar\"\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n\"flour, eggs, sugar\"\r\n\r\nI went into the Setup tab for flour and tried changing the Article value to \"some\", but in game it still says \"a flour\". I also tried just deleting the value in the Article field and it still says \"a flour\" in game. \r\n\r\nHow do I solve this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJustin",
