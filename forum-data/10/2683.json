Then I realised that on many of the verbs contained numbers, which the game didn't react to so I had change the names of the verb, however, I found that you couldn't use copy and paste in quest in order to move my big &quot;text blocks&quot;, so now I wonder, how do you change the names of verbs? Not remove and create new ones, but rename them.",
