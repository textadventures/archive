I have identical code in WAKE (only difference being content) that works perfectly. \n\nHowever, in a demo game that I have made, this code is not working properly.\n\nIt requests the user's first name. It then displays that name back to them in a personalized greeting. However, it ignores the first input that a user gives it. You have to type your name into the command line and press enter, and then type your name again and press enter again. On the second try, it works.\n\nHowever - If I delete the &quot;ClearScreen&quot; and test it again, then the code works correctly the first time. Then, every consecutive time it stops working. The same thing happens when adding &quot;ClearScreen&quot; back. I'm fairly certain it is a bug, but I realize it could be a mistake on my part as well. Any help is appreciated. And if it is a bug, any workaround would be amazing as I will have to present this program on Monday or Tuesday.\n\n[code:3p9cl65c]ClearScreen\nmsg (&quot;What is your first name?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font size=\\&quot;2\\&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Type it below)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)\nget input {\n  player&#46;alias = result\n  ClearScreen\n  msg (&quot;It's nice to meet you, &quot; + player&#46;alias + &quot;&#46; Let's get started&#46;&quot;)\n  msg (&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font size=\\&quot;2\\&quot;&gt;(Press any key to continue)&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)\n  wait {\n    ClearScreen\n    msg (&quot;You are at home on your computer, having just finished all of your work for the day&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You smile over the sense of satisfaction you feel in completing everything you've been assigned&#46; As you exhale, the worries on your mind fade away&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it's time to play&#46;&#46;&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You grab your football, baseball glove, and game controller&#46; Who knows what your friends will want to play today?
