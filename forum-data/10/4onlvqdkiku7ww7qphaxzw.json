default new game code for quest:\r\n\r\n(I'm using an older version of quest, but hopefully its still the same default new game code, aside my older '550' version in the top/beginning 'asl' tag line (the beginning tag line is also known as a 'header' or 'signature' as it often has some special parameters in it, such as the 'version', in the 'asl' beginning/header/signature tag line)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref= \"Core.aslx\" />\r\n\r\n  <game name=\"NAME_OF_GAME\">\r\n\r\n    <attr name=\"author\"

</object>\r\n\r\n  </object>\r\n\r\n</asl>\r\n```\r\n\r\ndo you see that the 'asl' tag block is the 'root' parent?\r\n\r\nthe 'asl' tag block IS THE GAME OBJECT ITSELF (it is your game): everything (all code / all game content) must be \"nested\" (contained within) the 'asl' tag block\r\n\r\nwhich, indeed everything is \"nested\" (contained within) the 'asl' tag block\r\n\r\ncan you spot other further nested layers/levels?\r\n\r\nthe 'author', 'version', and 'firstpublished' String Attributes are \"nested\" (contained within) the special and required 'game' Object (as can be seen, this holds the publishing info, and not seen here, it also holds game-wide/global options/controls, the 'pov' feature, the special 'start' Script, and etc such stuff)\r\n\r\nthe 'player' Player Object is \"nested\" (contained within) the 'room' Room Object\r\n\r\nthe 'editor_room' Inherited Attribute is also \"nested\" (contained within) the 'room' Room Object\r\n\r\nthe 'editor_object' and 'editor_player' are \"nested\" (contained within) the 'player' Player Object\r\n\r\nthe 'English.aslx' Include tag line, 'Core.aslx' Include tag line, the 'game' Object tag block, and the 'room' Room Object tag block are all direct children (directly \"nested\" / directly contained wtihin) of the 'asl' tag block\r\n\r\n```\r\nthe 'asl' tag block\r\n-> the 'English.aslx' include ref tag line\r\n-> the 'Core.aslx' include ref tag line\r\n-> the special and required 'game' Object tag block\r\n->-> the 'author' String Attribute tag line\r\n->-> the 'version' String Attribute tag line\r\n->-> the

'editor_object' Inherited Attribute tag line\r\n->->-> the 'editor_player' Inherited Attribute tag line\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, as an outline:\r\n\r\n```\r\nI. the 'asl' tag block\r\n  A. the 'English.aslx' include ref tag line\r\n  B. the 'Core.aslx' include ref tag line\r\n  C. the special and required 'game' Object tag block\r\n    1. the 'author' String Attribute tag line\r\n    2. the 'version' String Attribute tag line\r\n    3. the 'firstpublished' String Attribute tag line\r\n  D. the 'room' Room Object tag block\r\n    1. the 'editor_room' Inherited Attribute tag line\r\n    2. the
