Sorry if these questions have already been answered countless times (which they probably have).\n\nI know you can create rooms to act as 'inventories' for the various characters in a game. But how can they be accessed? I want to allow the player to take an object from a character without being given it. But I need the characters to be able to move around, too, while still having the objects with them. How can I do this?\n\n\nAlso, I want the examine function to be as well-used as possible. But I've just encountered a problem. A character, Sam the janitor, is completely ignoring the player, but when you speak to him, the flag \"Sam interested\" is set. I've rigged the examine function on Sam so that if you examine him before speaking to him, the message describes him, and says he's ignoring you; examine him [i:20sdel5j]after[/i:20sdel5j] speaking, and he's looking at you.\nBut I tried a test-run, and although he's looking at you after you speak to him, if you examine him before speaking, Quest simply displays the message \"examine Sam\". Any idea what's gone wrong?",

I suggest using Al's (MaDbRiT) TypeLib for this sort of thing.  Try emailling him about it.\n\nTo your second question:\nCan you post a demo of your code so we can help you.  Without the code there isn't much we can do.\n\nOh, and by the way, welcome to the Axe Software Forums!",
