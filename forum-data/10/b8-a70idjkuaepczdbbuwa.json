What it is is a custom questing system where you just plug script in Change numbers to match each quest and personalize messages, then bam 5 different quest types. Their kill, bribe, get, give and receive and can customize rewards from exp, unlock door, gold and items. All works pretty good but would really like if you could look at it for me. If so I will send via email.\r\n\r\nJust want to wait until it's better setup then I'll share with everyone:)\r\nMile",
