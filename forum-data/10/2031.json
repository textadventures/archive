(If they don't, I check the inventory and the room for an accessible 'shooting' type object:  if one is found, the appropriate actions are added to the player's &quot;action queue&quot; to make it possible to commit the original action.  The player enacts each action in their action queue sequentially - one action per firing of the afterturn script - which allows them to be &quot;interrupted&quot; by other actors or events.  If no accessible 'shooting' type object is found, a message similar to &quot;You have nothing to shoot the robber with...&quot; is printed.)  \n\nSo it follows that they should be able to type 'shoot gun' when they want to shoot another gun with the gun in their hand.  I need to disambiguate whether the player means 'shoot with the gun I've got' (at nothing, in which case the message would print that they need to choose a target) or 'shoot the other gun with the gun I've got'.  I can't default to interpreting that the player should shoot the other gun with their own gun - Quest will force the player to disambiguate with its popup.\n\nAlso, I have the feeling that if the player has a single gun, and they type 'shoot gun', that I'm going to receive a &quot;You can't shoot the gun with itself...&quot; (since I need to code for attempts like that) rather than &quot;You need to pick a target...&quot;",
