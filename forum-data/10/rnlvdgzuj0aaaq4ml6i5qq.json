Since I made it so removes text upon room transition the player will be unable to read anything. So I want to add the continue button, or hyperlink, that I often see in other games at the end of the text. Pressing it should continue to the room transition. How do I do that? I'm not good with code language and due to my ADHD I tend to have a hard time understanding complicated things, so if anyone can help me, please make it as easy to understand as possible. Make it understandable enough for a first-grader even if you want to. ",
