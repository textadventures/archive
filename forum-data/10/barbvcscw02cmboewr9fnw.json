The {command:go to kitchen:kitchen} lies at the far end.``` but would like to know how difficult it would be to implement object links within the description which when clicked offer interactive options such as **look**, **take** and **use**\r\n\r\nI know the default settings do this, but I'd like something slicker, such as the options popping up on a new line. Something like this (assuming the links are clicked):\r\n\r\nYou are in the hallway. The **kitchen** lies at the far end. \r\n\r\nYou are in the kitchen.
