The NPC itself doesn't have to actually guard the exit, with a custom message on a locked exit you can make it appear as if it is though.  Have the exit itself give a message as though the NPC is either saying or physically doing something to stop you from using it, then when given the item have the exit become unlocked.\r\n\r\nIt's a common technique in games. The code does not need a system for the NPC to block the exit as long as everything given to the player says that's what's happening and it functions correctly.",
