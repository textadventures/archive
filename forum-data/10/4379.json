I wonder if there is a way to refresh room descriptions? Often, you are faced with long walls of text after you have tried out a bunch of things. I already know about the clear window function, but I wonder if there is a way to refresh the room description so you see the changes you made to the room. For example your room might start with a description:\n\n&quot;You are in a bedroom. You see a chair, a book and a table. You can go north and west.&quot;\n\nAfter I pick up the book, I want the description to refresh and notice the change by automatically writing a new line of text:\n\n&quot;You are in a bedroom. You see a chair and a table. You can go north and west.&quot;",

What about the alternative solution that would also allow you to add small changes to the first description you made? For example, description1:\nYou are in a bedroom and the only thing that catches your eye is a book and a table.\nYou see a book and a table.\n\nNow lets say you broke the table and you take the book.\n\nDes2:\nYou are in the bedroom and you don't see anything important.\nYou see some wood remains.",
