I see the v6 repo is 11 months old, and not moved since.\r\n\r\nI don't like rushing devs who do hard work for us all, so please don't take this that way, it's just a question about your future plans.\r\n\r\nOr... Could someone with more brains than me have a look at the questjs repo and see if it's easily fixable to work with the current version of quest?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nLee.",
