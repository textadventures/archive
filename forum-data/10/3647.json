Using the object causes changes in it's own attributes but when a new, identical object is taken I need them to be fresh.\n\nIdeally I want to call these scripts from a function, but it seems to invalidate the use of &quot;this&quot; in the expressions and I get an error message along the lines of &quot;unknown variable or object &quot;this&quot;&quot;.
