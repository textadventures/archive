I think Youtube and Vemo (I think that was the name.) was two, but what about for pictures and sounds?  I forget the name or link and did a search, but came up with 16 pages to look through.  Also are there more that you guys know about that you had not mentioned?  I know I can search for sounds and pics normally, but you gave specific sites with some kind of free use policy or something.",

I will have to check that site out.  I know I tried a soundforge or something like that and it was more for stand alone products than actual sounds, more music or sound makers for different operating systems or at least that is what it appeared to me anyway.
