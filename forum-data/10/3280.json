      "EditableText": "I actually use Visual Studio to edit my game code. I have my main game file and a lot of libraries (all .aslx files). So I created an empty solution in VS and then just added in all the .aslx files. If you're starting out, you'll just have the one, your main game file. If all you want to do is look at the aslx code, then you can just load the .aslx file into VS, without even needing a solution file. \n\nI found that VS will syntax highlight the code (being XML) and helps with respect to editing. The code is a custom XML-formatted language.\n\nThe one downside - if you're editing your main game file, you have to close it out of Quest and reload it after changes. I had heard somewhere that Quest would notice the changed file and prompt you to reload it, but that has never happened for me. \n\nYou can also view and edit the source directly within Quest by clicking the &quot;Code View&quot; button (the one between the &quot;Play&quot; button and the blue Help one on the icon bar - second from the right in Quest 5.2).\n\nHope that helps.",
