I want to make an object \"openable\" after completing a task.  To do this, I made the object an 'openable/closable' container.  I chose this because it is the only option that doesn't seem to automatically spit out a 'Leave blank for Default' option when attempting to open.\r\n\r\nSo... in the script to run when opening an object, I have a flag set that indicates that the previous task has been completed and I check for that flag in the 'If' statement.  I print a message \"You open it and look inside.\"  Now, since this container does not appear to have the automatic 'list children when opened or looked at' option, how can I manually list the children of the envelope when opened and looked at?  I thought it would be something like ListChildren(envelope), but that ain't working!\r\n\r\nI'm probably making this too difficult.  Help me out please.  Thanks.",
