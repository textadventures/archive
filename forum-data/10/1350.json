The dillema is how do I make it so the person doing the sitting sees &quot;You take a seat.&quot; and everyone else see &quot;You see sitter take a seat.&quot; and make it so while sitting, you can't leave the area you are in (you will have to stand to do that).  I thought I had it figured out at one point using flags, but it corrupted the game file so I had to start over.\n\nPlease help,\nShadow",
