It's why you're there, if I want to stop, I will. Just have a \"Deal\" button.\r\n*  You can split any two cards that are the same value. An equal bet is placed on the other hand. You then get only one card on the first  hand and offered any options available(split again or double down) other than that you can't hit again. Then you are  given one card on the second hand and offered any options available, if none, that is the only card you get.
