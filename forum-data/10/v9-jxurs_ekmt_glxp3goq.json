Well, I'm a bit worried (maybe there's no reason to worry, but better safe than sorry) due to the workflow I have for developing the map: currently, the ship is divided in sections, and I place each section as an empty object where I drop the rooms to keep it all organized and easy to navigate on my part.\r\nThe question is: is this a safe method, or will it cause problems in the long run? I plan on making a massive ship with enemy encounters, puzzles, etc. and although I have everything more or less figured, I'd like to know beforehand if I should switch to another way of organizing stuff, before it causes any trouble.",
