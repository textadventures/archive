I'm writing a game in which the player can wear a few different disguises, and I wanted the &quot;look at self&quot; command to return a different description depending on which clothes the player is wearing. I wrote a script that accomplishes this on the &quot;player&quot; object, but Quest will not find and/or run that script; it will only display the default response. I tried editing this, as well, but there is no option to make it refer to a script! Can anyone help me figure out a way around this? I've been working in the GUI, so is there a code-based method to overcome this?\n\n~Torby",
