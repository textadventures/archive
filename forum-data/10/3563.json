GOOD LUCK! lol\n\n(I'll help you through this, so just ask away, as I'm sure you'll need to do so, and this isn't a perfect guide either, I likely got some mistakes and other problems, and oops... I was going to say that if you got this all correct, you'd be dying as I left out a small tweak~addition that is needed lol ... except we haven't set up death yet... so nvm haha... )\n\nI haven't really looked at how the built-in health works, it confuses me too, lol.\n\nhowever, you can just click on this option to turn it off, and create your own health attribute.\n\nin he gui~editor mode, you understand about the left and right panes, correct ?\n\nleft pane, contains the &quot;tree&quot; of stuff:\n\nObjects\n-&gt; Game\n-&gt;-&gt; Verbs\n-&gt;-&gt; Commands\n-&gt; Room\n-&gt;-&gt; Player\nFunctions\nTimers\nWalkthrough\nAdvanced\n-&gt; Included Libraries\n-&gt;-&gt; English.aslx\n-&gt;-&gt;

Player (right pane, the Tab called &quot;player&quot; at top, click on it) -&gt; Show Health box (right pane) -&gt; make sure it is UNchecked\n\nnow, to make your own health attributes:\n\nPlayer (left pane ~ click on it to highlight it) -&gt;

is going to be used, in order, to display your hp as:\n\nHp: 999 / 999\n\nand the &quot;current_hp&quot; and &quot;maximum_hp&quot; is pretty self explanatory, I hope, lol:\n\nHp: (current_hp) / (maximum_hp)\n\n-------\n\nbut, we still got more to do still, so now do this:\n\nPlayer (left pane ~ click on it to highlight it) -&gt;

/ &quot; + game.pov.maximum_hp\n\nThis is the final part, to get it to display it when you're playing the game\n\n---------\n\nbut, while we're here, we're going to set the game turns counter too, so do this:\n\n(still with the turn script stuff) -&gt; Script -&gt; Add New Script -&gt; \n\nSet variable game.turns = [expression] game.turns + 1\n\nalright, we're done with the turn script stuff.\n\n-------\n\nhowever, we got to really quick add the turns attribute, and its status display, to the game object, so now do this:\n\nGame (left pane ~ click on it to highlight it) -&gt; Attributes (right pane, the Tab at the top called &quot;Attributes&quot; ~ click on it) -&gt;  Attributes (the box at the bottom) -&gt; Add -&gt;\n\nname: turns\ntype: integer (select this option from the small box)\nvalue: 0\n\nGame (left pane ~ click on it to highlight it) -&gt;

Script (Tab) -&gt; Start Script -&gt; Add New Script -&gt;\n\nOutput -&gt; Print A Message -&gt;\n\nPrint [message] &quot;What is your name?&quot;\n\nAdd New Script -&gt;\n\nOutput -&gt; Get input -&gt; Get input, then -&gt; run script -&gt;\n\nVariables -&gt; set a variable or attribute -&gt;\n\nSet variable -&gt; game.pov.alias = [expression] result\n\nAdd New Script -&gt; \n\nOutput -&gt; Print A Message -&gt;\n\nPrint [expression] &quot;-&quot;

Add New Script (same as above, such as if you want to do for example, &quot;class&quot; and~or whatever else, just follow the same attern, though it has to be indenting &quot;nesting&quot; further right each time, so be careful, make sure you are clicking on the right script adding buttons, hehe)\n\n(HK's note: I use the  &quot; -&gt; &quot; 's for representing &quot;indenting&quot; or &quot;nesting&quot; of the script)\n\nhere's what an example would look like:\n\n[code:3ny7b4nw]Game -&gt; Script (Tab) -&gt; Start Script -&gt;\n\nPrint &#91;message&#93; &quot;What is your name?&quot;\nGet input, then -&gt; run script\n-&gt; game&#46;pov&#46;alias = &#91;expression&#93; result\n-&gt; Print &#91;expression&#93; &quot;-&quot; + game&#46;pov&#46;alias\n-&gt;

Scripts -&gt; Switch... -&gt;\n\nSwitch: game.pov.class\n-&gt; Cases\n-&gt;-&gt; Key: &quot;warrior&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game.pov.current_hp = [expression] 999\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058;

Script&#058; game.pov.current_hp = [expression] 750\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game.pov.maximum_hp = [expression] 750\n\nthis part can be put after the: &quot;Clear the screen&quot;, see below for how it will look\n(and it gets more messy~complex if you want to have such as male~female affect your starting stats as well too, lol. Switches within switches... enjoy, lol)\n\nhere's what it would look like:\n\n[code:3ny7b4nw]Game -&gt; Script (Tab) -&gt; Start Script -&gt;\n\nPrint &#91;message&#93; &quot;What is your name?&quot;\nGet input, then -&gt; run script\n-&gt; game&#46;pov&#46;alias = &#91;expression&#93; result\n-&gt; Print &#91;expression&#93; &quot;-&quot; + game&#46;pov&#46;alias\n-&gt; Print &#91;message&#93; &quot;What is your age?&quot;\n-&gt; Get input, then -&gt; run script\n-&gt;-&gt; game&#46;pov&#46;age = &#91;expression&#93; result\n-&gt;-&gt; Show menu with caption &#91;text&#93; &quot;What is your gender?&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Options from list/dictionary split (&quot;male;female&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Allow player to cancel &#91;no&#93;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; After choosing, run script\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; game&#46;pov&#46;gender = &#91;expression&#93; result\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Show menu with caption &#91;text&#93; &quot;What is your race?&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Options from list/dictionary split (&quot;human;dwarf;elf;orc&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Allow player to cancel &#91;no&#93;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; After choosing, run script\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; game&#46;pov&#46;race = &#91;expression&#93; result\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Show menu with caption &#91;text&#93; &quot;What is your class?&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Options from list/dictionary split (&quot;warrior;cleric;mage;thief&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Allow player to cancel &#91;no&#93;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; After choosing, run script\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; game&#46;pov&#46;class = &#91;expression&#93; result\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Print &#91;expression&#93; game&#46;pov&#46;alias + &quot; is a &quot; &quot; + game&#46;pov&#46;age + &quot; year old &quot; + game&#46;pov&#46;gender + &quot; &quot; + game&#46;pov&#46;race + &quot; &quot; + game&#46;pov&#46;class +&quot;&#46;&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Wait for key press, then run script\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Clear the screen\nSwitch&#58; game&#46;pov&#46;class\n-&gt; Cases\n-&gt;-&gt; Key&#58; &quot;warrior&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game&#46;pov&#46;current_hp = &#91;expression&#93; 999\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game&#46;pov&#46;maximum_hp = &#91;expression&#93; 999\n-&gt;-&gt; Key&#58; &quot;cleric&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game&#46;pov&#46;current_hp = &#91;expression&#93; 500\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game&#46;pov&#46;maximum_hp = &#91;expression&#93; 500\n-&gt;-&gt; Key&#58; &quot;mage&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game&#46;pov&#46;current_hp = &#91;expression&#93; 250\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game&#46;pov&#46;maximum_hp = &#91;expression&#93; 250\n-&gt;-&gt; Key&#58; &quot;thief&quot;\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game&#46;pov&#46;current_hp = &#91;expression&#93; 750\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Script&#058; game&#46;pov&#46;maximum_hp = &#91;expression&#93; 750[/code:3ny7b4nw]\n\n--------------\n\nlastly is how to change your hp:\n\nall you got to do is to add these wherever you want them to be:\n\n(of game.pov ~ you can do the same on, and so, your enemies~monsters, have hp too, just switch game.pov with your enemy~monster 's name\n\nfor decreasing the hp:\n\ngame.pov.current_hp = [expression] game.pov.current_hp - the_amount_you_want_to_lose\n\nfor increasing the hp:\n\ngame.pov.current_hp = [expression] game.pov.current_hp + the_amount_you_want_to_gain\n\n----------------\n\nthe &quot;character creation&quot; is only for the start of the game, your starting stats.\n\nif you want your stats to change during the game, like at level ups, based upon your, for example, &quot;class&quot;, then, you'll need to ask me how to do this, (and likely you'd need to just ask me how to do a &quot;level up&quot; too, hehe).\n\nnone of this stuff is easy for a noob to do, you really should start out with much simplier stuff first <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) -->\n\n---------------\n\nP.S.\n\nif you're interested in learning to work with the code, it is a lot easier for me to guide you, and also for you too.\n\nit's not easy to help a person through using the gui~editor mode, using the code directly or via Code View mode, is much easier for both of us.\n\n---------------\n\nP.S.S.\n\nI'd recommend working through the tutorial first, get that stuff understood, then you'd be more ready for working with quest.\n\nhere's the link to the tutorial: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Tutorial\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Tutorial</a><!-- m -->\n\nenjoy <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) -->",

      "EditableText": "I'm tired after doing that long explanation, so hopefully you can work with the game code, lol.\n\n--------\n\nDon't worry about using the turn script, in regards to slowing the game down, as Jaynebonne explained to me in a different question that I had asked a while ago, that the game engine can do like trillions of code a second (or whatever lol), so you don't have to worry about any slow down, that is, if I understood him correctly, lol. I think there's no slow down in terms of it processing the code, but maybe if you have a bunch of objects in the game, that may slow down it's initial game load up time.\n\nhowever, you might not want to use the turn script (with the level up function inside of it), as levicki mentioned, there's many ways of doing stuff or locations of where to do stuff.\n\n-----------\n\nPixie helped me do all of this stuff, as I was a full noob back then too, so credit goes to him~her.\n\nAnyways, the level up isn't done in the same way as like with the hp, you do *NOT* want to use the same structure of &quot;current and maximum&quot; for your level up and experience.\n\nthe structure~system we're going to use is this:\n\nwe need to create an equation~formula~algorithm that achieves this (see much further below for the level up function and the equations that I used):\n\n(well, you can set up your equation to however you want to do your exp to level, your level up set up. I decided that I wanted it to be: level 1 = +100 exp needed, level 2 = +200 exp needed, level 3 = +300 exp needed, etc etc etc)\n\nif game.pov*(game.pov = player).exp &gt;= 100, then player.level (0) + 1 = 1\nif game.pov*(game.pov = player).exp &gt;= 200, then player.level (1) + 1 = 2\nif game.pov*(game.pov = player).exp &gt;= 300, then player.level (2) + 1 = 3\n\nso, as you can see, no need for using &quot;current and maximum&quot; experience. We just increase the level attribute by 1 each time, the required exp is met for increasing that level up.\n\n*v5.3 allowed us to have multiple player objects (such as if we wanted to change control between our party members), so in v5.2, there was only the &quot;player&quot; for your control character, now we can make a bunch of &quot;player objects&quot; (such as &quot;Conan, Thor, Odin, etc etc&quot;, and the current control is known as game.pov\n\ngame.pov = &quot;player or frodo (player object 1)&quot; or &quot;conan (player object 2)&quot; or &quot;thor (player object 3)&quot; ~ whoever you've asigned to be controlled\n\nso, in v5.2, it was just: player.experience\n\nnow in v5.3, it is: game.pov, and if you're controlling &quot;player&quot;, then game.pov will show &quot;player&quot; 's inventory for example, and you'll move the &quot;player&quot; around as you play the game. If you're controlling &quot;thor (player2)&quot;, then game.pov will show &quot;thor&quot; 's inventory for example, and you'll move &quot;thor&quot; around as you play the game. So, 5.3 and it's use of game.pov, enables you to have &quot;player&quot; in the castle dungeon, trying to get free, and &quot;thor&quot; in the town, trying to break into the castle dungeon to free &quot;player&quot;, being able to switch between them, controlling one, and then controlling the other, switching back and forth.\n\ngame.pov represents whoever (whichever &quot;player object&quot;) you're currently controlling. But, you can still give specific codes to the individual player objects too, you can still use: player.exp, but that will only apply to your &quot;player&quot; player object. If you use game.pov.exp, that will be used for all of your player objects (&quot;player&quot;, &quot;thor&quot;, &quot;odin&quot;). So, you need to use whichever is the one you want to use: game.pov (game.pov.exp) or the individual player object (such as &quot;player&quot;, player.exp). If you want to keep stats (or whatever stat, separate for each player object, then you don't want to be using game.pov).\n\npov = point of view = who you're controlling\n\nit's game.pov, because the pov is under (a &quot;child&quot; of) the game object.\n\njust as exp is under (a &quot;child&quot; of) the &quot;player&quot; 's as an attribute (in: player.exp)\n\nplayer1.exp = the exp is only an attribute amount (integer) of player1\ngame.pov.exp = the exp is a shared attribute amount (integer) of player1, player2, player3, etc etc etc\n\nSorry, if I'm confusing you more, lol, it's hard to explain this well, at least for me, lol.\n\n-------------\n\nI use the turn script, but you can set up or place this stuff however or wherever you want.\n\nI have a level up function (which does the level up), and then I put it into the turn script, as that will use the function each turn, checking and doing the level up (if you've got the needed exp) automatically.

player.level):\nplayer.level = 0 + 1 = 1\nplayer.level = 1 (from being at level 0)\n\nwith 100 or more exp, you earn level 1 (from level 0)\n\nyou can see how the equation works, by plugging in 1,2,3,etc for player.level, as it tells you how much experience you need\n\nand this equation, deals with the extra experience (AND it resets your exp back to 0 for the next level progression, though + the extra exp too, as you get to keep~use it for the next level progression, hehe):\n\nplayer.experience = player.experience - (player.level * 100 + 100)\n\nso, for example, let's say you drank the 300 exp potion, while at level 0\n\n300 is greater than or equal to 100 (player.level times 100 + 100 -&gt; 0 x 100 + 100 = 100)\nyou don't lose that extra 200, due to this equation:\n\nplayer.experience = player.experience - (player.level * 100 + 100)\nplayer.exp = 300 - (0 x 100 + 100)\nplayer.exp = 300 - 100\nplayer.exp = 200\n\nthen this: player.level = player.level + 1, increases my level:\n\nplayer.level = 0 + 1\nplayer.level = 1 (you're now at lvl 1, with 200 extra ~ carry over ~ exp towards level 2)\n\nand thus because I have a call function script line, &quot;lvlup&quot;, it does the equation over again:\n\nif (player.experience &gt;= player.level * 100 + 100) {\nif (200 &gt;= 1 * 100 + 100) {\nif (200 &gt;= 200) { (yes: 200 = 200)\nthen again check~do the extra exp equation:\nplayer.experience = player.experience - (player.level * 100 + 100)\nplayer.experience = 200 - (1 * 100 + 100)\nplayer.experience = 200 - 200 = 0\nand, also raise the level (as you had the 200 exp that was needed):\nplayer.level = player.level + 1\nplayer.level = 1 + 1 = 2 (you're now at level 2, with 0 extra ~ carry over ~ exp towards level 3)\n\nand here you can see how it's resetting of exp to 0 works too:\n\nso, for example, let's say you drank the 100 exp potion, while at level 0 (and with 0 exp):\n\nplayer.experience = player.experience - (player.level * 100 + 100)\nplayer.experience = 100 - (0 * 100 + 100)\nplayer.experience = 100 - 100 = 0\nyou've earned lvl 1, and you've got no extra exp left~carried over, and thus you're resetted to starting from 0 exp for lvl 2 (from 0 exp to 200 exp to earn level 2) and you've got no (zero = 0) extra experience added to your reset exp of at 0. (if you had extra experience, then it is added to your reset exp at 0, for: 0 + extra exp, towards the next level)\n\nif you got exactly the exp needed for a level up, while having 0 exp, then the player.experience = [b:23wvyi4w]player.experience[/b:23wvyi4w] will equal the [b:23wvyi4w](player.level * 100 + 100)[/b:23wvyi4w], and thus that minus sign will produce 0\n\nstarting at level 0 and 0 exp, getting 100 exp:\n\nplayer.experience = [ player.experience ] [ minus ] (player.level * 100 + 100)\nplayer.experience = [ 100 ] [ minus -&gt; equals ] (0 * 100 + 100) = 0\nplayer.experience = [ 100 [ equals ] (100) = 0\nand so, since there's a minus instead of the equals, it produces 0 (how I achieve the resetting of the exp back to 0, for the next level up)\nplayer.experience = [ 100 ] [ equal -&gt; minus ] (100) = 0\nplayer.experience = [ 100 ] [ minus ] (100) = 0\nplayer.experience = [[ 0 )) = 0\n\n(player.level * 100 + 100) = the exp needed for the level up\n\nso, if you got exactly the exp needed for a level up (and you started with 0 exp), then you're subtracting the same amount, resulting in the resetting of your exp to 0 for the next level. And if you got extra exp (greater exp than the exp needed for the level up or for the &quot;(player.level * 100 + 100)&quot;, then you'll have that extra exp remaining, after the subtraction, for the next level.",
      "EditableFormat": "bbcode",
      "HTML": "I'm tired after doing that long explanation, so hopefully you can work with the game code, lol.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>Don't worry about using the turn script, in regards to slowing the game down, as Jaynebonne explained to me in a different question that I had asked a while ago, that the game engine can do like trillions of code a second (or whatever lol), so you don't have to worry about any slow down, that is, if I understood him correctly, lol. I think there's no slow down in terms of it processing the code, but maybe if you have a bunch of objects in the game, that may slow down it's initial game load up time.<br/><br/>however, you might not want to use the turn script (with the level up function inside of it), as levicki mentioned, there's many ways of doing stuff or locations of where to do stuff.<br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>Pixie helped me do all of this stuff, as I was a full noob back then too, so credit goes to him~her.<br/><br/>Anyways, the level up isn't done in the same way as like with the hp, you do *NOT* want to use the same structure of &quot;current and maximum&quot; for your level up and experience.<br/><br/>the structure~system we're going to use is this:<br/><br/>we need to create an equation~formula~algorithm that achieves this (see much further below for the level up function and the equations that I used):<br/><br/>(well, you can set up your equation to however you want to do your exp to level, your level up set up. I decided that I wanted it to be: level 1 = +100 exp needed, level 2 = +200 exp needed, level 3 = +300 exp needed, etc etc etc)<br/><br/>if game.pov*(game.pov = player).exp &gt;= 100, then player.level (0) + 1 = 1<br/>if game.pov*(game.pov = player).exp &gt;= 200, then player.level (1) + 1 = 2<br/>if game.pov*(game.pov = player).exp &gt;= 300, then player.level (2) + 1 = 3<br/><br/>so, as you can see, no need for using &quot;current and maximum&quot; experience. We just increase the level attribute by 1 each time, the required exp is met for increasing that level up.<br/><br/>*v5.3 allowed us to have multiple player objects (such as if we wanted to change control between our party members), so in v5.2, there was only the &quot;player&quot; for your control character, now we can make a bunch of &quot;player objects&quot; (such as &quot;Conan, Thor, Odin, etc etc&quot;, and the current control is known as game.pov<br/><br/>game.pov = &quot;player or frodo (player object 1)&quot; or &quot;conan (player object 2)&quot; or &quot;thor (player object 3)&quot; ~ whoever you've asigned to be controlled<br/><br/>so, in v5.2, it was just: player.experience<br/><br/>now in v5.3, it is: game.pov, and if you're controlling &quot;player&quot;, then game.pov will show &quot;player&quot; 's inventory for example, and you'll move the &quot;player&quot; around as you play the game. If you're controlling &quot;thor (player2)&quot;, then game.pov will show &quot;thor&quot; 's inventory for example, and you'll move &quot;thor&quot; around as you play the game. So, 5.3 and it's use of game.pov, enables you to have &quot;player&quot; in the castle dungeon, trying to get free, and &quot;thor&quot; in the town, trying to break into the castle dungeon to free &quot;player&quot;, being able to switch between them, controlling one, and then controlling the other, switching back and forth.<br/><br/>game.pov represents whoever (whichever &quot;player object&quot;) you're currently controlling. But, you can still give specific codes to the individual player objects too, you can still use: player.exp, but that will only apply to your &quot;player&quot; player object. If you use game.pov.exp, that will be used for all of your player objects (&quot;player&quot;, &quot;thor&quot;, &quot;odin&quot;). So, you need to use whichever is the one you want to use: game.pov (game.pov.exp) or the individual player object (such as &quot;player&quot;, player.exp). If you want to keep stats (or whatever stat, separate for each player object, then you don't want to be using game.pov).<br/><br/>pov = point of view = who you're controlling<br/><br/>it's game.pov, because the pov is under (a &quot;child&quot; of) the game object.<br/><br/>just as exp is under (a &quot;child&quot; of) the &quot;player&quot; 's as an attribute (in: player.exp)<br/><br/>player1.exp = the exp is only an attribute amount (integer) of player1<br/>game.pov.exp = the exp is a shared attribute amount (integer) of player1, player2, player3, etc etc etc<br/><br/>Sorry, if I'm confusing you more, lol, it's hard to explain this well, at least for me, lol.<br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>I use the turn script, but you can set up or place this stuff however or wherever you want.<br/><br/>I have a level up function (which does the level up), and then I put it into the turn script, as that will use the function each turn, checking and doing the level up (if you've got the needed exp) automatically. Though, this isn't the only way of doing it.<br/><br/>I also have exp potion objects, giving 100 and 300 exp, to test that I have everything working correctly.<br/><br/>here's a quick game code, of an old file I have on this stuff (level up, character creation, race~class level up stat bonuses, and experience potions):<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;2&#46;4515&#46;34846--&gt;<br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;520&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

player.level):<br/>player.level = 0 + 1 = 1<br/>player.level = 1 (from being at level 0)<br/><br/>with 100 or more exp, you earn level 1 (from level 0)<br/><br/>you can see how the equation works, by plugging in 1,2,3,etc for player.level, as it tells you how much experience you need<br/><br/>and this equation, deals with the extra experience (AND it resets your exp back to 0 for the next level progression, though + the extra exp too, as you get to keep~use it for the next level progression, hehe):<br/><br/>player.experience = player.experience - (player.level * 100 + 100)<br/><br/>so, for example, let's say you drank the 300 exp potion, while at level 0<br/><br/>300 is greater than or equal to 100 (player.level times 100 + 100 -&gt; 0 x 100 + 100 = 100)<br/>you don't lose that extra 200, due to this equation:<br/><br/>player.experience = player.experience - (player.level * 100 + 100)<br/>player.exp = 300 - (0 x 100 + 100)<br/>player.exp = 300 - 100<br/>player.exp = 200<br/><br/>then this: player.level = player.level + 1, increases my level:<br/><br/>player.level = 0 + 1<br/>player.level = 1 (you're now at lvl 1, with 200 extra ~ carry over ~ exp towards level 2)<br/><br/>and thus because I have a call function script line, &quot;lvlup&quot;, it does the equation over again:<br/><br/>if (player.experience &gt;= player.level * 100 + 100) {<br/>if (200 &gt;= 1 * 100 + 100) {<br/>if (200 &gt;= 200) { (yes: 200 = 200)<br/>then again check~do the extra exp equation:<br/>player.experience = player.experience - (player.level * 100 + 100)<br/>player.experience = 200 - (1 * 100 + 100)<br/>player.experience = 200 - 200 = 0<br/>and, also raise the level (as you had the 200 exp that was needed):<br/>player.level = player.level + 1<br/>player.level = 1 + 1 = 2 (you're now at level 2, with 0 extra ~ carry over ~ exp towards level 3)<br/><br/>and here you can see how it's resetting of exp to 0 works too:<br/><br/>so, for example, let's say you drank the 100 exp potion, while at level 0 (and with 0 exp):<br/><br/>player.experience = player.experience - (player.level * 100 + 100)<br/>player.experience = 100 - (0 * 100 + 100)<br/>player.experience = 100 - 100 = 0<br/>you've earned lvl 1, and you've got no extra exp left~carried over, and thus you're resetted to starting from 0 exp for lvl 2 (from 0 exp to 200 exp to earn level 2) and you've got no (zero = 0) extra experience added to your reset exp of at 0. (if you had extra experience, then it is added to your reset exp at 0, for: 0 + extra exp, towards the next level)<br/><br/>if you got exactly the exp needed for a level up, while having 0 exp, then the player.experience = <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">player.experience</span> will equal the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(player.level * 100 + 100)</span>, and thus that minus sign will produce 0<br/><br/>starting at level 0 and 0 exp, getting 100 exp:<br/><br/>player.experience = [ player.experience ] [ minus ] (player.level * 100 + 100)<br/>player.experience = [ 100 ] [ minus -&gt; equals ] (0 * 100 + 100) = 0<br/>player.experience = [ 100 [ equals ] (100) = 0<br/>and so, since there's a minus instead of the equals, it produces 0 (how I achieve the resetting of the exp back to 0, for the next level up)<br/>player.experience = [ 100 ] [ equal -&gt; minus ] (100) = 0<br/>player.experience = [ 100 ] [ minus ] (100) = 0<br/>player.experience = [[ 0 )) = 0<br/><br/>(player.level * 100 + 100) = the exp needed for the level up<br/><br/>so, if you got exactly the exp needed for a level up (and you started with 0 exp), then you're subtracting the same amount, resulting in the resetting of your exp to 0 for the next level. And if you got extra exp (greater exp than the exp needed for the level up or for the &quot;(player.level * 100 + 100)&quot;, then you'll have that extra exp remaining, after the subtraction, for the next level.",

It works out how much damage the player does, determines if this killed the goblin, and then gives the player XP if they did (calling the &quot;GetIsLevel&quot; function I made to see if you player leveled up).\n\nWhat I would like to know is whether there is a term I can put in all the expressions I previously put &quot;goblin&quot; that would mean I could just copy this whole verb onto another monster? What would be useful is if I could also get one that replaces that &quot;goblin&quot; with &quot;the target of this action&quot; - as I have made a weapon item and am giving it's &quot;Use&quot; as an alternate way of making your attack.\n\nSo, I'm looking for something I can add into expressions that means &quot;this object&quot; and one that means &quot;what you used this on&quot;. The terms need to work in all forms of expressions (not just in working out who's Resistance stat I'm using against the attack, but also in Print [expression] = &quot;The &quot; + [term] + &quot; survived your attack!&quot;).\n\nIf you could tell me this, I would be very grateful.\n\nEDIT: I have encountered another problem.

You seem to be getting this well, not a single question asked on something not working, with the previous stuff, WOW !!!\n(It took me a long time just to get the character creation working, lol)\n\nIt'll be too hard and long for me to try to help you with doing all this stuff through the GUI-Editor mode, so hopefully, you can pick up working with the code, if you need help, I can help you deal with working~using the code.\n\nyou seem to already know this, but just in case:\n\nyou can view the game file code in two ways\n\none way is in the GUI~Editor mode, at the top is a button that looks like a note paper, between the play and ? (help) buttons. This is a toggle button between the GUI-Editor mode and the Code View mode.\n\nthe other way is to simply open up the game file with notepad, notepad++, or wordpad \n\n(I recommand downloading the latest version of notepad++, it's really handy for working with code)\n\nalso, you can highlight and copy your entire game code, and then post it here (as you've already done, lol), which allows us to look at it, making it easier for us to know what you're doing, trying to do, and how to then help you or fix problems you may have.\n\nAnd use this code (which you already know too, lol) for posting it here:\n\n[code.]you game file code[/code.]\n\nbut without the dots in the [ code ] 's\n\n1. you're now getting into learning about a few more code types, and a bit more advanced stuff, which is needed for what you're asking about now.\n\nVerbs are &quot;local&quot; (they only work on that single object that you created the verb for and on~upon it), for example, the verb you created for your goblin, only works for that single object, which you uniquely named goblin (&quot;Name&quot; attributes are unique, you can never create anything with the same &quot;name&quot;, as the &quot;name&quot; is the identifier for the game engine. However, you can also assign an &quot;alias&quot; attribute, and so multiple objects can have the same alias, as the game engine still continues to identify the object by its name attribute).\n\nfor example:\n\nobject.name.goblin\nobject.name.goblin = error (can't have two objects with the same name attribute, of example, &quot;goblin&quot;)\n\nobject.name.goblin1\nobject.name.goblin2 = no error\n\nthen you can assign alias attributes:\n\ngoblin1.alias.goblin\ngoblin2.alias.goblin = no error\n\ndo note, that if you have an alias, that is what the game player will see. The game player will only see the name if there's no alias. So, you can use the name, to help you catelog~organize~inform you of what the object is for or whatever about it, and then use the alias, for the game player, as you nor the game player, wants to see: name.goblin1_red_mountain_area_50_hp, lol.\n\nalso, when using commands and the &quot;GetObject&quot; function, it'll search for an object with that NAME, which can be a problem as the player tries to type in the alias, and the game engine searches for a NAME and thus doesn't find an object with that word, as that word only exists as an object's alias. There is however, a method to deal with this, but let's not worry about this until it happens, lol.\n\nwhich leads perfectly into the next thing:\n\nCommands\n\nCommands are universal verbs, so this is something you might want to use. Commands operate by the game player typing in an input. Whereas verbs gives you the button to push on the right pane or as a hyperlink in the left pane's text.\n\nhere's an example of how a command can be set up (see the tutorial too, as it helps with learning commands):\n\n[code:1kfwffxh]&lt;command name=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;pattern&gt;attack #text#&lt;/pattern&gt;\n  &lt;script&gt;\n    attack_function (text)\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/command&gt;[/code:1kfwffxh]\n\nthe command is activated by the game player, when he types in (for example): attack goblin\n\nand in this example, it activates the function: attack_function (text)\n\nand now, this leads us into:\n\nFunctions\n\nFunctions can do more things than Scripts, such as assigning parameters and~or return values of a specified type.\n\nso, continuing our example:\n\n[code:1kfwffxh]&lt;command name=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;pattern&gt;attack #text#&lt;/pattern&gt;\n  &lt;script&gt;\n    attack_function (text)\n    OR\n    attack_function (game&#46;pov,text)\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/command&gt;\n\n&lt;function name=&quot;attack_function&quot; parameters=&quot;text2&quot;&gt;\nOR\n&lt;function name=&quot;attack_function&quot; parameters=&quot;self,text2&quot;&gt;\n  enemy = GetObject (text)\n  if (enemy = null) {\n    foreach (obj, AllObjects ()) {\n      if (obj&#46;alias=text) {\n        enemy = obj\n      } else {\n        msg (&quot;There seemingly is no &quot; + text + &quot;here&#46;&quot;)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  do whatever you want here, whatever you got set up for your attack system&#46;\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:1kfwffxh]\n\nso...\n\nParameters\n\nin the command, you got: attack #text#\nthe function call in the command's script, &quot;attack_function&quot;, will use (the parameters) what the game player typed in for the #text#\n\nfor example:\n\ngame player types in: attack goblin\nso now in the command' script's function call line: attack_function (parameter: text) will be known as attack_function (parameter: goblin) to the game engine\n\nnow, in the function: attack_function (text2), the the goblin will now be assigned to the new parameter: text2, which is used within this function itself.\n\ndo note that the carry over from parameter to parameter, is matched up by order:\n\nparameter=&quot;item1=goblin1,item2=goblin2,item3=goblin3&quot;\nnew parameters of new code block=&quot;red,blue,yellow&quot; \n\nso:\n\nred = goblin1\nblue = goblin2\nyellow = goblin3\n\nyou can see this in the example with using the parameters=&quot;game.pov,text&quot;\n\nin the command, game.pov and text is plugged into the call function's parameters: attack_function (game.pov,text)\n\nand now in the attack_function itself, the first parameter, game.pov, is plugged into the new first parameter, self, so game.pov -&gt; self, and the second parameter, text, is plugged into the new second parameter, text, so text -&gt; text.\n\nnow through the game engine, the attack_function will identify any usage of &quot;self&quot; as &quot;game.pov&quot;, so for example if I were to code this inside of attack_function:\n\nself.strength = strength + 50\n\nguess what would happen?\n\nmy game.pov (for example, &quot;player&quot;), would now have 50 more strength, for it's strength attribute (game.pov.strength).\n\nand I do do the same with the other parameter (in this example): text\n\nsuch as coding this inside of the attack_function:\n\nenemy = text\nenemy.strength = enemy.strength - 50\n\nguess what would happen?\n\nthe object that the game player typed in for the attack command, will now have 50 less strength for its strength attribute (such as: orc.strength)\n\nthough you can see it's a bit more complicated... too complicated to explain, unless you want to be using commands like this, lol. Then I'll try to help and explain you through it, otherwise, I don't want to take the time to try to do so.\n\n----\n\nyou can copy and paste your verb code into a function, and create a command that calls upon that function.\n\nthen we'd jsut need to set up the parameters, so that it can work on any object, but the problem is that the object must be typed in by the game player...\n\nyour other option is to simply copy and paste your verb code for each monster~enemy object that you create, lol.\n\n-----\n\nI'm not sure if there's any other way to do it besides, commands and verbs... so maybe someone else can help you then, if there are other ways to do this.\n\n2. Another thing you need to learn is object types (it's under the &quot;advanced&quot; on the left pane's tree of stuff in the GUI~Editor)\n\nobject types enables you to create a &quot;group&quot; of attributes, and then you can simply assign that &quot;group&quot; to your objects, and they'll get all the attributes of that assigned &quot;group&quot;, the term &quot;inherit&quot; is used in the code, see below:\n\nfor examples:\n\n[code:1kfwffxh]&lt;type name=&quot;snake_type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;strength type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/strength&gt;\n  &lt;endurance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/endurance&gt;\n  &lt;dexterity type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/dexterity&gt;\n&lt;/type&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;snake1&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;snake_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;cobra&lt;/alias&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;snake2&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;snake_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;python&lt;/alias&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;snake3&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;snake_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;anaconda&lt;/alias&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;snake4&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;snake_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;black_mamba&lt;/alias&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;type name=&quot;dragon_type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;strength type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/strength&gt;\n  &lt;endurance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/endurance&gt;\n  &lt;dexterity type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/dexterity&gt;\n&lt;/type&gt;\n\n&lt;type name=&quot;fire_elemental_type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;fire_damage type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/fire_damage&gt;\n  &lt;fire_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/fire_resistance&gt;\n  &lt;water_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/water_resistance&gt;\n&lt;/type&gt;\n\n&lt;type name=&quot;water_elemental_type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;water_damage type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/water_damage&gt;\n  &lt;water_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/water_resistance&gt;\n  &lt;fire_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/fire_resistance&gt;\n&lt;/type&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;dragon1A&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;dragon_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;fire_elemental_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;fire dragon&lt;/alias&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;dragon1B&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;dragon_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;fire_elemental_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;Salamander&lt;/alias&gt;\n  &lt;water_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;50&lt;/water_resistance&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;dragon2A&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;dragon_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;water_elemental_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;water dragon&lt;/alias&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;dragon2A&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;dragon_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=&quot;water_elemental_type&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;ice drake&lt;/alias&gt;\n  &lt;fire_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;50&lt;/fire_resistance&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;[/code:1kfwffxh]\n\n3. as for your &quot;order of operations&quot; problem:\n\nyou simply need to order them correctly, lol\n\nwith code~script blocks (including such as: functions, scripts, turn scripts, verbs, commands, and etc, too):\n\nfirst\nsecond\nthird\netc\n\nalso, about turn scripts:\n\nthey can be assigned to different locations:\n\nif you highlighted (by clicking on) &quot;Object&quot; in the left pane's &quot;tree of stuff&quot;, you create a game turn script (universal turn script), it is always running and effecting you.\n\nif you highlighted (by clicking on), for example, &quot;room&quot; in the left pane's &quot;tree of stuff&quot;, you create a turn script locally, just for that object room, &quot;room&quot;, it is only running and effecting you, when you are in that specific place, &quot;room&quot;.\n\nbtw, in the GUI~Editor, you can use the up and down arrows in the little greyish tool bar that appears for when you're coding the script (like with the character creation), to move code lines up and down (allowing you to create a new code line, and then move it up or down to where it needs to be, or jsut move around ~readjust your existing code lines). If you didn't already know this, that is, lol.\n\nlet me look at your game code, to be able to address and help you with your &quot;order of operations&quot; problem(s), so give me some time.",

Another thing you need to learn is object types (it's under the &quot;advanced&quot; on the left pane's tree of stuff in the GUI~Editor)<br/><br/>object types enables you to create a &quot;group&quot; of attributes, and then you can simply assign that &quot;group&quot; to your objects, and they'll get all the attributes of that assigned &quot;group&quot;, the term &quot;inherit&quot; is used in the code, see below:<br/><br/>for examples:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;type name=&quot;snake_type&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;strength type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/strength&gt;<br/>  &lt;endurance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/endurance&gt;<br/>  &lt;dexterity type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/dexterity&gt;<br/>&lt;/type&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;snake1&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;snake_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;cobra&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;snake2&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;snake_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;python&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;snake3&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;snake_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;anaconda&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;snake4&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;snake_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;black_mamba&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;type name=&quot;dragon_type&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;strength type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/strength&gt;<br/>  &lt;endurance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/endurance&gt;<br/>  &lt;dexterity type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/dexterity&gt;<br/>&lt;/type&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;type name=&quot;fire_elemental_type&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;fire_damage type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/fire_damage&gt;<br/>  &lt;fire_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/fire_resistance&gt;<br/>  &lt;water_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/water_resistance&gt;<br/>&lt;/type&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;type name=&quot;water_elemental_type&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;water_damage type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/water_damage&gt;<br/>  &lt;water_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/water_resistance&gt;<br/>  &lt;fire_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/fire_resistance&gt;<br/>&lt;/type&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;dragon1A&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;dragon_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;fire_elemental_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;fire dragon&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;dragon1B&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;dragon_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;fire_elemental_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;Salamander&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>  &lt;water_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;50&lt;/water_resistance&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;dragon2A&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;dragon_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;water_elemental_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;water dragon&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;dragon2A&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;dragon_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;water_elemental_type&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;ice drake&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>  &lt;fire_resistance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;50&lt;/fire_resistance&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>3. as for your &quot;order of operations&quot; problem:<br/><br/>you simply need to order them correctly, lol<br/><br/>with code~script blocks (including such as: functions, scripts, turn scripts, verbs, commands, and etc, too):<br/><br/>first<br/>second<br/>third<br/>etc<br/><br/>also, about turn scripts:<br/><br/>they can be assigned to different locations:<br/><br/>if you highlighted (by clicking on) &quot;Object&quot; in the left pane's &quot;tree of stuff&quot;, you create a game turn script (universal turn script), it is always running and effecting you.<br/><br/>if you highlighted (by clicking on), for example, &quot;room&quot; in the left pane's &quot;tree of stuff&quot;, you create a turn script locally, just for that object room, &quot;room&quot;, it is only running and effecting you, when you are in that specific place, &quot;room&quot;.<br/><br/>btw, in the GUI~Editor, you can use the up and down arrows in the little greyish tool bar that appears for when you're coding the script (like with the character creation), to move code lines up and down (allowing you to create a new code line, and then move it up or down to where it needs to be, or jsut move around ~readjust your existing code lines). If you didn't already know this, that is, lol.<br/><br/>let me look at your game code, to be able to address and help you with your &quot;order of operations&quot; problem(s), so give me some time.",

I guess it's not quite # x #, as Alex likely coded that the sides are like an actual dice (1-6 for each side, for a six-sided dice, 1-8 for each side of a eight-sided dice, in~for his RollDice function, so it's a little different than a straight up times'ing of two numbers, lol. Though, I'm not sure why you couldn't just do two numbers times each other, as you jsut want some random value, actually instead, you should use this:\n\nGetRandomInt (min_amount,max_amount)\n\nfor example:\n\ngoblin_dice_amount = GetRandomInt (50,100)\n\nit randomly selects some amount between 50 and 100, so the choices would be: 50, 51, ..., 99, 100\n\n----\n\notherwise, if you got all the attributes in your attack_goblin script actually created on your goblin object too, then it should be working fine...\n\nDoes everything work fine?

I guess it's not quite # x #, as Alex likely coded that the sides are like an actual dice (1-6 for each side, for a six-sided dice, 1-8 for each side of a eight-sided dice, in~for his RollDice function, so it's a little different than a straight up times'ing of two numbers, lol. Though, I'm not sure why you couldn't just do two numbers times each other, as you jsut want some random value, actually instead, you should use this:<br/><br/>GetRandomInt (min_amount,max_amount)<br/><br/>for example:<br/><br/>goblin_dice_amount = GetRandomInt (50,100)<br/><br/>it randomly selects some amount between 50 and 100, so the choices would be: 50, 51, ..., 99, 100<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>otherwise, if you got all the attributes in your attack_goblin script actually created on your goblin object too, then it should be working fine...<br/><br/>Does everything work fine? It does the attack correctly or not?

very top of screen (File ~ etc ~ Add ~ etc), click on the &quot;Add&quot; and choose &quot;turn  script&quot;<br/><br/>this will always run whatever is in it, always effecting the game.pov and the game as a whole if it can be done so.<br/><br/>this is how we can create &quot;game turns&quot; and then we can use these turns for other things, as each action that the game player does, causes a game turn to go by (to increase)<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;turnscript name=&quot;game_turns_turnscript&quot;&gt;<br/>  game&#46;turns = game turns + 1<br/>&lt;/turnscript&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;game name=&quot;blah blah blah&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;etc blah blah&gt;<br/>  &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>    character_creation_function<br/>  &lt;/start&gt;<br/>  &lt;turns type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/turns&gt;<br/>  &lt;etc blah blah&gt;<br/>&lt;/game&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>if we were to do:<br/><br/>(for example) room (left pane, click on it to highlight it) -&gt; very top of screen (File ~ etc ~ Add ~ etc), click on the &quot;Add&quot; and choose &quot;turn  script&quot;<br/><br/>then we'd create a turnscript that is just for that room, and if we add in the turns code for it, it operate as a &quot;room turns&quot;. <br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;turnscript name=&quot;room_turns_turnscript&quot;&gt;<br/>  room&#46;turns = room turns + 1<br/>&lt;/turnscript&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;turns type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/turns&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>but it gets more complicated:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;turnscript name=&quot;hp_0_and_game_turns_and_death_and revival_spell_turnscript&quot;&gt;<br/><br/>  game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0<br/><br/>  &lt;game_pov_death_script type=&quot;script&gt;<br/>    if (game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0) {<br/>      msg (&quot;You've died!&quot;)<br/>      msg (&quot;GAME OVER&quot;)<br/>      finish<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/><br/>  game&#46;turns = game turns + 1<br/><br/>  &lt;revival_spell type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>    if (game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0) {<br/>      game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0 + game&#46;pov&#46;max_hp<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/revival_spell type&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;/turnscript&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>this would mean that I die (if I have 0 hp) before the next turn happens, and thus before the revival spell can heal back my hp<br/><br/>and you'd die also if it was in this order too:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;turnscript name=&quot;hp_0_and_game_turns_and_death_and revival_spell_turnscript&quot;&gt;<br/><br/>  game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0<br/><br/>  &lt;game_pov_death_script type=&quot;script&gt;<br/>    if (game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0) {<br/>      msg (&quot;You've died!&quot;)<br/>      msg (&quot;GAME OVER&quot;)<br/>      finish<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/game_pov_death_script&gt;<br/><br/>  &lt;revival_spell_script type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>    if (game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0) {<br/>      game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0 + game&#46;pov&#46;max_hp<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/revival_spell_script&gt;<br/><br/>  game&#46;turns = game turns + 1<br/><br/>&lt;/turnscript&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>due to the finish of the game, nullifies the revival spell that occurs afterward, before the next turn<br/><br/>however, if I change the order around, to this:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;turnscript name=&quot;hp_0_and_game_turns_and_death_and revival_spell_turnscript&quot;&gt;<br/><br/>  game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0<br/><br/>  &lt;revival_spell_script type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>    if (game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0) {<br/>      game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0 + game&#46;pov&#46;max_hp<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/revival_spell_script&gt;<br/><br/>  &lt;game_pov_death_script type=&quot;script&gt;<br/>    if (game&#46;pov&#46;cur_hp = 0) {<br/>      msg (&quot;You've died!&quot;)<br/>      msg (&quot;GAME OVER&quot;)<br/>      finish<br/>    }<br/>  &lt;/game_pov_death_script&gt;<br/><br/>  game&#46;turns = game turns + 1<br/><br/>&lt;/turnscript&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>now, even though I have 0 HP, the revival spell is executed first, before the death script and the finishing~ending of the game, and so thus after the revival spell, you now got full HP back, and thus you don't die obviously.<br/><br/>(if you are still dying, than I need to add in the &quot;OnReady&quot; code to the death_script so that it waits for the revival spell to finish before it, the death_script, starts to be executed~run, lol)",
