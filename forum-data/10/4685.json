After that, it will save automatically on a timer.\n\n1. Create timer that will prompt the player on startup. Use this code:\n[code:23srlo2f]request (RequestSave, &quot;&quot;)[/code:23srlo2f]\n\n2. In the start script, add this code:\n[code:23srlo2f]EnableTimer (timer1name)\nSetTimeout (1) {\n  DisableTimer (timer1name)\n}[/code:23srlo2f]\nIf you don't enter it this way, it will keep repeating and they'll never be able to play the game.\n\nNow that the initial save is out of the way, you can enable autosave. This will be a second timer that activates after so many seconds. The way I did it: after their first interaction with my game, it started the autosave timer. This way I know they have that first save out of the way and no errors will be raised. Create your second timer, set the interval for how often you want the game to save, and then enter the same code from the 1st timer.\n\n*I'm sure there are different ways to do it. Maybe better ways. But this is what worked for me on the latest version.\n\n**Not sure you'd be able to autosave in a gamebook.
