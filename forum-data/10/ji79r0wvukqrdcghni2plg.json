      "EditableText": "So I almost have a game done. I'm running some final balance/typo/bug checks, and one thing that has consistently stuck out to me is how the performance in the game just TANKS the longer you play it. Which is a downright _weird_ thing to say about a text game.\r\n\r\n**This'll be a bit long, but please bear with me.**\r\n\r\nA large part of the game is team fights. You and up to 3 allies vs up to 4 enemies in turn-based combat. A lot of it's laid out like a puzzle; \"which teammates do I want for this fight? How do I avoid THIS enemy attack?\" etc.\r\n\r\nHere's the performance issue: When you are IN the fight, the performance gets worse and worse the longer you play the game. So at the start you choose to shoot enemy 1 with a doubleshot. You go into a special 'This is what happens this turn' room and see:\r\n```\r\nYou shoot Enemy1 twice!\r\nX damage!\r\nX damage!\r\n\r\nAlly1 puts a shield around Ally3!\r\n\r\nAlly2 heals Ally3 for X hp!\r\n\r\nAlly3 zaps Enemy1! X damage!\r\n\r\nEnemy1 does something.\r\n\r\nEnemy2 does something.\r\n\r\nCONTINUE HYPERLINK\r\n```\r\nAnd then you press the Continue hyperlink, the screen clears, you're brought to the 'choose your attack' room. And the cycle repeats.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, as time goes on, it begins to stutter. Pauses occur between lines, seemingly at random, regardless of what's happening in the actual fight. The worse the problem is, the longer these pauses are and there can even be _multiple_ ones per new description. There's no rhyme or reason as to WHERE the pauses occur, not that I can tell even after using debug-prints statements.\r\n\r\nThese pauses also occur on the 'choose your attack' room, since the 'choose your attack' room generates its description via script. The description is generally as follows:\r\n```\r\nYOU\r\n50/60 HP\r\n30/75 Energy\r\n\r\nAlly1\r\n60/60 HP\r\n50/75 Energy\r\n\r\nAlly2\r\n50/50 HP\r\n35/100 Energy\r\n\r\nAlly3\r\n100/150 HP\r\n50/55 Energy\r\n\r\nEnemy1\r\n900/999 HP\r\n900/999 Energy\r\n\r\nATTACKS Hyperlink\r\nMISC actions Hyperlink\r\nRUN AWAY Hyperlink\r\n```\r\nAnd there'd be random pauses at, during, and before various chunks of text.\r\n\r\n**As for how the fights work:** I use a lot of Objects and Clones. When a fight starts, I make a clone of a FighterBaseObject that's in a DebugRoom, set its HP and Alias and etc, and move it to the Fight room. I repeat this for all enemies and nonpermanent allies (Permanent Ally FighterObjects are cloned at the start and are simply moved around).\r\n\r\nThis gives me a LOT of flexibility with the fights. I can even make robust buffs/debuffs by having a similar cloning habit with BuffBaseObjects moved into various FighterBaseObjects.\r\n\r\nWhen a given object is no longer needed, I use destroy() to get rid of it, as opposed to Remove so there isn't a million useless objects from past fights just floating around.\r\n\r\n**Here are some things I know the issue isn't.**\r\n\r\nI know it's not one specific fight causing the problem. If I use my developer debug commands to instantly start Encounter 99, defeat that, Encounter 100, 101, and 102, then when I go into Encounter 103 the performance will be virtually unplayable.\r\n\r\nBut if I instead instantly go to Encounter 103, it's just fine until partway into the fight.\r\n\r\n**I know it's not my Fight Code being too complicated**\r\nAfter every character takes their turn, the game checks every clone of FighterObject, and every BuffObject in each FighterObject, and manipulates their attributes as needed with the state of the fight. Since there's a fair few 4v4 fights, I thought maybe it's just taking a while to process?\r\n\r\nBut no. Encounters 99,100,101,103 might all be 4v4s, but Encounter 6, for instance, is much simpler, so is Encounter 7. But if I go through those, the performance still becomes bad.\r\n\r\n**I'm reasonably certain it's not excessive generation/deletion of FighterObjects and BuffObjects by fights**\r\nIf I developer-debug right into encounters 99-103, I get the slowdown issue.\r\n\r\nBut if I do not, if I play normally, walking around a bunch of rooms so that actual fighting is a minority of the play, and go through Encounters 1-4, then encounter 5 will still have terrible performance just like 103 does.\r\n\r\nNow, this COULD be because of another Object clones I produce; you travel around in a spaceship through various solar systems, which I populate via CelestialObjectBase clones to create the stars and planets, and destroy() them when you change systems. But the amount of objects destroyed in this manner is MINUSCULE compared to how many FighterObjects and BuffObjects are destroyed when I go through encounters 99-103.\r\n\r\n**The only idea I have** is that somehow the game stores every move you ever make, and over the course of a longer playtime slowsdown immensely for some reason.\r\n\r\nI would seriously appreciate some help. This is an ambitious game for me, but this performance issue makes it unplayable; I cannot publish something in this state!",

Sadly through the looks of it, the walkthrough wouldn't be much help here, as the game as fairly open ended and has a small amount of  variance; sometimes a fight may last 5 or 4 turns depending on how enemies RNG dodge, and I can't see any way to add conditions to check what's going on in the game.\r\n\r\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, the problem isn't something that just suddenly happens out of nowhere.

      "HTML": "<p>Thanks Anonynn. Sadly through the looks of it, the walkthrough wouldn't be much help here, as the game as fairly open ended and has a small amount of  variance; sometimes a fight may last 5 or 4 turns depending on how enemies RNG dodge, and I can't see any way to add conditions to check what's going on in the game.</p>\n<p>And as I mentioned earlier, the problem isn't something that just suddenly happens out of nowhere. It's a steady decrease in performance over time, eventually becoming worse than I can bear.</p>\n\n",
