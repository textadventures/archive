If interested, you can pm or email me at <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:rjlittlec@juno.com\">rjlittlec@juno.com</a><!-- e -->. I've eliminated as many bugs as I could find. Hopefully there shouldn't be any.\n\nLDS Quest - A small and quirky Mormon game of the sane and supernatural. Rated G for General. \n\nIn LDS Quest, You can learn how to:\nExercize charity\nGain salvation\nReceive the Gifts of the Holy Ghost\nGain faith to move mountains! (Well, at least one.)\nMeet angels!\nCommune with Deity!\nOvercome the adversary!\nPerform miracles!\nDiscover wonders seldom experienced in modern times!\nAnd find out what happens after you enter the New and Everlasting Covenant.\n\nBe careful though, you can lose everything right up through your very last choice!",
