It's used primarily to inject Google Fonts. In the past, we've tried to use it to inject our own local style sheets, with no success. I'm not sure if this was ever fixed.\n\nThe important things about style sheets are that, first, you can define all your styles in one place; second, you separate the content from how it's styled; and third, you can have a single definition for elements that are used repeatedly (e.g. you can have mulitple pieces of string with the &quot;keyword&quot; class, and if you change the style sheet in that one place, they all change style).",
