It looks great on the computer, but on the  iPad (which is primarily what they use), the side panes and margins do not appear. They do need to see their life/atk/def attributes as well as inventory sometimes to play.\r\n  I  tried combing through the forums already but couldn't seem to find a straight forward answer.\r\nThanks  in advance!\r\nMatt",
