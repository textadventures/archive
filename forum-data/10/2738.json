For example, in my game I have many ores that you can smelt into weapons and so on. If you type in 'use iron ore on furnace' the player will more than likely have more than one iron ore, and so every time it will pop up which iron ore you're talking about. It would help for bulk resources that are the same. And of course selecting which object for it to be removed from, because otherwise things would get complicated. \n\nAlso what about drap and drop features, from Quest4? They were really useful and its more annoying to operate things with Quest5 in terms of using items on each other.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",

Maybe in &quot;iron ore2&quot;, have a drop-down so you can say &quot;Treat the same as:&quot; and select &quot;iron ore1&quot; from the list?\n\nI'm not planning to implement the inventory drag and drop feature from Q4 - because I think there is a better way, having a sub-menu from an object hyperlink. But I have no objection if anybody else wants to implement the feature themselves!",
