I thought that the look option would allow me to do that, but as far as I can tell you can't have a look direction and an exit in the same direction. Is there any advice for me or am I missing something obvious? ",

      "EditableText": "Hi! I'm extremely new to this, but what I would do is make an object in the room you're scanning from with an alias of the room you want to scan. Set the object as scenery, and add a verb to it \"scan\". Then have it run a script doing whatever you want the scan to do. As an example, let's say you're in a room called \"inside\" and you want to scan \"outside\". Create an object in the room \"inside\" called \"outside1\" and set its alias to \"outside\". Set the object as scenery. Add a verb to the object \"outside1\" called \"scan\", and have it print a message , \"scanning outside....\". Now play the game and input \"scan outside\" and if should print the message \"scanning outside....\". You can customize this to make it how you want. I hope this helps, and apologize if it doesn't make sense.",
