Let's say Player names themselves \"Alex\". Now, any time I need to use the player's name, I write {player.alias}. This works perfectly... except I have a character that speaks in all caps.\r\nCurrently, if I have that character say, \"HELLO, {player.alias}.\" they say \"HELLO, Alex.\" But I need them to say \"HELLO, ALEX.\" in all caps.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this? If not, I can just have this character nickname Alex, but I'd like to know if this is possible. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n**My Current Code** (where player inputs name):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"He looks up at you as you enter. \\\"What's your name?\\\" he asks.\")\r\nGetInput() {\r\n\tplayer.alias = result\r\n\tmsg (\"<br>Liam offers you a smile. \\\"Cool name, \" + player.alias + \",\\\" he says.<br>\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**My Current Code** (where All Caps Dude speaks):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<object name=\"acivine join\">\r\n\t<description><![CDATA[\"I WONDER HOW MANY POINTS {player.alias} HAS,\" Echolilya says.]]></description>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this reads as:   >>\"I WONDER HOW MANY POINTS Alex HAS,\" Echolilya says.<<",
