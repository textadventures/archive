This could confuse the player if they didn't realize that they should scroll up to read the narration's beginning.  I suggest that the start of the narration should always be at the top of the game window, at least after the game-window is cleared.\n\n-Witch",

      "EditableText": "Thanks Zelimos,\n\nI've already considered the &quot;Wait for player to press a key&quot; option.  Too much of that can ruin the aesthetic quality of the storyline, especially since I use that option for a very specific reason in my game, and deviating from that purpose will more than likely deter a normally non-gamer from associating it with the purpose I use it for.  Plus the fact that if I write narration for 640x480 screen-size, there would be too many of those commands appearing if someone is using a larger screen-size.\n\nThe color-code idea bears the same aesthetic problem.  Colors can also be turned off if chosen to by the player, which would then eliminate its effect and purpose.\n\nThanks for the suggestions, but I still think when a lengthy narration is displayed, the start of the text in the game-window should be upper-left aligned, so the player can scroll down as one would normally do when reading.  The difficulty should not be placed upon the gamer or the game writer, but should be fixed in how it's displayed.\n\n-Witch",
