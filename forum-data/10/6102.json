You can then double click the smell; sniff that was added to the box at the top and add whatever script you want to add when the player tries to sniff or smell the object in question.  Just select a print message script and print whatever message is appropriate.  Note:  if you do not add smell; sniff as a verb, you will get the built in response 'You sniff, but don't smell much' (or something like that).  If you tried to type in 'pummel spoiled milk' (or some other verb that is not built-in) you would get 'I don't understand your command' response (which is built-in as a response to unrecognized verbs).\n\n[attachment=0:fg909zpl]<!-- ia0 -->Screenshot 2016-04-13 22.18.58.png<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:fg909zpl]\n\nAll of those verbs you mentioned are built-in already (and thus recognized) and have a built-in response.
