And the backslash would need to be escaped to avoid Quest trying to parse it, as shown in the example `What\\\\'s next?` above. Or you could use asymmetric/smart quotes (`‘` and `’`), which don't have this problem.\r\n\r\nIf you want the prompt to include bold, icons, or other formatting, you can change `.text` to `.html` and provide any valid HTML string.",
