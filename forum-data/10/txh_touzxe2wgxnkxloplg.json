      "EditableText": "Hello, I'm a newbie working my way through the Quest Game Tutorial. I am on the \"Anatomy of a Quest game\" page. Here it says:\r\n```\r\nObjects can contain other objects. This is done by setting the “parent” attribute. In our simple example, the lounge has no parent - it stands alone. The player is in the lounge, so the player’s parent is “lounge”. If the cat is sitting on the table in the lounge, then the cat’s parent is “table”, and the table’s parent is “lounge”.\r\n```\r\nSo I decided to try this. I added the cat as an object to the table:\r\nLounge\r\n--Table\r\n----Cat\r\n\r\nBut when I play the game and \"Look at table\", the cat is no where to be found. It doesn't show in the table's description, and when I type \"Look at cat\" it says \"I can't see that.\" \r\n\r\nI tried nesting inventory items under the player as well, so they would start the game with the nested items already in inventory, but that didn't work either. Please help?",
