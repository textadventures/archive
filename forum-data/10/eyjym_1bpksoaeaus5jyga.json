If you select an object here, you can click 'move up' and 'move down' to rearrange them. If you try to move an object above the object it's inside of, it probably on't work. There are also some other circumstances where an object won't move, but I haven't been able to figure out what causes it. Moving other objects past the 'stuck' one seems to help in this case.\r\n\r\nSometimes the pane at the left of the editor updates right away, sometimes it doesn't. If it doesn't, you can refresh the page (press F5) to update the left-hand object tree to match the order in the objects tab.\r\n\r\nI assume it's different on the offline editor; but I can't try that because I don't have a Windows computer.",
