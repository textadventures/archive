The only problem I had now is, it's started running a little slower at times, nothing serious but like a 3 second pause after clicking a command sometimes, when earlier it was instant.  And.. I sometimes get random errors such as this \n\nError running script&#058; Error evaluating expression 'status + FormatStatusAttribute(attr, GetAttribute(element, attr), StringDictionaryItem(statusAttributes, attr))': StringDictionaryItem function expected dictionary parameter but was passed 'null'\nError running script&#058; Error compiling expression 'LengthOf(status) &gt; 0': FunctionCallElement: Could find not function 'LengthOf(Object)'\nError running script&#058; Error compiling expression 'status': RootExpressionElement: Cannot convert type 'Object' to expression result of 'String'\n\nThe thing is, these errors werent consistent in appearing, sometimes I could play through without getting the error at all, other times it will appear in different places when new text comes up either after clicking a command or going to a new page.  It seemed to be 50-50 if this will show up or not when playing through the full thing I've made so far.  \n\nI thought maybe it was because I've made a turn script to give the player lots of statuses like &quot;if player x &lt; 75 slightly hungry&quot; etc for many things, theres 23 different &quot;if&quot; commands there so far on that turn script governing all the statuses so far.  It was set to check every 1 second.  I thought that must be what was slowing it down and since I've changed it to check every 10 seconds the game has sped up and these errors have stopped.  \n\nI'm just wondering though, I'm only at the intro of my game and I wanted to make something kind of big, if my intro is say 2% of my total end game.. will I still be able to make the full game alright?  Is there any advice for someone wanting to make a large game, what to do to make sure it doesn't get really bogged down, run slowly, give errors like this?",
