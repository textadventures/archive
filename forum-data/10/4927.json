In an attempt to find the answer to the above I have written a short excerpt which seems to work OK and have then tried using the PUBLISH command. It appears to be producing a file with my game name and a quest extension. But I can find no trace of this file on my system. Looked in the output file ... nothing. Browsed to documents and tried saving it there ... nothing ! I have a lurking feeling that I am doing something very daft . Could some kind soul put me out of my misery before matron confiscates my computer .... Thanks",

      "EditableText": "Thanks folks . It works OK on the desktop so it's probably something to do with the wretched windows 8 thingy ! My current thinking is to enable players to explore or village (with some photographs of locations and object) add a few mythical tunnels etc with some problems to solve (probably about village history) maybe a spot of time travel (I have old photos) . Looking at the software available it seems that Quest is the way to go . Comments from the more experienced (which means all of you ! ) would be appreciated ..Thanks again",
