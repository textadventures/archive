Someone can rock up to textadventures.co.uk make a shit game, get all their mates to give it five stars and then it appears prominent. Players then come along, see it as the best that Quest has to offer and then think Quest is crap. But that's a separate issue to do with the textadventures website and the way it's curated rather than created content. I've seen the sort of system that Alex has implemented here work quite well on other websites. Newgrounds which serves as a hub for flash animations seemed to work quite well on a user submission and rating basis. Beta also for graphics although the management there had some input. I think the difference between IF and knocking together an animation or photoshop funny is the investment of time. Actually animation takes ages if done well but so does IF. I think what textadventures lacks (which has been pointed out today) but exists on forums such as Intfiction is community. We get flashes of it now and again. Maybe it's just the natural cycle that it takes this long for something like Quest to mature? I don't know the answers tbh but it's interesting that some are asking those questions.",
