      "EditableText": "Okay, silly post title. But this is me asking for help for a change.\r\n\r\nI'm experimenting with different narrative devices; and this time I'm going through the main character's childhood memories. As you walk through the woods (which has been enchanted by elves, so all the paths loop back on themselves and shift around), you remember bits and pieces of the events that led to you being here. Some of the memories are doled out at random intervals by a turn script, others get added to the queue when you see a particular item or place that jogs your memory, and some may be unlocked by your actions in the game).\r\n\r\nThe issue that I'm having is the woods. The player's supposed to be wandering around while the memories come to them. You can rush through the area, or you can keep exploring until more of the memories have come out before proceeding to the house to start the main plot. But I want the woods to be more than just a bunch of \"You are in a maze of twisty giant trees, all alike\".\r\nBasically, I'm trying to come up with descriptions for all the \"rooms\" in the woods; and interesting things you could find there (I've got some flowers you can pick, that might come in useful later. But not sure what else there might be). I think for this first stage of the game, any things you find would either just be eye candy, or would be \"normal\" items (that might be found in the woods, or maybe dropped there) that might turn out to be useful later.\r\n\r\nCan anyone offer any ideas; or even a short room description or two?",
