Everything was running smoothly until recently, when the text associated with links stopped saving so the link doesn't show up when I play the game. The save button is greyed out, so I just tried refreshing my 'play' window to see if the changes had applied like they usually do. But, they hadn't, so I edited the main text field for the page to get the save button to activate again then I saved. Still nothing. I even tried completely deleting the first page that was affected and remaking it to no avail. All the pages I made after the problem occurred have been affected. I don't know how to get the game file to attach when using the web version, so I can't attach it. Has anyone else had this problem before? Thanks!  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
