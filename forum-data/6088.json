You could do this for your command if you want all &quot;listen to [object]&quot; to have the same output.  Add command.  Type listen to #text# and add a print msg script like, 'You listen to that, but you hear nothing' or you can print msg 'I don't understand your command.', but that, to me personally, doesn't make sense.  You could also type listen to #object# and the default for a matched object would be whatever you want to change it to, or in the event of an unmatched object, I think it will print &quot;I can't see that.&quot; (or something like that).",
