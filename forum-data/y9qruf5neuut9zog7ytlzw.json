I'm working on a quest game and I have found how to set the background image for the game overall, but I have been unable to figure out how to actually change the background image. I know such a thing is possible because I've seen it done, but I'm just unsure of how to do so. Essentially, I would like to \"Visual Novel\" style have a different background image for each room. \r\n\r\nI've found some posts from way back on here mentioning it but some of what was said I didn't understand or didn't work when I tried it. I have a feeling it's something I'll have to do manually in the code rather than the UI so I'll probably need careful instructions because I'm incredibly unfamiliar with directly using code. Can anyone help me figure this out? Thank you! ",

One of my friends helped me find the SetBackgroundImage (filename) code so I have that part done, but the only thing I don't know how to do is change the way the image is displayed. Rather than centering it as one single background image it automatically tiles the image at its original size to fit the window. So I'm not sure how to set the image size and location. ",
