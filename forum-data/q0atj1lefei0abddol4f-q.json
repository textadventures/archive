Let me explain:\r\n\r\nIn my game, there are two variables that are constantly affected by the player's choices: Health and Sanity. I have created a function in the game that causes the player to be immediately transported to a game over page upon reaching zero Health or Sanity. The function works fine; the page loads without any trouble to speak of. The issue is that everything on that page is displayed twice, when I would prefer that it be displayed once. I've tried looking at the code view to see what I've done wrong, but it's all way over my head. Can anyone help me?",
