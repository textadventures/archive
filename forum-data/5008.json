Just go into the code view and copy the part you've already done.  Once it's copied, delete, then create the &quot;if&quot; statement you needed to be around it.  Once that's in place, just paste the copied code back in wherever it's now needed.  Very quick and easy to do.  If you don't know how to do things with code view, we can walk you through it (it's not difficult, and will make a lot of things a lot easier going forward).",
