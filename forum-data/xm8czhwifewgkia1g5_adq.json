I think I'm doing quite alright so far but I do seem to get stuck on certain bits as I progress through the game. The forums have been helping a lot as well as the document tutorials but one thing that I am finding difficult is changing my player into a different player.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm planning on doing is making an item in the inventory of the player usable and depending on what the actual player (person playing my game) types in, the player will become one of the few other available players.\r\n_For example:_ Bob uses the item in his inventory, player types in the phrase \"Dave\" and Bob transforms into Dave. Dave is now playable until the player chooses to transform back into Bob. I also want each player to have unique abilities (although I think I can manage that using verbs but then again, I'm not entirely sure). And I noticed that some topics were answered with coding and I have no idea how to code here so can you please describe it to me like I will with what I have so far.\r\n\r\nI already have the item in the player's inventory. Under Use/Give (for the item), I have a script that says Print Message which displays instructions on how to transform (to be added later on, of course), underneath is Switch: \"text\" -> Cases: Dave --> Change player object to object Dave. I tested it in game and I'm only able to use the item which displays the instructions but \"Dave\" can't be seen. I'm not sure where to put the Dave object so I moved it inside the item (player->Item->Dave). Like I said, I'm stuck at this part and not really sure what else to do as this seems a little advanced for me but necessary for my story. Thank you to anyone that helps me with this.",

I already have the item in the player's inventory.\r\n\r\n2. Under Use/Give (for the item), I have a script that says Print Message which displays instructions on how to transform (to be added later on, of course) // and ask them for the typed-in input\r\n\r\n(let's say they're currently 'Bob', and they want to change control over to 'Dave' Player Object, so during game play, they type in: Dave)\r\n\r\n3. (see below) --- this is a good link on using 'get input' Script and etc stuff: http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/guides/character_creation.html\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'get input' Script\r\n\r\n(with the 'get input' and 'show menu' Scripts/Functions, quest automatically, and hidden from you, sets the 'result' variable to your choice: result = YOUR_TYPED_IN_INPUT_OR_YOUR_MENU_SELECTED_CHOICE, which you can then use this 'result' variable for whatever you want, such as in your 'switch' Script/Function as seen: switch (result) { cases (blah) { blah } } stuff)\r\n\r\n4. (see below)\r\n\r\nthen,\r\n\r\n-> add new script -> underneath is Switch: result -> (see below)\r\n\r\n-> -> Cases: \"Bob\" --> Change player object to object Bob.\r\n-> -> Cases: \"Dave\" --> Change player object to object Dave.\r\n-> -> (etc) Cases: \"WHOEVER/ETC\" --> Change player object to object WHOEVER/ETC.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nexplanation of the 'pov' System:\r\n\r\nthe default new game Player Object is the 'player' Player Object\r\n\r\nyou can have more Player objects, which are the characters that you can control --- but only one at a time obviously:\r\n\r\nthus, you switch control amongst them, in who you're currently controlling, which is done via the 'ChangePov(NAME)' Script/Function in code, or in the GU~Editor: 'change player object to object BLAH' Script/Function\r\n\r\nyou can reference your CURRENTLY CONTROLLED Player object (pov), via using this Attribute 'game.pov', but you got to be careful, as it'll apply to whoever is your pov (CURRENTLY CONTROLED Player Object), which you may not want, for example:\r\n\r\nlet's say you got a reward in game for doing something, +5 strength, but you only want it to occur (be given) to/for 'dave', and not 'Bob'\r\n\r\nwell if you use this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadd new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable game.pov.strength = [EXPRESSION] game.pov.strength + 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen you'll get the +5 strength increase to WHOEVER is your pov (currently controlled Player object): so even if you're 'Bob', then Bob's strength will be increased by 5, when you didn't want Bob to be able to increase his strength, you only wanted 'Dave' to be able to increase his strength.\r\n\r\nwhereas, if you used this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadd new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable Dave.strength = [EXPRESSION] Dave.strength + 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nit'll give +5 strength to Dave, regardless of whoever you're currently controlling\r\n\r\nif you only want it to give the +5 strength to Dave, only when/if you're currently controlling Dave, then you need to do some 'if' scripting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadd new script -> 'scripts' section/category -> 'if' Script -> [EXPRESSION] -> (see below)\r\n\r\nif [EXPRESSION] game.pov = Dave\r\n\r\nthen,\r\n\r\n-> add new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable Dave.strength = [EXPRESSION] Dave.strength + 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nso, you got to be careful in whether you use, for this example, 'game.pov.strength' vs the individual Player Object references: 'Bob.strength', 'Dave.strength', 'player.strength', 'player2.strength', etc.\r\n\r\non the other hand, if you DO want something to be applied to WHOEVER is your pov, then the 'game.pov' is great.\r\n\r\nanother great example of this is with 'experience / experience points / exp / xp', do you want all of your Player Objects to get 'experience' upon killing a monster, or do you want just that specific individual Player Object you're currently controlling, which is killing the mosnter, to get the 'experience', and NOT any of your other Player Objects?
