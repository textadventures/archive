The other matter was just a comment, however it would be nice to be able to save the size of the pic to a percentage so that no matter what the size of the screen would be the pic would alter itself. eg if the size of the pic was at 80% then no matter what the screen size is then the pic would always be at 80% of the screen. Frontpage and dreamweaver are but two of web creators that allow for this, hopefully at some point Alex might be able to build this into future versions.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
