I am trying to create a game and need to count days. so basically i want a certain set of pages to be repeated 15 times, then open an option to continue the game forward. I'm going to have the player roll a die, select the page based off what they roll, then go back to the page where they need to roll a die. i need them to do this 15 times, then the options for going to pages based off the rolls disappears and an option to continue forward to appear. ive been trying to get a counter working that will increase by one every time they enter the page but havent been able to get it working. can someone help please? thanks! btw im doing a gamebook, not text adventure.",
