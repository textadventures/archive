It would bring even more people to Quest and open up all new avenues of approach and ideas for game makers and fans alike.  Obviously other commitments are due first, but any possible chance for additions to the Quest Family in the near future?\r\n\r\nPs. Also I am not sure if this is the right place for it, but I do not see a suggestions section so... ^_^",

Not to fiddle with code and try to make something resemble what they want, which would discourage them in most cases and never come back.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when they bring up the main Quest interface, instead of only having two game options greet them TA and CYOA, they have four with RL and D&D included.

Both are gaining a resurgance in popularity and both are wonderful ways to tell stories in their own way.\r\n\r\nI will have to check out those links Pixie, thank you.  I was unaware Q was at one time online player enabled.  That was either before my time or during one of my long hibernation cycles... ^_^\r\n\r\nAnd only 20mb limit to upload to the Q webversion or even the desktop one?  I prefer the desktop anyway as last I heard it had more features and functionalities and on a random internet disconnect my work would still be saved.  Since I have never uploaded the game I guess no warning of the 20mb would appear would it?  Makes me wonder how many pics I can actually use before I hit that limit...\r\n\r\nNo way to circumvent or stretch that limit?
