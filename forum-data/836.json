How can you hold more than one of the same object? there is by definition only ONE instance of the \"same object\".\n\nTake a $10 bill as an example. It's an object. You can't ever be holding the same ten dollar bill \"twice\" there is only one of it, but you can hold two essentially [i:1njem6rp]similar[/i:1njem6rp] $10 bills at the same time [i:1njem6rp]but they are not the same object twice, they are two unique objects. [/i:1njem6rp]\n\nOf course in a game you might want to have the player pick up cash and add to his funds, you'd do that with a dummy object which when picked up adds and when dropped reduces the value held in the players funds. You would be highly unlikely to use multiple objects to simulate cash, much more likely you'd use a status variable to hold a total of cash held.\n\nExplain in more detail what you are trying to achieve and I'm sure someone will help you.\n\nAl (MaDbRiT)",
