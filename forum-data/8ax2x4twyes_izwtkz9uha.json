Just tried it again on my Win7Pro System with updated Java and Chrome Version 59.<br>\nBecause Java Installer gave an alert after installation, because of a function, which is not longer supported by google chrome, I've tried a build under firefox. Same result: if clause went wrong.<br>\nI can't explain such things.</p>\n<p>Maybe I \"should not use squiffy\" ;-)</p>\n<p>But I don't give up and wait for an answer from textadventures.co.uk. Maybe they are finished sometime with serverupdate.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your great support Richard!</p>\n\n",
