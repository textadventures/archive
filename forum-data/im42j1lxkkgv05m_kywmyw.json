I'm trying to make it so that there's an option in a list you have to unlock by first using another option from that list, and then once you use that option it adds the hidden option to the list. I'm sure it's something relatively simple but as stated I am very new to this and cannot for the life of me figure out what I should select/code to have this occur, so any help would be appreciated.
