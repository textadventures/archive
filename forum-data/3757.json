All progress on a game I've been working on stopped dead in its tracks as soon as I tried implementing this.\n\nIt should be noted that I am making a gamebook. But what I am trying to do is take a variable and increase its value a step after repeatedly performing an action. I am assuming I have to use the &quot;for&quot; script in order to do this, but I've no idea how to make it work. Something to do with creating a stringlist, right? Thing is, I don't even know what I'm doing there either.\n\nI am sure this is a really simple issue and has been answered before, but I looked and couldn't find exactly what I was trying to do. Or if I did, I simply didn't understand it since I'm a newbie to all of this.",

Like if the variable value is &lt; 50, then whatever characteristic the variable is used to describe becomes X, but if it is &gt; 50, it becomes Y instead. I am also looking to be able to set a fixed maximum and minimum value as well, because I want certain actions in the game to affect these variable values and I don't want actions that decrease the value to go below zero or the actions that increase the value go beyond whatever I'd like the maximum to be.\n\nI can't use counters, because, or at least as far as I know anyway, you cannot have the text read out the counter values. You also can't fix the minimum and maximum values in the way I want or be able to increase the values by a specified number, as I want some actions to increase or decrease the variable values more than other actions.\n\nI hope this is comprehensible, and I truly appreciate the help.",
