But, I'll tell you about my current problem:\r\n\r\n(NOTE: I DID NOT ADD ZOMBIE ATTACKS, BECAUSE I COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK.)\r\n\r\nSo, the weapons in the game, currently are a hammer and a snub nose revolver. I was testing out the combat system(using the hammer) and got this error:\r\n\r\nError running script: Error compiling expression 'GetRandomInt(1, 20) + weapon.attack - target.defence': ArithmeticElement: Operation 'Add' is not defined for types 'Int32' and 'Object'\r\n\r\nIf you need any more information, I'm happy to give it to you.\r\n\r\n(By the way, please dumb things down for me... because I'm very stupid.

      "EditableText": "First up, I notice that your list of parameters to `DoAttack` is a little confused.\r\n\r\nThe parameters for DoAttack are `weapon, target, attacker, firearm`.\r\n\r\nWhen the player does \"attack corpse\" without a weapon, you run the line:\r\n* `DoAttack (player, player, object)`\r\nso the parameters are:\r\n  * `weapon` is set to `player` (that's right; it should use the player's attack and damage values when unarmed)\r\n  * `target` is set to `player` (I think that's wrong)\r\n  * `attacker` is set to `object` (so that's the zombie)\r\n  * `firearm` is set to… well, it isn't set. Which is why attacking without a weapon causes an immediate error about the wrong number of parameters.\r\n\r\nI think that should be:\r\n* <code style=\"color:green\">DoAttack (player, object, player, false)</code>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if you have a weapon equipped, the line in the 'attack' command is:\r\n* `DoAttack (player, player.equipped, object, true)`\r\nso the parameters are:\r\n  * `weapon` is set to `player`\r\n  * `target` is set to `player.equipped`\r\n  * `attacker` is set to `object`\r\n  * `firearm` is set to `true`, whether or not the weapon is a firearm. I'm guess you want it to be <code style=\"color:green\">false</code>, so that if the player has the pistol equipped but is out of ammo they can still pistol whip the zombies by choosing \"attack\" rather than \"shoot\".\r\n\r\nThen you get the arithmetic error. I guess that it's defence, rather than attack, which is giving the error. Because `target` is set to your weapon, and the baseball bat doesn't have a defence.\r\n\r\nSo I think the line should be:\r\n* <code style=\"color:green\">DoAttack (player.equipped, object, player, false)</code>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the `attackturnscript`, your line:\r\n* `DoAttack (obj, obj, player)`\r\n\r\nshould probably be\r\n* <code style=\"color:green\">DoAttack (obj, player, obj, false)</code>\r\n\r\nand in the \"shoot\" command,\r\n* `DoAttack (player, player.equipped, object, true)`\r\n\r\nshould probably be\r\n* <code style=\"color:green\">DoAttack (player.equipped, object, player, true)</code>\r\n\r\n\r\nI also note that your zombies never attack because `attackturnscript` is not enabled. Did you disable it for testing?\r\n\r\nYour `DoAttack` stat also uses the weapon having a `firearmdamage` attribute to determine whether it's a firearm or not, and ignores the `firearm` parameter. This would mean that you can effectively use your gun after you've run out of ammo, just by choosing \"Attack\" instead of \"Shoot\". But I suspect that in reality it will generate another error message.\r\nIt also sets the variables `damageatt` and `attackatt` but never uses them.\r\n\r\nI think your `DoAttack` function could probably be amended to something like:\r\n```\r\n    if (firearm and HasString (weapon, \"firearmdamage\")) {\r\n      damagestat = weapon.firearmdamage\r\n      attackstat = weapon.firearmattack\r\n      weapon.ammo = weapon.ammo - 1\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      damagestat = weapon.damage\r\n      attackstat = weapon.attack\r\n    }\r\n    roll = GetRandomInt(1, 20) + attackstat - target.defence\r\n    damage = DiceRoll(damagestat) * (100 - target.armour) / 100\r\n    if (damage < 1) {\r\n      damage = 1\r\n    }\r\n    if (roll > 15) {\r\n      report = \"crit\"\r\n      damage = damage * 3\r\n    }\r\n    else if (roll > 10) {\r\n      report = \"attack\"\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      report = \"miss\"\r\n      damage = 0\r\n    }\r\n    if (firearm and HasString (weapon, \"firearm\" + report + \"desc\")) {\r\n      report = \"firearm\" + report\r\n    }\r\n    target.hitpoints = target.hitpoints - damage\r\n    AttackReport (GetString (weapon, report + \"desc\"), attacker, target, 0)\r\n```\r\nI moved the `AttackReport` to the end to avoid repeating code inside the `if` block. In this version, the gun can optionally have attributes `firearmattackdesc`, `firearmcritdesc` and `firearmmissdesc`, in case you want to have different descriptions for shooting or pistol-whipping zombies. A little bit more realism :)\r\n\r\nThat's all the issues I could find on a quick glance through the code. Hope that's been some help.",
