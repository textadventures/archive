I suggest though that the likes of that reviewer have consigned other games to oblivion by similar meaningless arbitrary ratings.\n\nThat type of &quot;reviewer&quot; has a certain profile: many games in the sandpit, usually makes multiple &quot;reviews&quot; within a very short space of time, often tries to advertise their own games - often asking for good ratings or demanding they not receive bad ones, one star ratings of decent games are accompanied by short, meaningless comments which suggest (or even prove) they have not played the game, &quot;reviews&quot; and comments suggest illiterate or very young individuals - even taking into account the fact of non-native English users.\n\nAn attack of such &quot;sandflies&quot; can unfairly sink a game from public view. A good example is my father's game Curse! by Peter Edwards. A sandfly bit with a one star review saying he didn't know how to start the game. The game was then changed to make it simpler for those with less patience or imagination. However, another sandfly (who had been in conversation with the first on their own sandpit games) chimed in with a low rating of her own, admitting that she had not played the game but wanted to reiterate the point made by the first. She had not even engaged with the game to find out what it was, but was simply rating in support of her sandfly friend.\n\nI'm sure there are other games that have also been blighted by immature abuse of the open ratings system. Although it's annoying, we had reconciled ourselves that perhaps it's just an unavoidable unpleasantness. But if blatantly thoughtless and unreasonable reviews of that sort can be identified and dealt with, perhaps it would be fair to have a procedure for appeal. (The trouble is, of course, that every sandfly would be complaining to the Admins about their own (quite deserved) low ratings!)\n\nIn the end, it's a shame that idiots can have such an effect on the visibility of games into which some thought and energy has been invested.\n\nI wonder what the solution is? It would be nice if Curse! and other unfairly blighted games could get some justice too. Failing that, some sympathy and a cup of tea would do.\n\nRant over. Merry Christmas everyone (even sandflies)",

It would just broaden the scope for the same abuse.\n\nThe real problem, as I see it, is how ratings affect the visibility of games. Good games get impossibly mixed up with the bad, and no-one knows where to look for them. If visitors are prepared to go through all the games and search for reviews that are both meaningful and positive then there's no problem.\n\nMaybe an answer could be having various different ways of searching for games. We have genre categories, but perhaps a tag system like IFDB would be good. When you can only list games with reference to rating or newness, it's easy for a game to get lost from the public eye forever. Maybe a tag system would give all games a fair chance of being spotted in a search?\n\nIn other words, if we don't think it's feasible to successfully legislate for the silly-rating-culture, and it's too much work to have more top-down indications as to where the quality is (beyond Editor's Picks), maybe we could keep everything as it is, but introduce a system (eg. tags) that makes reviews less consequential to the exposure a game can expect.",

Good games get impossibly mixed up with the bad, and no-one knows where to look for them. If visitors are prepared to go through all the games and search for reviews that are both meaningful and positive then there's no problem.<br/><br/>Maybe an answer could be having various different ways of searching for games. We have genre categories, but perhaps a tag system like IFDB would be good. When you can only list games with reference to rating or newness, it's easy for a game to get lost from the public eye forever. Maybe a tag system would give all games a fair chance of being spotted in a search?<br/><br/>In other words, if we don't think it's feasible to successfully legislate for the silly-rating-culture, and it's too much work to have more top-down indications as to where the quality is (beyond Editor's Picks), maybe we could keep everything as it is, but introduce a system (eg. tags) that makes reviews less consequential to the exposure a game can expect.",

You don't have to be a writer-type (e.g. who can work out the English-like Inform script) or a programmer. It can be used by kids and adults alike, by amateurs and pros. I think that's a great thing, but then you end up with school kids alongside seasoned IF authors. There is no way to compare, and we really shouldn't. (One tack we took on SM was to split pieces up into Amateur and Advanced.)<br/><br/>What we really need is not so much to dis the honest efforts of people with less skill (to  be honest, despite the poor spelling and grammar and over-usage of &quot;colloquial&quot; language, that game you highlighted had more logic in place than some Gamebook games I've seen on Quest. It looked like there was at least a decent amount of effort put in) as we need to promote what is good, to let people see what is possible with Quest in the right hands.</blockquote><br/><br/><br/><br/>I am honestly really not interested in dissing the games themselves, just drawing attention to potential (and occassionally realised) problems with how the ratings are being applied. I'm all for kids playing with Quest, and publishing their efforts, and seeing some of those make it into the main games listings. But I think you have agreed that it's not a perfect world when a game like the one I posted becomes an actual <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">show-piece</span> for Quest.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I think splitting into something like Amateur and Advanced is a great idea.",

I was fortunate enough to see my game rise to the #1 spot in RPGs. I was curious as to why. \n\nI looked at N7 the (AMAZING) game that was just one place below it. \n\nThe only reason I passed him was because of ONE 3 star review. Even though this REALLY benefited my game (it's exposure has grown exponentially), I feel like N7 got cheated. One average review took him from the top spot. His game has 3000+ more plays than mine, but yet I'm above him. \n\nAll this to say that I think people who write 5/5 reviews are not the problem. It's the people who write the lower ones.

      "HTML": "Interesting stuff. I noticed these ratings really do change the outcome of a game. My game (first one ever) received 4 5/5 ratings and I was very very happy with this. I was fortunate enough to see my game rise to the #1 spot in RPGs. I was curious as to why. <br/><br/>I looked at N7 the (AMAZING) game that was just one place below it. <br/><br/>The only reason I passed him was because of ONE 3 star review. Even though this REALLY benefited my game (it's exposure has grown exponentially), I feel like N7 got cheated. One average review took him from the top spot. His game has 3000+ more plays than mine, but yet I'm above him. <br/><br/>All this to say that I think people who write 5/5 reviews are not the problem. It's the people who write the lower ones. They can really mess up a game's path. I am honestly SCARED to review people badly because I don't want my game to suffer the same fate because of a revenge review.",

I have seen people on Amazon who have one-starred a wonderful product simply because it wasn't delivered quickly enough. And, of course, Amazon has people looking through the reviews to see if they actually meet some standard, for at least (I assume) explaining why the rating was given. That might be another solution - let people rate, but then hold the *reviews* to some standards, deleting those that don't at least explain why they were given the ratings they were given. That might prevent the level of arbitrariness we're seeing.\n\nOf course, what we really need are just a lot more quality people writing reviews.

It's no exaggeration to say that 95% of the games I've sifted through so far (and it's a fair few) have had to go in the Sandpit category, and a good 80% of those were either nothing more than short stories written with Inklewriter, test games, unfinished, broken, bugged, or just kids messing around. The number of games with description such as 'jduyhhfdhfhfdheufhuihcbuieipf' and other gibberish is ridiculous.<br/><br/>I think a lot of authors uploading test games simply forget to switch to 'unlisted' before hitting publish, but even then you can tell just from their test game that the finished thing is unlikely to be any better.",
