Only by removing the map can it display a picture AND text.  (I tried resizing the map to a very small size but even that didn't work)\r\n\r\nSecond, and this may or may not be a glitch, but if at some point in the game I want to run a turn script moving the player to another location, the map function no longer works.   There is no way of knowing where the player will be located when the turn script triggers, so I can't move player through every rooms in sequential order to get to the desired location (which I guess the map would tolerate).  \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?",
