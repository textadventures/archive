      "EditableText": "Hi, I used an ancient version of Quest a few years ago and having just downloaded Quest 5. I'm liking the interface but having trouble working a few things out.\n\nRight now I want to create a typable command for looking out of a window so the player can type &quot;look (ANYTHING) window&quot; and it will run the same script, avoiding the need to create a bunch of commands. For example, they could type 'look through window', 'look out of window', or even 'look circus window', the outcome will be the same regardless. In the old Quest (2.0, I think) #...# meant any word or group of words could be used. How do I do this in Quest 5?\n\nApologies if this has been answered elsewhere, I've scoured the forums and read the custom commands wiki page but found nothing. Thanks!",

      "EditableText": "jaynabonne grrrrrr, Like mostlyuseless, I too for the past 10 moths have been using multiple custom commands like ( open window, open the window, open the glass window etc etc. But reading your reply has got me headbutting the walls going derr derr. I know that you can use the #text# when you are talking to someone but I didn't know you could use it like that. still you live and learn. That will help tremendously, maybe I should have read the instructions better on the packet before embarking on this journey. But that's me .Thanks again have a good day.
