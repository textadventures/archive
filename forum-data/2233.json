My game is set up with Panes Off, and the room descriptions are Words Only.\n1)  I want it to display &quot;You are in....&quot; text each time the room is entered.  I wrote that text into the script for when the player enters the room.  When the player enters the room, the window displays the room description, then this scripted text.  - How do I get it to show the scripted text first?\n2) I'd like the player to be able to see takeable objects when they are present just by looking at the room.  - How?\n\nOther than the tutorial, is there any other location for cookbook-type how-to's?\n\nThanks!",
