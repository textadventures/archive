I have the input done - recursive functions that get an input, convert it to int, and store it as an XCoord and YCoord attribute, and can properly throw errors if the player enters r56rg$ or some nonsense. I can even get it to print the specific character in the specific string the player indicates using Mid.\r\n\r\nWhat I can't do is seemingly the most simple; actually CHANGING that one character in a string. I've looked through the functions and I can't seem to find the right syntax for doing this. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance!",
