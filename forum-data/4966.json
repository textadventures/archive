I change the background image a few times, but maybe I'll limit that as it's just flavour really. And yeah, audio doesn't really take up much as it's largely small loops with smaller single hits over the top all compressed to MP3. Was just useful to have a figure in mind so I don't get too carried away.",

I changed the .quest to a .zip and opened it, and a file that shouldn't have been there was somehow swallowed up into the .quest. I removed it, changed the file back to .quest, and the game is now published and awaiting moderation. Thanks so much for the help!",
