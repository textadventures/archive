I've written a better, more powerful and easier to use replacement library which is called \"typelib.qlb\" and has been available (albeit a beta release) from my website since Sept 2002. \n\nThe website beta version of 'typelib.qlb' is as far as I know pretty stable, and is due (shortly) to be replaced by a further enhanced second beta release - actually it is so much improved it might be wiser to give it a different name, the beta test jury is out on that one at the moment.\n\nAl",
