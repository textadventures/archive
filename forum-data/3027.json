What I want to do, is upon entry to certain rooms, call a function that randomly determines if a monster should spawn, and if so, clones one in the player's current room I can tell it to call the function but don't seem to have a code editor type of interface to let me type in my own complex script. Any examples of this? Just not doable with the web version? Doable in standalone version? Doc on how to do it somewhere?\n\nP.S.\nI downloaded the stand-alone version and that works. Is there a way to get my quest file from the web version downloaded so I can continue working on it locally?",
