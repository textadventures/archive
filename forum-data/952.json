I know you probably get a lot of idiots like me coming in and asking stupid questions but I've been trying to figure these two things out for days and I've made no progress with the help files and such that the game comes with.

I have typed the script for \"objects that can be given to X\" (with 'Y' as my 'object that can be given') AND for \"objects that Y can be given to\" (with 'X' as my 'object that Y can be given to'). It always comes out saying \"hard as you try, you find you cannot do that\". I know this questions seems rather vague but I can't figure it out... I have specified the gender for my 'X' object - making it a 'person'... I have tried numerous, obscure things but nothing works...\n\n -- Though the above question is not my top priority at the moment, if possible, it would be nice to have some light shed upon it.\nQuestion 2 is my top priority --\n\n2. When trying to 'look' at certain objects, I encounter a \"Run-time error '9': Subscript out of range\"\n\nThanks in advance for the help... and again, sorry if I'm a bother or am wasting forum space...\n\n~JB",
