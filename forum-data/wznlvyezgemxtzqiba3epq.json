You lose!\")\r\n  finish\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(In text adventure mode, `finish` causes a game over and prevents the player entering more commands. If it's a gamebook you'd miss that line out and just don't give the player any options to  carry on)\r\n\r\nIf you're more familiar with the script GUI, you can go into code view just long enough to paste the commands, and then switch back. Code view makes it a lot easier to share code on the forums.\r\n\r\nHope that helps. If there's anything I missed, please let me know.",
