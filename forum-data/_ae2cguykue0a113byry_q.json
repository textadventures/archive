      "EditableText": "Hi All, I cant for the life of me figure this out and im sure its simple. I have object links in various colours e.g  <b>1)<u>{object:Berry1}</u></b> and if a player clicks on it he has 3 verb options look at, take and eat. Now if the player chooses the eat option i want this object link to disappear.  I know i can do it in a menu style but then he does not have the verb options and cant eat it as such. He can only click on it defeating the purpose. \r\n\r\nI even tried destroy name, object link etc but it only put the color back to default black on the link.\r\n\r\nHope im making sense here. Hope someone can help.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
