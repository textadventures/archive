Your character, officers, and army all have their own set of stats. On occasion a challenge will appear and you need to roll a stat to see if you pass or fail it.  The number of dice you roll is equal to your stat and every 5 or 6 counts as a success.\r\n\r\nI have a general idea about how many variables I will need (ie, a LOT) but I was inexperienced in in putting them together with quest even before I became rusty with quest xP\r\n\r\nHelp, suggestions, feed back is welcome!",
