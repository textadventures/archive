My question is about the math of the chances of the more rare fish.```\r\n\r\nI am making an XCell document to track my food items, and I am trying to build equations into it to show me the actual chance of either of 2 characters catching each fish, so I can adjust the base amount to find a good game balance.\r\n```\r\nSo, we have Fish Base Chances:\r\nR% = Roach at 22% base\r\nC% = Carp at 18% base\r\nP% = Pike at 12% base\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe have Character Skills which are added:\r\nH$ = Harumi, with a 12% bonus to Fish Base Chances\r\nK$ = Kahko, with a 7% bonus to Fish Base Chances\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, on my XCell sheet I have Columns and Rows like so:\r\n\r\n........... Base Chance ... Harumi Chance ...Kahko Chance\r\nRoach |\r\n..Carp |\r\n...Pike |\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, here's how I calculated the Roach Rows, very simple\r\n\r\nHarumi Roach Chance (HR!)\r\n\r\nHR! = R% + H$ = 0.22 + 0.12\r\n\r\nKahko Roach Chance\r\n\r\nKR! = R% + K$ = 0.22 + 0.07\r\n```\r\nBut since the Carp can only be caught if the Roach is not, and the Pike can only be caught if both Roach and Carp are not, I am not confident that my Math is right on the following...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHarumi Carp Chance (HC!)\r\n\r\nHC! = (C% + H$) * (1 - HR!) = (0.18 + 0.12) * (1 - 0.34)\r\n\r\n```Harumi Pike Chance (HP!)```\r\n\r\n```HP! = (P% + H$) * (1 - HR!) * (1 - HC!) = (0.12 + 0.12) * (1 - 0.34) * (1 - 0.2)```\r\n\r\n\r\nI know this a lot of boring text, but I do not want to start working off a faulty foundation, so if a Math whiz could confirm that I have done this right, or tell me how I did it wrong, I would be very, very grateful!",
