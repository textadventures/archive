But I installed Quest on Wine using the usual setup file, which includes this DLL, so I'm at a loss as to how to fix this - and it's not something I can really put much into, as tweaking Quest under Wine would mean repeatedly rebooting into Windows, then Linux, then Windows, then Linux...\n\nAs a suggestion for Favardin, try creating a \"My Documents\" folder.

At some stage I will add the ability to connect to QuestNet Server through Telnet, so you could play QuestNet games without having Quest installed at all.
