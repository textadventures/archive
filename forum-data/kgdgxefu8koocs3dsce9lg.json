Give answer.  Speak again and get second riddle.  Give answer.  Speak again and get last riddle.  Give answer.  Speak again to see if you are correct.  This allows for levels of gifts to be awarded based on the number of riddles being answered correctly (if you want to do that).\r\nYou can copy-paste what I did, or... for your scenario....\r\n1.  Instead of automatically moving on regardless of the first answer being right or **wrong**, you only change the flag settings on the right answer ONLY.\r\n2.  You would also NOT need to add an attribute and adjust it as I did.  Simply ask the appropriate riddle based on which flag is set.\r\n\r\nI do things a bit... _awkward_ I think and there might be an easier way to do this, but this is how I have learned it.\r\nI think it would be most helpful to open a brand new game and copy-paste everything I have in there and then you can kind of use it as a template.\r\n\r\nAsk if you have questions.  Sorry if I'm confusing!\r\n\r\nGood luck!",

Go to game script tab and set a flag on your NPC.  I named mine one.\r\n3.  Add to the 'speak to' verb on the NPC an 'If'  script.\r\n4.  If object NPC has flag name one, then ask first riddle.\r\n5.  Add a 'Get Input' script and add a switch script to it.  In the switch box, type LCase(result).  In the case box, add a string of acceptable answers IN QUOTES and SEPARATED BY COMMAS.  In the default section under the case box, add a message indicating the player got it wrong.\r\n6.
