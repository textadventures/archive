(Sorry for that) I would like to create an Ace Attorney type game, (mostly the cross examination part), which would mean a few thing:\r\n\r\n1- I need the have close option, preferably with clickable choice\r\n\r\n2- I need a life counter, as player would be able to make a limited amout of mistake.\r\n\r\n3- I need an inventory, for counter-fact\r\n\r\n4- I need the ability to create text loop, with the capacity to change only a part of the loop (if possible for the secound part)\r\n\r\n5- I would like to be able to have an ancyclopedia, as there might be a lot of new therms, or things I won't whant to repeat every 10 second because it's needed like two chapter later. Also, it could be usefull for it to be accessible at all time.\r\n\r\nI look everywhere for a good editor for that kind of project, and Quest seems to be the closest I found. If someone could help me, either by explaining me how to do it with Quest, or by suggesting me another program, it would be apreciated.\r\n\r\nnature1996\r\n",
