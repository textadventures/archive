The first is the conversation library, the second is a more general way to implement speech/ talking to NPC's (Non-Player Characters) in your game.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Library:-Conversations\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/conversations.html\r\n\r\nHope this helps.",
