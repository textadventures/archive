So I think I have come up with two choices, 1. create a command that tests if the player is 'in' something - I don't know how to do that and react accordingly, or 2. create a function and pass in true if the player is in the bed or on the chair or false if the player types stand up from somewhere else.  Is this even close to being the correct way of looking at the problem or am I completely off-base?  Thank you.",
