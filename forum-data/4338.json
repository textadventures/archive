Neither worked.\nIt updates the site for a couple of minutes and then says in a little part of the page that the connection with the site was lost.\nThe file size is 124 MB, I edited the library's templates.\nI've tried uploading with Opera and Firefox.\nThe name of the file is &quot;Ancaria Stories.quest&quot; if that matters.

I believe I have uploaded files roughly have the size you mention, but I would hope the site would handle gracefully files even as large as yours. I'm not sure if the problem would lie with the website or with something more local, like your internet provider.",
