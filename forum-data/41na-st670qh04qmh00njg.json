The reason player is in expression is, I suspect because \"nickname\" of the \"player\" itself may be changed, so in order for Quest to identify the player when this happens, it becomes an expression that goes after the \"player\" even if it's not called as \"player\". Technically it's kind of similar to go after its name instead of the alias.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\nOr I hope you get a better help soon >.<",
