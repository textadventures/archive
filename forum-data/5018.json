I still work on figuring stuff out for hrs (even days and entire weeks) too. Coding isn't easy to learn quickly. Try to do something on your own for a bit, but soon as you realize you just can't figure it out, get help, no reason to try to figure out something on your own, when you can't. Sometimes, you can eventually figure something out on your own, but usually not. Give yourself a set time to try to figure out something on your own (say 3-5 hrs), and once that is up, don't waste any more time, go get help. Trying to do stuff on your own is good, as your brain is racing to figuring out how to code something (which is teaching your brain to think in code logic, which is very good, even if you totally fail to figure out how to do the thing). Eventually... we will take less and less time to code stuff correctly... it's a slow learning process, but as the saying goes 'a thousand mile journey, begins with a step, then another, and another, and slowly those small tiny steps will build up to learning to code well&quot;.\n\nand sides, it's not your fault, it's my fault for not providing good instructions on how to do it, hehe.\n\nlet me try to do a better job, giving you specific instructions, step by step...\n\n------\n\nthere's 2-3 ways to display stuff to the person playing the game:\n\n1. the right panes'~sides' boxes: 'inventory', 'places and objects', 'status', 'compass', and etc... (if there's any more of them)\n\n(for stat displayment, we would add to the setup of the the special 'statusattributes' StringDictionary Attribute, which *ONLY* works for the special 'game' Game Object and Player Objects, which makes them appear in the right pane's~side's box called 'status' )\n\n2. the left side's~pane's large text box\n\n(which the main way would be doing it as a Command, adding~using 'msg' Scripts for its scripting)\n\n3. a qwasi-3rd method is via the 'popup window' feature, such as from using the 'show menu' Script.\n\nI'll let you pick which displayment method is best for you and your game.\n\n-----\n\nlet's start with the most complex one to set it up correctly: the 'statusattributes' method\n\nthe special 'statusattribute' StringDictionary Attribute, is *MERELY TO DISPLAY* the Attributes in the 'status' box during game play. In other words, if your attributes don't exist, they can't be displayed. The 'statusattributes' does *NOT* create attributes, it merely displays them on the right side during game play. This causes some confusion with people. Creating~Adding and Displayment, are two very different things. You can't display an Attribute that doesn't exist, and NOR are you creating an Attribute by just merely causing a displayment of a message for the person playing to see during play.\n\n-----\n\nso, to CREATE (Add) Attributes in the GUI~Editor:\n\n(whatever) Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Attributes (NOT Status Attributes) -&gt; Add -&gt; (set them up, see below, repeat as needed for each Attribute)\n\n(Object Name: whatever)\nAttribute Name: (whatever)\nAttribute Type: (String, Integer ~ int, Boolean, Object, Double, Script, StringList, ObjectList, StringDictionary, ObjectDictionary, ScriptDictionary)\nAttribute Value: (whatever, but based upon your Attribute Type, of course)\n\n*HOWEVER, since you want specifically for these Attributes to be displayed in the 'status' box during game play, your Object (that you're adding~creating the Attributes for) must be either:\n\n1. the special 'game' Game Object (highlight the 'Game' Object in the left side's 'tree of stuff', then set up the attributes for it, as shown above)\n\n*The 'game' Game Object holds your game's global settings (which you can set~decide upon), so it's a special~unique Object.\n\n2. Player Objects (such as your default 'player' Player Object or your own custom Player Objects)\n\nso, for what you want (I'll be using the 'player' Player Object as our Object):\n\n'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (see below, repeat for each Attribute)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: attunement\nAttribute Type: int (integer)\nAttribute Value: 5 (just for example, use whatever numerical value you want)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: coordination\nAttribute Type: int (integer)\nAttribute Value: 5\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: fighting\nAttribute Type: int (integer)\nAttribute Value: 5\n\nnow, since you want a math equation (an Expression), this is where (why), you're failing, as you've got no idea that you need to do this unknown tricky part:\n\nas you found out, you can't use a math equation directly for~in your Status Attributes, as it doesn't work as you know quite well. NOR can we use it directly for~in an Attribute as well. For the math equation to work, we need to use Scripting to (indirectly) set it to a (new) Attribute, which we'll then use that in~for the StatusAttributes.\n\n----------\n\nbut, before we get to this tricky stuff, let's make one more last Attribute (you'll see why later):\n\n(you were on the right track in your brain thinking, great job!, you almost got it, except there's no way you could know how to do it correctly, yet you still came up with the right way of doing it!)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: ability\nAttribute Type: int (integer)\nAttribute Value: 0 (this value of '0' is just for you to see it working, obviously if you're starting value is 15 '5+5+5', then you'd hve this set to initially display '15', not '0' )\n\n--------\n\nthere's 2 ways to do the needed scripting:\n\n1. using a (global) Turnscript\n2. using the special 'changed' Script Attributes\n\n---------\n\nThe (global) Turnscript method:\n\nTurnscripts (and Timers) are like '(mostly: depends on their setup and scripting): ALWAYS' running~activating~executing Functions, which works well for updating Stats (Attributes and their displayment via Status Attributes) in games. If you haven't learned about Functions yet (and also if you haven't learned about Commands yet too), then think of them as like your Verbs, except they're open-ended scripting (not tied to an Object).\n\nclick on the upper left 'object' in the left side's 'tree of stuff', so that it is highlighted (this is so that our created~added Turnscript will be global, vs just working for~in a specific Room, as we don't obviously want this, as we want to see our updated Attributes everwhere within the game, lol)\n\n(I don't know why 'Turnscript' isn't displayed in the left side's 'tree of stuff', as it's 'twin', Timer, is shown, meh)\n\nnow, go to the bar at the top of the screen (due to the above comment), click on the 'add', and select 'Turnscript'.\n\nTurnscript Name: (whatever)\nEnabled: yes (check in the toggle box)\nScript&#058; (see below)\n\n[code:3am0wgfk]player&#46;ability = player&#46;attunement + player&#46;coordination + player&#46;fighting[/code:3am0wgfk]\n\nor, via GUI~Editor:\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see above: just type it in here, or see below, lol)\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting\n\n-------\n\nThe special 'changed' Script Attribute method:\n\n(the special 'changed' Script isn't shown in the GUI~Editor, well maybe it is somewhere, meh. I don't know the GUI~Editor's stuff very well, lol)\n\nyou just add 'changed' to the beginning of the specific Attributes for the Attribute Name, and set it to Attribute Type: Script, (see below)\n\nand what the 'changed' does is this conceptually: when~if this attribute's value changes, then do the following scripts\n\nbut what you can do, to is to create it manually instead, in the GUI~Editor:\n\n'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (set it up, repeat for each attribute)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: changedattunement (NO space nor any other character~symbol between 'changed' and your attribute's name, as this is very exact syntaxing needed for it to work)\nAttribute Type: Script\nAttribute Value: (see below)\n\n[code:3am0wgfk]player&#46;ability = player&#46;attunement + player&#46;coordination + player&#46;fighting[/code:3am0wgfk]\n\nor, via GUI~Editor:\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see above: just type it in here, or see below, lol)\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: changedcoordination\nAttribute Type: Script\nAttribute Value: (see below, yes it's the same exact scripting for all 3 of your attributes)\n\n[code:3am0wgfk]player&#46;ability = player&#46;attunement + player&#46;coordination + player&#46;fighting[/code:3am0wgfk]\n\nor, via GUI~Editor:\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see above: just type it in here, or see below, lol)\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: changedfighting\nAttribute Type: Script\nAttribute Value: (see below, yes it's the same exact scripting for all 3 of your attributes)\n\n[code:3am0wgfk]player&#46;ability = player&#46;attunement + player&#46;coordination + player&#46;fighting[/code:3am0wgfk]\n\nor, via GUI~Editor:\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see above: just type it in here, or see below, lol)\n\nrun as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting\n\n----------\n\nnow that we have either the Turnscript or the special 'Changed' Script Attributes, updating our 'ability' Integer Attribute, as the 'attunement', 'coordination', and~or 'fighting' Integer Attributes change ...\n\nNOW, we can set up our Status Attribute:\n\n'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Status Attributes (NOT Attributes) -&gt; (set it up, see below)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: ability\n(Attribute Type: String Dictionary)\nFormat String (Attribute Value): (see below)\n\nthe 'Format String' (Attribute Value) field is a bit confusing~complex, so let me explain it:\n\nactually... let me ignore explaining it for now... as it's outside of this specific step by step guide post for you, lol. I don't want to make this any more confusing than it is already, laughs.\n\n[code:3am0wgfk]if you want to get into this, then you can see if this helps for now (if not than ask me, and I'll help), I have example game files (hopefully, they'll work for the current quest version, as they're old)&#58;\n\nhttp&#58;//forum&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/viewtopic&#46;php?f=10&amp;t=4946&amp;start=15#p34198[/code:3am0wgfk]\n\nso, set it up like this:\n\n'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Status Attributes (NOT Attributes) -&gt; (set it up, see below)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: ability\n(Attribute Type: String Dictionary)\nFormat String (Attribute Value): Ability: !\n\nthe '!' will display the Attribute's Value\n\nso, as of right now, conceptual (and in pseudo-code: I'm lazy) explanation of what it will display:\n\nplayer.ability = 0 (after you see this all working for you, obviously you don't want this to be showing '0', when in this example, it is actually starting at '15', not '0')\nplayer.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting\nplayer.ability = (5) + (5) + (5)\nplayer.ability = 15\n\nStatus Attribute:\n\nability = Ability: !\nability = Ability: (15)\n\noutput (what you'll see in the 'status' box during game play):\n\nAbility: 15\n\nand as your 3 Attributes change, it'll adjust to the new sum of them, for example:\n\nplayer.attunement = 10\nplayer.coordination = 5\nplayer.fighting = 5\n\noutput:\n\nAbility: 20\n(10 + 5 + 5)\n\n------------\n\n[b:3am0wgfk][size=150:3am0wgfk]oops... forgot this last very important thing... lolololol[/size:3am0wgfk][/b:3am0wgfk]\n\nthe 'status' box will display this:\n\nAbility: 0\n\nuntil, you cause it to update, which you can do so by (one way):\n\njust click on the command bar at the bottom during game play, and type in whatever, a simple 'p' will do and hit the 'enter' key on your keyboard, and now it should update to show:\n\nAbility: 15\n\n----------\n\nHK edit: err... I forgot you wanted the 'sum of the 3 Attributes divided by 3', hopefully you can know~figure out how to put this into it, if not let me know.\n\n-----------\n\nand now hopefully it works fully for you... let me know if it doesn't (I might be missing or messed up something, or you might have messed something up, let me know, and we'll troubleshoot it, so that it works for you)\n\n-----------\n\nas for the other 1-2 methods (Commands or the 'popup' menu box), if interested, I'll make a separate post for them, as I'm tired now... lol.",

Player Objects (such as your default 'player' Player Object or your own custom Player Objects)<br/><br/>so, for what you want (I'll be using the 'player' Player Object as our Object):<br/><br/>'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (see below, repeat for each Attribute)<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: attunement<br/>Attribute Type: int (integer)<br/>Attribute Value: 5 (just for example, use whatever numerical value you want)<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: coordination<br/>Attribute Type: int (integer)<br/>Attribute Value: 5<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: fighting<br/>Attribute Type: int (integer)<br/>Attribute Value: 5<br/><br/>now, since you want a math equation (an Expression), this is where (why), you're failing, as you've got no idea that you need to do this unknown tricky part:<br/><br/>as you found out, you can't use a math equation directly for~in your Status Attributes, as it doesn't work as you know quite well. NOR can we use it directly for~in an Attribute as well. For the math equation to work, we need to use Scripting to (indirectly) set it to a (new) Attribute, which we'll then use that in~for the StatusAttributes.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>but, before we get to this tricky stuff, let's make one more last Attribute (you'll see why later):<br/><br/>(you were on the right track in your brain thinking, great job!, you almost got it, except there's no way you could know how to do it correctly, yet you still came up with the right way of doing it!)<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: ability<br/>Attribute Type: int (integer)<br/>Attribute Value: 0 (this value of '0' is just for you to see it working, obviously if you're starting value is 15 '5+5+5', then you'd hve this set to initially display '15', not '0' )<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>there's 2 ways to do the needed scripting:<br/><br/>1. using a (global) Turnscript<br/>2. using the special 'changed' Script Attributes<br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>The (global) Turnscript method:<br/><br/>Turnscripts (and Timers) are like '(mostly: depends on their setup and scripting): ALWAYS' running~activating~executing Functions, which works well for updating Stats (Attributes and their displayment via Status Attributes) in games. If you haven't learned about Functions yet (and also if you haven't learned about Commands yet too), then think of them as like your Verbs, except they're open-ended scripting (not tied to an Object).<br/><br/>click on the upper left 'object' in the left side's 'tree of stuff', so that it is highlighted (this is so that our created~added Turnscript will be global, vs just working for~in a specific Room, as we don't obviously want this, as we want to see our updated Attributes everwhere within the game, lol)<br/><br/>(I don't know why 'Turnscript' isn't displayed in the left side's 'tree of stuff', as it's 'twin', Timer, is shown, meh)<br/><br/>now, go to the bar at the top of the screen (due to the above comment), click on the 'add', and select 'Turnscript'.<br/><br/>Turnscript Name: (whatever)<br/>Enabled: yes (check in the toggle box)<br/>Script&#058; (see below)<br/><br/><pre><code>player&#46;ability = player&#46;attunement + player&#46;coordination + player&#46;fighting</code></pre><br/><br/>or, via GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>run as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see above: just type it in here, or see below, lol)<br/><br/>run as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>The special 'changed' Script Attribute method:<br/><br/>(the special 'changed' Script isn't shown in the GUI~Editor, well maybe it is somewhere, meh. I don't know the GUI~Editor's stuff very well, lol)<br/><br/>you just add 'changed' to the beginning of the specific Attributes for the Attribute Name, and set it to Attribute Type: Script, (see below)<br/><br/>and what the 'changed' does is this conceptually: when~if this attribute's value changes, then do the following scripts<br/><br/>but what you can do, to is to create it manually instead, in the GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (set it up, repeat for each attribute)<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: changedattunement (NO space nor any other character~symbol between 'changed' and your attribute's name, as this is very exact syntaxing needed for it to work)<br/>Attribute Type: Script<br/>Attribute Value: (see below)<br/><br/><pre><code>player&#46;ability = player&#46;attunement + player&#46;coordination + player&#46;fighting</code></pre><br/><br/>or, via GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>run as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see above: just type it in here, or see below, lol)<br/><br/>run as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: changedcoordination<br/>Attribute Type: Script<br/>Attribute Value: (see below, yes it's the same exact scripting for all 3 of your attributes)<br/><br/><pre><code>player&#46;ability = player&#46;attunement + player&#46;coordination + player&#46;fighting</code></pre><br/><br/>or, via GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>run as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see above: just type it in here, or see below, lol)<br/><br/>run as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: changedfighting<br/>Attribute Type: Script<br/>Attribute Value: (see below, yes it's the same exact scripting for all 3 of your attributes)<br/><br/><pre><code>player&#46;ability = player&#46;attunement + player&#46;coordination + player&#46;fighting</code></pre><br/><br/>or, via GUI~Editor:<br/><br/>run as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; (see above: just type it in here, or see below, lol)<br/><br/>run as script -&gt; add a~new script -&gt; variables -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' -&gt; [EXPRESSION] -&gt; player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>now that we have either the Turnscript or the special 'Changed' Script Attributes, updating our 'ability' Integer Attribute, as the 'attunement', 'coordination', and~or 'fighting' Integer Attributes change ...<br/><br/>NOW, we can set up our Status Attribute:<br/><br/>'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Status Attributes (NOT Attributes) -&gt; (set it up, see below)<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: ability<br/>(Attribute Type: String Dictionary)<br/>Format String (Attribute Value): (see below)<br/><br/>the 'Format String' (Attribute Value) field is a bit confusing~complex, so let me explain it:<br/><br/>actually... let me ignore explaining it for now... as it's outside of this specific step by step guide post for you, lol. I don't want to make this any more confusing than it is already, laughs.<br/><br/><pre><code>if you want to get into this, then you can see if this helps for now (if not than ask me, and I'll help), I have example game files (hopefully, they'll work for the current quest version, as they're old)&#58;<br/><br/>http&#58;//forum&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/viewtopic&#46;php?f=10&amp;t=4946&amp;start=15#p34198</code></pre><br/><br/>so, set it up like this:<br/><br/>'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Status Attributes (NOT Attributes) -&gt; (set it up, see below)<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: ability<br/>(Attribute Type: String Dictionary)<br/>Format String (Attribute Value): Ability: !<br/><br/>the '!' will display the Attribute's Value<br/><br/>so, as of right now, conceptual (and in pseudo-code: I'm lazy) explanation of what it will display:<br/><br/>player.ability = 0 (after you see this all working for you, obviously you don't want this to be showing '0', when in this example, it is actually starting at '15', not '0')<br/>player.ability = player.attunement + player.coordination + player.fighting<br/>player.ability = (5) + (5) + (5)<br/>player.ability = 15<br/><br/>Status Attribute:<br/><br/>ability = Ability: !<br/>ability = Ability: (15)<br/><br/>output (what you'll see in the 'status' box during game play):<br/><br/>Ability: 15<br/><br/>and as your 3 Attributes change, it'll adjust to the new sum of them, for example:<br/><br/>player.attunement = 10<br/>player.coordination = 5<br/>player.fighting = 5<br/><br/>output:<br/><br/>Ability: 20<br/>(10 + 5 + 5)<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-size:150\">oops... forgot this last very important thing... lolololol</span></span><br/><br/>the 'status' box will display this:<br/><br/>Ability: 0<br/><br/>until, you cause it to update, which you can do so by (one way):<br/><br/>just click on the command bar at the bottom during game play, and type in whatever, a simple 'p' will do and hit the 'enter' key on your keyboard, and now it should update to show:<br/><br/>Ability: 15<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>HK edit: err... I forgot you wanted the 'sum of the 3 Attributes divided by 3', hopefully you can know~figure out how to put this into it, if not let me know.<br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>and now hopefully it works fully for you... let me know if it doesn't (I might be missing or messed up something, or you might have messed something up, let me know, and we'll troubleshoot it, so that it works for you)<br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>as for the other 1-2 methods (Commands or the 'popup' menu box), if interested, I'll make a separate post for them, as I'm tired now... lol.",

That way the [Status Attributes] on the right can be updated (since they are update in my TurnScript? [/quote:35u8lpok]\n\nthere might be a way to do so (but as default the 'show menu' choice selection doesn't count as a turn), as 'turns' deals with the internal coding of the quest engine, and while Jay did have a post on the 'order of operations' with how turns work, what counts as 'turns', and etc about turns (somewhere... argh), it was a little bit beyond me, so for this question, you'll need to get help from the good coders here, as I'm not at this understanding yet of how quest's internal coding of its turns, works. They can certainly help you, but on this, I can't help.\n\n---------------\n\n[quote=&quot;reaper666&quot;:35u8lpok]The only hurtles I have left (simply because I haven't got around to them) is making the \n{Points Remaining: X}\nwhen you go into the menu to increase you Attunement, Coordination, Fighting, etc.\n\nThat should just be as simple as making an attribute called (attribute_point_buy) and make a message appear with the menu that is something along the lines of \nmsg (&quot;Points Remaining = (attribute_point_buy)&quot;)\n\nProbably typed it out wrong, but coding is much easier to do than write it out[/quote:35u8lpok]\n\nthis can be simple or complex (see Pixie's Level Library ~ If you can't find where it's at: if it's not in the 'libraries and sample code' forum board, I'll get it for you).\n\na simple way is to just have a (my label~naming only, for an example) 'skill_point_integer' Integer Atribute, which you decrease~subtract, each time you make a selection via the 'show menu', see a simple brief non-extensive code example below:\n\n(using 'show menu' and 'switch' and 'split' for this)\n\nthe 'switch' is just a different design~method for doing multiple 'if' Scripts:\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/switch.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... witch.html</a><!-- m -->\n\nthe 'split' is a very quick way to create a list:\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/string/split.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... split.html</a><!-- m -->\n\n[code:35u8lpok]&lt;function name=&quot;level_up_function&quot;&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;\n  if (player&#46;skill_point_integer &gt; 0) {\n    show menu (&quot;Choose a stat to raise&quot;, split (&quot;attunement;coordination;fighting&quot;, &quot;;&quot;), false) {\n      switch (result) {\n        case (&quot;attunement&quot;) {\n          player&#46;attunement_integer = player&#46;attunement_integer + 1\n          msg (&quot;You've increased your 'attunement' by 1, it's now at {player&#46;attunement_integer}, and you've got {player&#46;skill_point_integer} skill points left&#46;&quot;)\n          level_up_function\n        }\n        case (&quot;coordination&quot;) {\n          player&#46;coordination_integer = player&#46;coordination_integer + 1\n          msg (&quot;You've increased your 'coordination', it's now at {player&#46;coordination_integer}, and you've got {player&#46;skill_point_integer} skill points left&#46;&quot;)\n          level_up_function\n        }\n        case (&quot;fighting&quot;) {\n          player&#46;fighting_integer = player&#46;fighting_integer + 1\n          msg (&quot;You've increased your 'fighting', it's now at {player&#46;fighting_integer}, and you've got {player&#46;skill_point_integer} skill points left&#46;&quot;)\n          level_up_function\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  } else {\n    msg (&quot;You're done leveling up, having spent all of your skill points&#46;&quot;)\n  }\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:35u8lpok]\n\n----------\n\n[quote=&quot;reaper666&quot;:35u8lpok]Now, I thought about trying to do a (String Dictionary) like HK suggested, but making it display into the [Status Attribute] was beciming more of a task than anything - so I made 3 more [Attributes] called: ability_name ; mental_name ; physical_name[/quote:35u8lpok]\n\nI'm not exactly clear on what you did with this, but just about 'statusattribute', see below:\n\nthe 'statusattribute'..

I'm going to try to get to get good at coding... eventually... hopefully to their levels, hehe)<br/><br/>(if you want to see my own progress~struggle with learning to code for my very first time ever: with quest!, I was so overwhelmed just with all of the terms when I started ~ after finishing the tutorial, lol, take a look at this noobie thread of mine: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=3348\">viewtopic.php?t=3348</a><!-- l --> )<br/><br/>(as you learn more about quest's coding, and coding, you'll be able to craft, better ~ more efficient ~ shorter ~ more concise, code, but it's a slow learning process to learn more and more code designs and methods)<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>reaper666 wrote:</cite>The only problem I'm experiencing is that I can't make the 'RESET' option work, aka, setting the stats back to 5 and the points remaining to 45.</blockquote><br/><br/>you literally set them to what you want (if you have~know those specific values, of course ~ if not, than it's more complex code), since they're~you're selecting 'reset', this is all you need for its scripts:<br/><br/>'reset' menu list choice selection's scripts:<br/><br/>game.cc_aspect_points = 45<br/>player.attunement = 5<br/>player.coordination = 5<br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/>----------------<br/><br/>a code trick for 'reverting' is this, for example:<br/><br/>player.strength = 50<br/><br/>before you change an Attribute (player.strength), create a new one and set it to your (unchanged) Attribute's value, via an example:<br/><br/>player.strength_old = player.strength<br/><br/>conceptually: player.strength_old = player.strength = 50<br/>conceptually: player.strength_old = 50<br/><br/>now, we can change our Attribute (player.strength), as normal:<br/><br/>player.strength = player.strength + 25<br/><br/>player.strength = 50 + 25 = 75<br/><br/>now, to revert back to our old value:<br/><br/>player.strength = player.strength_old<br/><br/>player.strength = 50<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>you can do this with~for ANY Attribute Type (Strings, Integers, Doubles, Booleans, Objects, Scripts, Lists, Dictionaries), for example:<br/><br/>room.description = msg (&quot;You find yourself in a dense thick jungle.&quot;)<br/><br/>room.description_old = room.description<br/>conceptually: room.description_old = room.description = msg (&quot;You find yourself in a dense thick jungle.&quot;)<br/>conceptually: room.description_old = msg (&quot;You find yourself in a dense thick jungle.&quot;)<br/><br/>new value (setting):<br/><br/>room.description = msg (&quot;You're in a spooky haunted old house.&quot;)<br/><br/>reverting back to old value:<br/><br/>room.description = room.description_old<br/>conceptually we're back to our old value: room.description = msg (&quot;You find yourself in a dense thick jungle.&quot;)<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>as for your randomness section of your post, if it works for you, awesome!<br/><br/>(I've actually not delved into this type of string concatinating~construction~parsing that you're doing, so you're already coding in this aspect at a higher level than me, hehe)<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>also, you can shorten these parts of your code up:<br/><br/><pre><code>if (result = &quot;&#91;Ability&#93; Attunement&quot;) {<br/>    player&#46;attunement = player&#46;attunement + 1<br/>    game&#46;cc_aspect_points = game&#46;cc_aspect_points - 1<br/>    if (game&#46;cc_aspect_points = - 1) {<br/>      player&#46;attunement = player&#46;attunement - 1<br/>      game&#46;cc_aspect_points = game&#46;cc_aspect_points +1<br/>    }<br/>    else if (player&#46;attunement = 16) {<br/>      player&#46;attunement = player&#46;attunement - 1<br/>      game&#46;cc_aspect_points = game&#46;cc_aspect_points +1<br/>    }<br/>    cc_aspects<br/>  }</code></pre><br/><br/>by doing this structure~design (well actually method~way, whatever) instead:<br/><br/><pre><code>if (result = &quot;&#91;Ability&#93; Attunement&quot;) {<br/>  if (game&#46;cc_aspect_points &gt; 0 and player&#46;attunement &lt;= 15) {<br/>    player&#46;attunement = player&#46;attunement + 1<br/>    game&#46;cc_aspect_points = game&#46;cc_aspect_points + 1<br/>  } else {<br/>    msg (&quot;Sorry, but you've reached your limit&#46;&quot;)<br/>  }<br/>} else if (result = &quot;&#91;Ability&#93; Coordination&quot;) {<br/>  if (game&#46;cc_aspect_points &gt; 0 and player&#46;coordination &lt;= 15) {<br/>    player&#46;coordination = player&#46;coordination + 1<br/>    game&#46;cc_aspect_points = game&#46;cc_aspect_points + 1<br/>  } else {<br/>    msg (&quot;Sorry, but you've reached your limit&#46;&quot;)<br/>  }<br/>}<br/>// etc 'else ifs'<br/>cc_aspects</code></pre><br/><br/>and we can actually shorten this code much more too with even better methods~ways, but they're much more code advanced too.",
