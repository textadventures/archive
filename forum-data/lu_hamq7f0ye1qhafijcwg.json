      "EditableText": "there's actually a lot of resources here, and it's not \"too\" hard to learn how to use scripting (Attributes and the 'if' Script), as I myself found quest and used it to learn to program, from having absolutely zero knowledge on programming (as well as game makiing / designing / developing, lol). Though, if you're completely new to programming/coding/scripting, it'll take some time to grasp/understand scripting, as you got to train your brain in its 'if'-logic usage. The scripting itself is (for the most part) the same between Game Book and Text Adventure, though your means of accessing the scripting is a bit different between them. Here's some links of, mine and others (most of the resources are Pixie's), on doing scripting:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ (the quest doc, resources galore)\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/#Tutorial (the tutorial in the quest doc)\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/games/topic/5940/quest-tutorials-and-templates-published (there's still a big gap between the tutorial and trying to do stuff on your own in trying to make your own game and parts/features/capabilities of it, so XanMag has created a 'tutorial 2' game, to help with the transition from the tutorial to actually doing various stuff on your own that you probably want in your game)\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/ (the 'Elements' are quest's underlying code's OBJECTS of its: Object-Oriented Programming: OOP / Object-Orientied Design: OOD, not to be confused with the user-level 'Object/Page' Element. Some of the other Elements are: Functions, Verbs, Commands, Exits, Turnscripts, Timers, ObjectTypes / Types, and etc. Just know that these 'Elements' are your 'physical things' in quest, your main 'tools/building blocks')\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/types/ (here's the different, Attribute Types / user-level Data Types, in quest)\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/attributes.html (here's even more built-in Attributes too)\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/object.html (here's many of the Attributes of the 'Object' Element)\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/game.html (this is the special 'game' Game Settings Object and its Attributes, which both Text Adventure and Game Book has)\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/ (some of the built-in scripting Scripts/Functions)\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/ (categorical order, the mostly-rest of the Functions)\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/index_allfunctions.html (alphabetical order, same as the above link, just sorted alphabetically instead of categorically)\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/#Howto (more guides/resources)\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples (more resources/guides: libraries and code samples)\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/text_processor.html (the text processor commands are useful and easy, compared to doing scripting the 'normal' way, so use them when you can, but you can always use the 'normal' way of doing scripting too, if you need to in that you can't use text processor commands and/or if in some cases where it's just more complicated to use the text processor commands than using the 'normal' scripting way)\r\n\r\nsome of my resources on scripting (Attributes and the 'if' Script):\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk (scripting: Attributes and the 'if' Script, a detailed guide more oriented to coding but I do tell how to do the stuff in the GUI/Editor too, also this includes some explanation of the concepts of programming and of quest's user-level design/structure, to help in understanding the coding of quest better too)\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/5387/i-really-need-help#37375 (here's a step by step guide/walkthrough on creating your own demo game to teach you the basics of usage of Attributes, including the usage of the 'statusattributes' too)\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5137/list-and-dictionary-extensive-guide-by-hk (List/Dictionary Attributes are a bit more advanced/confusing/difficult/hard to learn than the normal Attributes: Booleans, Strings, Object reference/pointers, Integers/Ints/Non-Decimal Numbers, Doubles/Floats/Floating Points/Decimal Numbers, and Scripts)\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5138/explore-and-travel-code-sample-by-hk (example of moving around without using Exits: you 'search' to first discover more areas, and then you can choose which of those discovered areas to travel/move to and/or back from, using Lists/Dictionaries)\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe Game Book can do scripting, though it doesn't have the full capabilities of the Text Adventure, but you can certainly probably do most if not all (depends on how RPG-scripting-heavy you want your Game Book) of the scripting you need for your Game Book game making plans/ideas/goals.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nin the Game Book, to do (the accessing of the) scripting:\r\n\r\n'NAME_OF_PAGE' Page Object -> 'Page' Tab -> Page Type: [SCRIPT] or [TEXT+SCRIPT]\r\n\r\nthen follow the scripting for Text Adventure (as it's the same for both Text Adventure and Game Book): add new script -> (choose/set-up your Scripts)\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nwhile, my 'Attributes and the 'if' Script' guide/link talks about this (roughly the middle and near the bottom), I'll briefly touch upon it here too:\r\n\r\nAttributes:\r\n\r\nusing currency as an example (as it covers how to increase or decrease Attributes, such as often done with 'stat' Attributes in games: strength, endurance, dexterity, etc etc etc): instead of having individual 'gold/gold-coin (or whatever the name of your currency)' Objects and moving them around, you can just use Attributes and adjust their Values, to produce the same effect of transactions (via adjusting yours and others currency amounts/Values), for example (Text Adventure, let me know, and I'll help with doing this type of stuff in Game Book), for some scripting examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuying:\r\n\r\ninitial states:\r\n\r\nkatana.parent = shop_owner // the 'shop_owner' Object currently contains/has the 'katana' Object\r\nkatana.price = 50 // the price of the 'katana' Object is '50' (the 'price' is an Integer Attribute just as the 'currency' is an Integer Attribute seen below)\r\nplayer.curreny = 100 // the 'player' Player Object's 'currency' Integer Attribute's current Value is '100', you have 100 currency\r\nshop_owner.currency = 100  // the 'shop_owner' Object's 'currency' Integer Attribute's current Value is '100', the 'shop_owner' has 100 currency\r\n\r\nbuying actions/process/scripting:\r\n\r\nif (player.currency >= katana.price) { // unfortunately, we don't want you to be able to buy the katana if you can't afford it (doh! lol)!\r\n  player.currency = player.currency - katana.price // you buy the katana (subtract your currency by the price of the katana)\r\n  shop_owner.currency = shop_owner.currency + katana.price // you buy the katana (add the katana's price to the shop owner, as you pay for it, you buy it)\r\n  katana.parent = player // since you paid for the katana, you obviously want to actually get the katana, lol. The 'player' Player Object now currently contains/has the 'katana' Object\r\n  msg (\"You buy the katana\")\r\n} else {\r\n  msg (\"You can't afford the katana\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n// new/current/resultant states (if you were able to buy the katana):\r\n//\r\n// player.curreny = 50\r\n// shop_owner.currency = 150\r\n// katana.parent = player\r\n// katana.price = 50 // this does not get changed, it's not a new state\r\n\r\n// --------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSelling:\r\n\r\ninitial states:\r\n\r\nkatana.parent = player // the 'player' Player Object currently contains/has the 'katana' Object\r\nkatana.price = 50 // the price of the 'katana' Object is '50' (the 'price' is an Integer Attribute just as the 'currency' is an Integer Attribute seen below)\r\nplayer.curreny = 100 // the 'player' Player Object's 'currency' Integer Attribute's current Value is '100', you have 100 currency\r\nshop_owner.currency = 100  // the 'shop_owner' Object's 'currency' Integer Attribute's current Value is '100', the 'shop_owner' has 100 currency\r\n\r\nselling actions/process/scripting:\r\n\r\nif (shop_owner.currency >= katana.price) { // we don't want to sell the katana to the shop owner if he can't afford it (if he doesn't have enough currency to give to you), lol\r\n  shop_owner.currency = shop_owner.currency - (katana.price / 2) // you sell the katana (subtract shop owner's currency, as usual in rpgs lol, by half the price of the katana, lol)\r\n  player.currency = player.currency + (katana.price / 2) // you sell the katana at half price, as is usual in rpgs lol (add the katana's halved price to the player, as you sold it to the shop owner)\r\n  katana.parent = shop_owner // since you sold for the katana, you unfortunately have to give the katana to the shop owner (doh!), lol. The 'shop_owner' Object now currently contains/has the 'katana' Object\r\n  msg (\"You sold the katana\")\r\n} else {\r\n  msg (\"The shop owner can't afford the katana\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n// new/current/resultant states (if you were able to sell the katana):\r\n//\r\n// player.curreny = 125\r\n// shop_owner.currency = 75\r\n// katana.parent = shop_owner\r\n// katana.price = 50 // this does not get changed, it's not a new state\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nask if you need help with anything and/or have any questions",

Learning from just a basic choose-your-own-adventure  format and working up from there as needed.   I'm building a full, working open world RPG in Gamebook mode, with a fighting pit, gambling games, archery contests, a swath of NPCs with random encounters and conditions that need to be met in each location/on each page, exploring the wilderness, a labyrinth, everything (it's quite a large book, but still) and it's more intuitive to my non-coding mind.\r\n\r\nJust using counters, flags, if has/not seen page and some other frilly features, Gamebook can get A LOT done, with actually knowing less about coding. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAnd of course, correct me if I'm wrong, community!   And also this comes with the caveat that way more of the community knows way more about the text adventure mode. But they always try to help with Gamebook issues.  I've been helped many times over the last couple of years.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nEdit: also adding on that the Text Adventure mode is INSANELY robust, it just takes more experience.  I saw someone on Reddit recently who built a literal full-graphic Space Invaders-style video game just using the Text Adventure mode coding.
