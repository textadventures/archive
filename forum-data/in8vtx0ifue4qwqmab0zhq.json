It is bleeding edge, so it constantly has at least one software update available -- but might have 100 at any given moment. Any single update might break something.  For instance, I get the Inform 7 GUI app (gnome-inform7) running in Arch after something breaks it once a month, every month.  It worked last week.  Updated.  No more Inform 7 GUI.  In Arch's defense, gnome-inform7 has to be installed by the user from source code.  It is not included in any repositories.\r\n\r\n...but, if you go more than thirty days without updating everything in Arch, it might not even boot once you *do* finally update everything.  In Arch's defense, the user is warned about all of this.\r\n\r\nStill, no Linux distribution I've ever used automatically updates anything.  Everything except Arch Linux automatically checks for updates, but then you just get a notification that you should definitely get to updating stuff when you're not busy.\r\n\r\nWindows 10 just takes it upon itself to run updates, and that's my biggest issue with it.
