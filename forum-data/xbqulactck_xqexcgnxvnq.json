      "EditableText": "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I've scanned across the solution to my (minor) 'problem' whilst perusing the documentation, but I'll be [expletive deleted] if I can find it now!\r\n\r\nI want \"you\" to print when referring to the player, but I want randomNPC.name to print if #object2# is not the player.\r\n\r\nThe way I have it set up now: 'you' is the alias for player. I added 'me' to the pov_alt so the parser would still understand that 'me' meant player. Now the parser understands 'you', as well as 'me/myself', as player.\r\n\r\nI'm worried this may cause a problem, but all I can think of is if someone uses 'you' in a command. E.g., upon entering: RALPH, FOLLOW YOU, Ralph begins to follow the player... That doesn't bode well for numerous reasons.\r\n\r\nIs there any easy fix to this?\r\nShould I change this and just write an IF...THEN... with two separate messages? (Sorry to ask. I know it's in the documentation, but I've been scouring through everything for so long, my eyes have grown weary.)\r\n\r\nWhat I'm up to:\r\nI'm merging Followers with PathLib, but I'm changing followers so you can tell an NPC to follow another NPC or yourself. Plus, I'm (planning on) setting it up so that the follower will take the best route to whomever is being followed. This is because the player can go a few places some of the followers can't enter. In this instance, the follower(s) will wait where they are. Then, when the player re-emerges into the 'normal map', the follower(s) will automatically travel, room by room, across the map until they reach their target's location. \r\n(This will also come in handy when the player enters the underground tunnel on, say, the north side of town. The horse can't follow him. The exit of the tunnel leads to the south side of town. The tunnel, a one-room shortcut, allows the player to skip across, let's call it, four rooms. The horse will then adhere to PathLib, moving room by room, turn by turn, towards the player.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Code</summary>\r\n_**New Command**_\r\n\r\n**Command pattern:**\r\n```ask #object1# to follow #object2#;tell #object1# to follow #object2#;#object1#, follow #object2#```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nif (not object2.gender =\"it\") {\r\n  if (HasAttribute(object1, \"shadowing\") and ListContains(object1.shadowing, object2)) {\r\n    msg (\"\"+object1.alias+\" redoubles the effort to follow \"+object2.alias+\".\")\r\n  }\r\n  else if (HasAttribute(object1, \"shadowing\") and not ListContains(object1.shadowing, object2)) {\r\n    delete = ObjectListItem(object1.shadowing, 0)\r\n    msg (\"\"+object1.alias+\" ceases to follow \"+delete.alias+\".\")\r\n    list remove (object1.shadowing, (ObjectListItem(object1.shadowing, 0)))\r\n    list remove (delete.followers, object1)\r\n    msg (\"\"+object1.alias+\" begins to follow \"+object2.alias+\".\")\r\n    if (not HasAttribute(object2, \"followers\")) {\r\n      object2.followers = NewObjectList()\r\n      object1.shadowing = NewObjectList()\r\n    }\r\n    if (not ListContains(object2.followers, object1)) {\r\n      list add (object2.followers, object1)\r\n    }\r\n    if (not ListContains(object1.shadowing, object2)) {\r\n      list add (object1.shadowing, object2)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"\"+object1.alias+\" begins to follow \"+object2.alias+\".\")\r\n    if (not HasAttribute(object2, \"followers\")) {\r\n      object2.followers = NewObjectList()\r\n      object1.shadowing = NewObjectList()\r\n    }\r\n    if (not ListContains(object2.followers, object1)) {\r\n      list add (object2.followers, object1)\r\n    }\r\n    if (not ListContains(object1.shadowing, object2)) {\r\n      list add (object1.shadowing, object2)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (object1.alias+\" can't follow an inanimate object.\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n// I haven't added PathLib in as of yet, but I think that should be fairly simple\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>STDOUT</summary>\r\n\r\n> \\>ralph, follow me\r\nRalph begins to follow you.\r\n\r\n>\\> ralph, follow sally\r\nRalph ceases to follow you.\r\nRalph begins to follow your horse.\r\n\r\n>\\> ralph, follow sally\r\nRalph redoubles the effort to follow your horse.\r\n\r\n> \\>rp, follow you\r\nRalph ceases to follow your horse\r\nRalph begins to follow you.</details>\r\n\r\nIf I were using Inform 7 (not that I'm saying I want to), I could do:\r\n```\r\nInstead of asking something to shadow the player when the player's command includes \"you/yourself\":\r\n    say \"[The noun] can't follow [itself].\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: In this example, [The noun] is capitalizing the Quest equivalent of #object1#, and [itself] will print \"himself\", \"herself\", or \"itself\".\r\n\r\nI'm fairly certain that I read how to do such things in the Quest documentation...\r\n\r\nAnyone happen to have the link saved in their favorites/bookmarks?",
