(Did we break the other thread? Oops!)\r\n\r\nHere's a link to the beginning of this thread, just so it's all neatly tied together:\r\n\r\n[http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/mpz_nqciquyxkj_b_6txnq/how-to-put-variables-in-my-game](http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/mpz_nqciquyxkj_b_6txnq/how-to-put-variables-in-my-game \"The beginning of this thread\")\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat's going on here:\r\n\r\nThis statement is in the Quest syntax. (It might be some other programming language. I don't know. Let's just call it Quest for simplicity's sake.)\r\n\r\n- 'getname' is the name of a page \r\n\r\n- - The page 'getname' is  set up to run a script.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ```command:``` is calling the script for the page following its colon. (In this case, of course, it's 'getname'.)\r\n\r\n-  ```getname``` is the name of the page. In a gamebook, the script will be ran for the page you enter here. (If you were writing a text adventure, this would work a little differently.)\r\n\r\n- ```:``` is leading to the text to be displayed on the link, which is ```Enter your name and continue...``` in this example.\r\n\r\n- The ```{``` opens the statement, and the ```}``` closes it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, you add a page. Then you create a script (or enter the text to be printed) for it. Then you can 'point' to it in your statement.\r\n\r\n>Example:\r\n>\r\n>I add a page and name it 'FOOBAR'.\r\n>\r\n>Now, I want the last page I wrote to link to FOOBAR, so I add this line on the text:\r\n>\r\n>```{command:FOOBAR:This is what the link will say.}```\r\n>\r\n>This leads me to believe that, to assign an attribute (such as HEALTH, WEALTH, or STEALTH), one need simply add a page, then adjust the script for said page accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo, if we take a look at these two pages, we will find most of the functions and script commands available in Quest. The next step is to pick one thing we want to do, and focus on that.:\r\n**NOTE: I'm not sure which ones work or won't work in a gamebook.**\r\n\r\n**Script commands (such as ```get input```, which we use to collect text input from the player)**\r\n[http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/)\r\n\r\n**Functions**\r\n[http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/functions/)\r\n\r\nYou will see how many possibilities you have to choose from after clicking those links. There's really not a short list of easy commands to offer up, but hegemonkhan has gone through great lengths to provide easy to read tutorials, and The Pixie has some VERY DETAILED documentation posted. The hard part when you're new (and I know because I just started using Quest within the past three weeks) is determining the correct terminology to use for what you're trying to accomplish.\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere's a link about attributes:\r\n[http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/custom_attributes.html](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/custom_attributes.html \"Attributes - the easiest way to keep track of HEALTH, WEALTH, STEALTH, and etc.\")\r\n\r\n---\r\n'Anatomy of a Quest game' is full of good information as well:\r\n[http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/anatomy_of_a_quest_game.html](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/anatomy_of_a_quest_game.html)\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlso, I wouldn't be able sleep without pointing this minor typo out:\r\n\r\n```{command:Page2:go to next oage}``` should be ```{command:Page2:go to next page}```\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere's a link to the main page for the documentation:\r\n[http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/)\r\n\r\n---\r\nSomeone else will surely drop in and offer you a totally different perspective, which is great!
