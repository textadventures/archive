Does any one have any experience if how well that works in practice?",

If your collaborator is tasked with writing room descriptions then they don't need to be writing to the file at the same time that you do. They can write it into text documents to be pasted in later. If they need to be working on the file at the same time (from a different computer, perhaps miles apart) as you then you need to ask yourself why. It can get very confusing working that way because you'll keep over writing each other (your latest save will be wiped out by their latest save which hasn't seen your latest update etc) and the solution is to set given roles rather than both doing the same tasks simultaneously.\n\nOr if you must, you work one day and they the next; via dropbox or google drive like jay suggested. Quest isn't like Google Docs and I can't envisage it ever being able to work that way (I'll be proven wrong, no doubt).",
