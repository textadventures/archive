The basic idea is to have a piece of script that you can invoke again from the wrong password case. One way to do that is to put the script into a function so it can re-invoke itself. For example, let's say that you have a command named EpadCommand with pattern &quot;use epad&quot;. It can be set up like this:\n\n[code:30g9p83d]  &lt;command name=&quot;EpadCommand&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;pattern&gt;use epad&lt;/pattern&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;\n      msg (&quot;Enter password&quot;)\n      get input {\n            if (result=&quot;1234&quot;) {\n              MoveObject (player, login)\n            }\n            else {\n                 msg (&quot;Incorrect password&quot;)\n                  do(EpadCommand, &quot;script&quot;)\n            }\n      }\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/command&gt;[/code:30g9p83d]\nThe idea behind this is that if the player enters the wrong password, it tells them so and then simply invokes the same command script again.
