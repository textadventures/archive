      "HTML": "<p>Actually The Pixie taught me... sort of. I used his combat tutorial.</p>\n<p>I adapted an already existing dictionary. And I made new intergers.</p>\n<p>I use the online version.</p>\n<p>Here's what the code looks like. This is in the start script.</p>\n<pre><code>player.alias = \"you\"\nplayer.hitpoints = 110\nplayer.max = 110\nplayer.damage = 3\nplayer.attack = 1\nplayer.defence = 0\nplayer.armour = 0\nplayer.exp = 0\nplayer.level = 0\nplayer.attackers = NewObjectList()\nplayer.ammo = 40\nplayer.potion = 1\nplayer.hyper_potion = 0\nplayer.gold = 0\nplayer.statusattributes = NewStringDictionary()\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"hitpoints\", \"Hit points: !\")\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"ammo\", \"Spare ammo: !\")\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"equippedname\", \"Weapon: !\")\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"ammonote\", \"Ammo: !\")\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"level\", \"level: !\")\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"exp\", \"exp: !\")\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"potion\", \"Potions: !\")\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"hyper_potion\", \"Hyper Potions: !\")\nspade.damage = \"2d5\"\nspade.attack = 3\npistol.damage = 0\npistol.attack = 0\npistol.firearmdamage = \"3d7\"\npistol.firearmattack = 3\npistol.ammo = 7\npistol.ammomax = 6\ngame.notarealturn = false\ndictionary add (player.statusattributes, \"gold\", \"Gold: !\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>At the end it shows the stats in the status pane. Just look at my so-far only published game, The Legend of The Secret of the Smelly, Stinky Fish.</p>\n<p>Blah<br>\nAlso I made an object that the player uses to heal themselves, a \"potion bag.\" Not that you technically need it, but I programmed the game so that the player needed it to progress (locked the first room). Otherwise, you would type in \"Heal potion potion bag\", or \" Heal Hyper potion potion bag.\" I tried using it without the \"#object#\", but for some reason I couldn't get it to work. Maybe I'm just bad at programming, maybe I should have followed The Pixie's example of \"if player is carrying potion bag\"...<br>\nBlah</p>\n\n",
