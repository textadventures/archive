The goal is to make an interactive gameworld as real as fantasy will allow.  It is of the high fantasy/medieval genre with an original world.  The game itself will include a skill-based system rather than an experience based one.  Skills will include general combat skills, as well as craft skills, survival skills, magic skills, lore skills and others.  Skills will be gained through use of the skill instead of 'point allocation'.  Levels will be practically nonexistent except for in the sense that there are 'ranks' within the variety of guilds and you will be able to move up in rank depending upon your skills.  E'tanalesia will not be a senseless hack and slash, kill everything to level up game.  You will be able to choose any possible path for your character, wether it be the slightly overweight baker who runs his own shop, the dairy farmer who spends most of his days with his cows, or of course, the warrior who fights for his king and country.  There will be numerous possibilities.\n\nCurrent Stage of Development:  Alpha 1\n\nSeeking:  Builders and Assistant Coders.\n\nIf you are interested in working on this project, you can contact me at KilarraDR on aim or email me at <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:darkgoddessnight@yahoo.com\">darkgoddessnight@yahoo.com</a><!-- e -->.\n\nThanks,\nTMSC",
