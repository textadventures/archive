      "EditableText": "DavidW raises a good point, but I'll tell you how you could do this anyway. You've got a couple of possible ways:\n\n1. Use the &quot;pause&quot; command to create a script like this:\n\nPrint &quot;Waiting 15 seconds...&quot;;\nPause for &quot;1500&quot; milliseconds;\nGive &quot;ore&quot; to the player\n\n(&quot;Pause&quot; is in the &quot;Other&quot; category and &quot;Give&quot; is in &quot;Inventory&quot;.)\n\n2. Create a timer that has an interval of 15 seconds. In the timer script, give the ore item to the player, and turn off the timer. Set the timer to be initially inactive. Now, in your &quot;use pickaxe on ore&quot; script, activate the timer (using &quot;Turn on a Timer&quot; from the Timers category).\n\nThe second approach has the advantage that the player will be able to do other things while the 15 seconds elapses, though I guess the point of what you're doing is that they're supposedly using their axe for this time, so first approach may fit better. But as DavidW says it will probably be annoying.\n\nYou can use the $rand$ function to generate a random number. You can use this as the parameter of the pause command if you want to wait a random amount of time.",
