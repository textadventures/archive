Quest has always supported either whatever fonts are installed on your computer, or the webfonts from Google, neither of which are bitmap fonts. Bitmap fonts are drawn in an image editor and stored in a sprite sheet to be used for in-game text.\n\nIf a font is no longer available I can only assume either you've removed it from your system or Google removed it from their webfont repository for some reason.",

If you want to use your special font, though, you could use an html document with your font as the first one in the font-family for the body.  Does that help?",
