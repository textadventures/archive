Is it simply the class name for the command input?\n\nI ask because I wonder what other elements could be enabled/disabled at will.\n\nLet's say I wanted to do the same with the game title or room title (I know these can be turned off in the UI, but this turns them off permanently)\n\nCould I, for instance, find the 'keyword' for these elements and create a function.
