      "EditableText": "I am not an expert but I think it means the quest app is trying to execute what you want it to do as per your written code instructions, unfortunately the execution stops because the requirement is suddenly gone, most possibly an object since the very first error line states 'GetDirectChildren(game.pov.parent)'\r\n\r\nMy easier ways are to\r\n1. Make things invisible rather than moving objects away from the room, this means the object is still in the room and will possibly still trigger your written code\r\n2. Slow down the timer of moving objects in and out of the room, giving time for quest app to execute codes seems to help a lot, not just for this error, but for many other errors as well\r\n\r\nMrangel's difficult ways are\r\n1. Freeze internal functions, in quest app bottom left, there is a filter list to open all the internal functions, basically, you disable all the relevant internal function by using a simple if else loop, if you are moving objects, disable all internal functions, else, enable all internal functions\r\n2. Hiding all notification errors at UI Initialisation script:\r\n```\r\nJS.eval(\"$(function(){var t=addText;addText=function(n){n.match(/>Error running script:/)?console.log($(n).text()):t(n)}});\")\r\n```\r\nTo access UI Initialisation script, at game object, tickbox show advanced scripts for the game object, click advanced scripts tab, press code view, copy and paste JS.eval (\"$(function(){var t=addText;addText=function(n){n.match(/>Error running script:/)?console.log($(n).text()):t(n)}});\")\r\n\r\nA common error is that game creators use GUI function to create javascript textbox and copy and paste code, this results in two javascript which basically disable the whole function\r\n3. Optimizing the game coding via dictionary, lets not go into this @.@\r\nBut for anyone that is interested in this long and advanced method which will probably optimize all of your other games as well, you can learn from mrangel at\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/esxx6dguiuoaqrku5b6ihg/fishy-error\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI have combined my fishing game with the same errors as yours with mrangel's 2. Hiding all notification errors at UI Initialisation script\r\nYou can try out the small demostration which works without errors at\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/57zl3sqjdeoeuqwqok9r5q/test\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you are skeptical and think the original game is already without errors, then you can download the original game here\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!--Saved by Quest 5.8.6836.13983-->\r\n<asl version=\"580\">\r\n  <include ref=\"English.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n  <game
