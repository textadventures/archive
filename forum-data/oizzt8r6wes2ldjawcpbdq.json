You basically just send what you would code in JS.  Like, in this one, I passed this when using the thingy: ```w.me.usedThingy = true```.\r\n\r\nIn the first game, the thingy is in the first room (of course).\r\n\r\nIn the second game, the thingy is Nowhere.  On load, a script checks for data, and this one checks for ```w.me.usedThingy``` once the data (if any) is loaded.  So, the second game sees that the player used the thingy from the first game, and it moves the thingy in the second game to the player.  All attributes on the first thingy could be transferred to the second thingy between games.  This game was just a very basic test.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have a room called \"Nowhere\".  In Nowhere, I can place one of each type of object, each with a name reflecting its type (e.g., \"blank_switchable\").   Then, I can pass data between games that will lead to cloning whichever object and setting whatever alias and whatnot.  Should be relatively easy.\r\n\r\nI think the hard part would be actually loading a saved game when jumping between games.  It works like the Glulx games work on this site.  You can have multiple saves in your local storage.  That would make it difficult to code things correctly, I bet.\r\n\r\n...unless Pixie knows of some way to check which saved game is loaded from within the game.  If that could be done, we could easily concoct a data string to pass the information back and forth, I suppose.\r\n\r\n---\r\nGosh, Pertex!  It sure is nice to hear from you!  I reiterate my hope that all is well!",
