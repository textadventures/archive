I tried adding it to a verb of Y, but Quest says it conflicts with the existing command &quot;put&quot; and to use the Container tab to configure container behavior. Well, the container tab only has a spot to put scripts for opening, closing, locking, and unlocking.\n\nUsing the offline interface.\n\nThanks.",
