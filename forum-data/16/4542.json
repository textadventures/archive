Quest has given me an edge and helped me better understand the concepts of making games which was something I've always wanted to do back in the days of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and Star Wars: Pod Racers.  In fact I think my passion for game development started with me wanting to add Pod Racing to Majora's Mask... which I wouldn't have thought up of if it wasn't for the infamously out of place Pod Racing scene in Star Wars The Phantom Menace... if it wasn't for the Phantom Menace...\n\nI want to thank Alex for making such an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand game engine, and Jaynabonne for supporting me.  I will always remember Quest as being the little game engine that did.\n\nSincerely from the United States of America,\n\nSeth &quot;The Entropic Pen&quot; Leonard",
