This has been an ongoing thing, and since pestering is what I do best, as Alex knows from another forum, I thought I might as well pester some more!\n\nIt's very simple, really. It's about the &quot;Latest Games&quot; page. I check that page every day for new games (so I'm not exactly a disinterested complainer), and when it gets updated with +18 games - as I think happened yesterday/today - some of those announcements are lost.\n\nLooking at the date in which those games were actually added - some of them 5 and 7 days ago - it's clear to me that there's a backlog of games that gets updated every once in a while, which is hard to manage. I'm ok with that, it's great that someone actually takes the trouble to do that. I would not ask that that person be given even more stress bu forcing that person to update more often. I just think it'd be the easiest solution - the most sensible solution - to allow for some &quot;previous/next&quot; navigation arrows at the end of the page.\n\nConsider also that the way it's currently done it will hurt some authors. Some games just won't be announced properly. Within this community it probably doesn't matter much, as you have other ways of announcing games amongst yourselves, but textadventures.co.uk clearly aims to be for people outside of this community as well. People like myself. And if I miss a game announcement on the Latest page because it got lost in the noise...\n\n...and sometimes there's quite a volley of new items because someone decides to add a batch of non-Quest games, and I'm specificall thinking about the period when a bunch of Parchment-playable Inform games were added...\n\n...then I will just never get to play that game. And neither will other people.\n\nALTERNATIVELY, the RSS feed was a great workaround to this, but it kept breaking and I'm right in saying that it's not active anymore, right? If that were still up, it'd give me (and everyone else) access to the older &quot;Latest&quot; games and all would be good.",
