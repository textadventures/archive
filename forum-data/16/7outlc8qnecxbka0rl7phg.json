It's where I first learned about text adventures :)\r\n\r\nI recently made a text adventure html game and just today published it so that  I could share it with a friend. This game is absolutely PG and has no adult content at all yet some of the recommendations in the side bar are for \"foot fetish\" games.\r\n\r\nWould you guys be able to make the game recommendations only PG?",
