I can create Squiffy games and they show up on the \"My Games\" page of the \"Create\" section. When I try to create a Quest game, I can get into the editor and make changes, but the game never shows up on the \"My Games\" page. I have tried removing the \"login with Google\" from my profile but that did not fix it. I have tried another computer and another browser, but the problem is still there.\r\n\r\nIf there is not a simple answer to this problem, I would like to delete my account to free up the email address, so I can try creating the account again. Can this be done?",
