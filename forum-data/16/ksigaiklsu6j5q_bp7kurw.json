      "EditableText": "I'm not 100% on the inner-workings, but...\r\n\r\nWhen you use the desktop version of Quest, you can hear your PC ramping up when entering commands that trigger complex scripts.  (This also happens when the desktop editor loads a good-sized game.)\r\n\r\nNow, as far as I can tell, the online server is acting as each online player's PC.  Each time a command is entered, that is sent to the server.  The command then runs through Quest, the scripts run, and the server sends the output back to your browser, which prints the text (adding images, audio, and/or video, if applicable) and then runs any Javascript functions (including changes to display settings and a timeout if there are any scripts running which pause the game for input).\r\n\r\nSo for each person playing a game, for each command they enter, that server is going through the same strain as your PC when using the desktop player, but it's handling a large number (hundreds? thousands?) of commands simultaneously.\r\n\r\n---\r\nDid I get that right?  Please, correct me, if not.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFurthermore...\r\n\r\nIf you go back and read Alex's posts and blogs concerning this, he knew it was a problem as far as people without Windows machines are concerned.\r\n\r\nHe began three projects, each of which compiled games to websites.  This would make it so this site's server's only job would be hosting files.  Also, we could upload our zipped website to our own website (or basically any website on which we could host files).  Every one of these projects were abandoned before completion.\r\n\r\n**QuestKit** is the best of the bunch.  It is available from NPM (or you can get the source code from Git, or you can go to the QuestKit documentation and play with it in ScratchPad).  It will allow you to create a very basic game, which is compiled to a website (or you have other compiling options), but it is a command line program.  You have to code.  It's not any language Quest uses. And a compiled game LACKS MANY FEATURES.\r\n\r\n**QuestJS** would be the bee's knees, if it worked.  This converted your published .quest file to a website.  ...or it was meant to do that.  A few of us pitched in and got it working a little bit, but the recent changes to the TAKE scripts rendered QuestJS useless.   ( I will note that we *did* create a mod of this which will produce a working website, but your game can't include a map, any timeouts, and numerous other things.  I don't recommend QuestJS to anyone any longer, though.  It has a very high failure rate, even when you follow the known \"rules\".)\r\n\r\n**Quest 6** (the worst of the bunch) was intended to work just like the current version of Quest, only it would use the stuff from QuestJS to publish games directly to websites.  The player was intended to handle these websites AND convert old Quest games to websites in order to load them in the player.  If you read about this, it will seem that Alex was excited and making steady progress.  I believe this was true for a while, but it seems that he hit a dead end quite early on.  I've built Quest 6, and it still published a normal .quest file.  The player and the editor were separate.  The editor works just like Quest 5.6, and the player will only successfully run the provided example game, and that's after you install some stuff with NPM and start up a local server.\r\n\r\n---\r\nOnce upon a time (I hope I've got this right!), Alex created Quest as a summer project.  He used the programming language(s) he was learning at the time to build it.  As time progressed, he learned new languages and things, and he integrated them into Quest, building upon what was already there each time.  (Most of the things he included depend on programs and/or features which are only included in Windows, by the way.)  **EDIT: See [this post](#435487c4-baee-47e0-88e5-5427f623c53f) for the actual facts.**\r\n\r\nSo, Quest is a multi-programming-language, multi-human-language, single platform engine, with a GUI which loads in a web browser.  The desktop player has the Chromium web browser embedded into it, and the web editor communicates with your browser via the server.  Nearly every script that runs in the desktop version is passed from the browser, to Quest, to Windows, back to Quest, and back to the browser.  (If using the online version, that would be browser -> server -> Quest -> Windows -> Quest -> server -> browser.)\r\n\r\nDid I get this bit right? Please, correct me, if not.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf I have a point it is this:\r\n\r\nAlex knew that Quest needs to compile to websites for a better experience during online play.  At this time, we have quite a few people contributing to Quest, and at least two of those people are trying to come up with a good way to accomplish this, but Quest is so feature-rich...  It is a daunting task.",

The most valuable thing about Quest for me, is that someone who wants to write a story has an engine that doesn’t immediately intimidate them with complicated code and is pretty intuitive to get started, and you pick up more code as you want to do more complicated things. The server issue is just that, a server issue, it may be exacerbated by the way Quest works, but surely not insurmountable with resources? Or is it? Being able to play online is a huge plus, casual players don’t want to download anything.",
