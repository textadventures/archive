I'm working on my first game using Quest 5.6.1 and I'm wondering if there's any way to use two objects together with doing &quot;Use x with y?&quot;\n\nFor example, in the game I'm writing, I'd like to have the player character insert a CD into a disc drive, but the only way that I've been able to do this is to do &quot;use CD with disc drive&quot; when I'd really prefer to be able to &quot;put CD into disc drive&quot; or &quot;insert CD into disc drive.&quot;\n\nSimilarly, I'd like to be able to &quot;open door with key&quot; rather than &quot;use key with door.&quot;\n\nThis is probably a really easy thing that I'm just missing, but I just can't figure it out. Hopefully someone here can point me in the right direction. Thanks for your help! <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
