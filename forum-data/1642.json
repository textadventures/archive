It was a game where each question was a riddle, and to advance, you had to get the answer exactly right, or else you'd die. I'm not sure if anyone's aware of this.\r\n\r\nOne of the riddles in it was:\r\nTurn us on our backs\r\n    And open up our stomachs\r\n    You will be the wisest of men\r\n    Though at start a lummox.\r\n\r\nThat's about all I can remember. Does anyone have this one, or know where I can get it? I've searched for a long time for it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nlakerguy_ca",
