Obviously the non-packaged game will repeat the audio as intended.  Searched the forum and couldn't find any note on this bug, and was wondering if anyone had some insight on this.\n\nBug happens with both .wav and .mp3 files.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: this also happens with scripts that play audio upon entering a room.  it will play the first time, but if the player leaves and returns, the audio fails to play  <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? -->",
