There is a function called &quot;GetUIOptions&quot; which is used to query things like whether to use the game font, link color, etc. I can only guess that it's returning different values in the web player (both IE and Chrome ignore the link attributes for me, using internal defaults instead).\n\nLooking at the code I had pulled down for Quest, I get the idea that Alex is working on a way to be able to customize whether you use certain attributes, like these color and link styles. Perhaps something has been rolled out in the web player but the defaults aren't set properly (and we have no way to change them). \n\nIf you don't need individual link colors, you can set the global game link color, and that should work. If you do need individual link colors, etc, then you could probably make local copies of the relevant core functions and remove the calls to GetUIOptions so that you always get the colors and effects you want.",
