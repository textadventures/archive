Then, after a little playing around, I worked out how to increase the strength attribute through scripts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't for the life of me work out how to make a script check the attribute. For example, I've got it set so that there's a script that will check if the strength attribute is about 7 on leaving the room, and if it is it will print a brief message.\r\n\r\nHowever I keep on getting this error message \r\n\r\nError running script: Error compiling expression 'player.strength = > 7 ': SyntaxError: Unexpected token \">\"; expected one of \"-\", < INTEGER >, < REAL >, < STRING_LITERAL >, \"True\", \"False\", < HEX_LITERAL >, < CHAR_LITERAL >, \"null\", < DATETIME >, < TIMESPAN >, \"(\", < IDENTIFIER >, \"if\", or \"cast\"Line: 1, Column: 28 \r\n\r\nI'm sure there's just a syntax thing I'm missing out, but any help would be appreciated.",
