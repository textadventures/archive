I give the name of a the first room then I add a bit to the \"You are in...\" sentence and when I start the game it writes down my sentence then it put at the end an \"a\" and the room name and it doesn't fit always to have an \"a\" there, but I don't know how to change it or remove it.  I checked out some games here and I didn't see it so I take it, it can be removed or changed.\r\n",
