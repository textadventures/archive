I've just started using Quest to make a text adventure, and one thing I've noticed while checking out a few of the ones other people have made, is all the text adventures, appearance wise, all look pretty similar, while the gamebooks often have flashy stylesheets, among other things.\r\n\r\nIs this a gamebook-only feature, or can I make my text adventure look pretty, too? I'd rather not have Times New Roman on a white background when I host my game.",

Going through these options will allow you to quickly change up the basic look of your game: margins, fonts, colors. This is a good place to start with Quest's built-in functionality. I know there are ways to hard code CSS into your game as well, but that will be for someone above my paygrade to explain.",
