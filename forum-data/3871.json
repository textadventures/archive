I am still struggling on the attribute thing because I don't think it is supported by the online version, and alas` I am using an apple computer... soo I have an understanding of attributes but I am not able to implement it... <!-- s:x --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" /><!-- s:x -->[/quote:280u56do]\n\nI was shocked just now to see that the web editor doesn't support editing attributes. Given how fundamental they are to Quest, that was a bit of a surprise. So my posting wasn't useful for you.\n\nHaving said that, I tried adding a &quot;kick&quot; verb to an object - select the object (e.g. &quot;table&quot;) and go to &quot;Verbs&quot; for that object and add the verb and its handling there - and it worked. Since I believe you said that didn't work for you, I'm curious what happened. Can you give any more details? You do need to use the actual verb word you want (e.g. &quot;kick&quot;).",

I didn't know the Verb scripting myself in code form, so you can have the &lt;pattern&gt;&lt;/pattern&gt; for a Verb too, as you can have with a Command (thus allowing for you to be able to type in the verb during game play, hopefully, hehe). I should have looked at the Verb (Element) wiki page more closely, at its attributes, lol. As I didn't know it had the &lt;pattern&gt; attribute. And I presume (if I understand correctly) that the &lt;property&gt; attribute is what connects the Verb's script to the Object's Verb attribute script.[/quote:qi58bh2s]\n\nI don't know about the Wiki; I just created a verb. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> But yes, you provide a pattern to be matched for a verb as with a command. In a way, a verb is a specialized form of command - the hard-coded script for that &quot;verby command&quot; just uses the specified object attribute as its standard action instead of one you provide directly as a script yourself.
