The code you posted doesn't include any curly braces, so this portion of your game must not be the source of the error.  If you look through your code, you'll discover that where certain blocks of code exist, there will be curly braces (an open-brace followed by a close-brace).  See how they portion off if-then statements with more than one &quot;then&quot; statement?  Consider the braces as a logical way to section off these blocks of code.  So each open-brace needs a close-brace.  If you have an unbalanced quantity of open or close braces, then Quest will find error when trying to read your code.  Makes sense doesn't it?",
