If you look at the image on the page you linked to, the &quot;If&quot; statement is indented, so the &quot;If&quot; is under the ^, showing that it belongs to the &quot;Get input&quot;. When adding scripts to the &quot;Get input&quot; itself, you need to click the indented &quot;Add new script&quot; button.\n\nIf that does not work, could you either upload your game or paste the code here so we can see it properly?",

      "EditableText": "Not sure if this would work for you, but I made two commands in the room with my keypad.  One command when entering the correct code was something like 'type 12345' that ran a script opening the door and another command for the wrong code was 'type #text#' followed by my wrong answer script.  Of course you'll need to prompt the gamer with text on how to write the correct response.  I think I had a response to the 'use keypad' command that said something like, if you think the code is 12345, then just &lt;i&gt;type 12345&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nIf those commands are incorrect, I'll edit this when I get home.  Good luck!",
