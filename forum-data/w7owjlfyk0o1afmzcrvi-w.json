Make the layout of the village with building interiors.\r\n2. Add descriptions. \r\n3. Add objects to fill the locations. \r\n4. Add NPCs.\r\n5. Give more life to NPCs instead of standing around all day. \r\n6. Make a day and night cycle. \r\n7. Make weather. \r\n8. Make seasons. \r\n9. Make attributes for player and npc health, hunger, thirst, warmth, fatigue, sanity, infant, and honor. \r\n10. Add narrative and quests through the world. \r\n\r\nThis is all a huge task and all of it I see being accomplished over a long period of time. \r\n\r\nI wanted to present my idea here to see if anyone had tips and advice for me. \r\n\r\nThe main focus is to accomplish all goals within the village and then I can add to the world more easily since the mechanics will be made.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time. \r\n",

      "EditableText": "As a writer and game master (Dungeon Master for you DnD fans), I highly, highly recommend using or developing some sort of randomization tool to flesh out the interiors of your village.  You already know why - it's going to take you nearly forever to create all that detail.  I have seen too many people go through all that effort to recreate the setting that they imagine so clearly, only to burn out and abandon their project.\r\n\r\nOnce you figure out how to randomize all the little details, you can apply the same technique to creating the rest of your world.  In my day, we did it on paper, with simple lists and a roll of the dice.  With computers, it harder because the presentation needs to adapt to that which is being presented.  To avoid that, keep things simple.  Use presentation text like, \"You see: <variable>\" rather than more specific ones like, \"You see a/an <variable>\".\r\n\r\n~Good luck!",
