You can take the ring but can only move the plank.  Once the plank is moved, it should reveal the box.  The box, of course, is a container that holds a coin.\nThe problem is, Quest shows 'There is a [b:1v6m25z8]ring[/b:1v6m25z8], a [b:1v6m25z8]plank [/b:1v6m25z8]and a [b:1v6m25z8]box [/b:1v6m25z8]here'.  I don't want the box to be seen yet but it still shows it even though I have checked the 'make unavailable' box.\nIn this situation, if you say 'look at box' it says 'I can't see that anywhere' even though it's in the description of the room.  It does, however, hide it from the display box on the right.\nLastly, I marked the plank to run a script to show a message saying the plank has been moved and then make the unaccessable box accessable.

'If <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">plank moved</span> flag is on, then say \"The plank has already been moved\", else \"You move the plank revealing a box\", increment one point to 'score', make box accessible.'<br/><br/>I'm still working with the other situation which will be temporarily solved by Al's suggestion of moving the box in from an inventory room when the plank is moved.<br/><br/>Right now it shows...

Using QDK's Interactions pane, select the object (plank in this case)  click 'edit properties and actions' select the actions sub pane and then add an action calling it 'take'.  This action will then be used by typelib rather than the default 'take action' typelib provides, so you put your script here.\n\nIf you load the code I gave above into QDK, this is where you'll find those take actions are set up.\n\n[quote:3qr1v23u]The code you presented worked like a charm in regards to opening the box and getting the coin.

Which I take to mean in this example, I would type \"take or move plank\" and a script is assigned to the command and not the plank? <br/>I sort of understand where you were going with that suggestion but I just am not certain where in QDK you are suggesting to enter the script. </p></blockquote><br/><br/>No, not in the room/game properties! - that's not what I mean <!-- s:-) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:-) --><br/><br/>What you need to do add a take action to the OBJECT ITSELF. Using QDK's Interactions pane, select the object (plank in this case)  click 'edit properties and actions' select the actions sub pane and then add an action calling it 'take'.  This action will then be used by typelib rather than the default 'take action' typelib provides, so you put your script here.<br/><br/>If you load the code I gave above into QDK, this is where you'll find those take actions are set up.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>The code you presented worked like a charm in regards to opening the box and getting the coin.
