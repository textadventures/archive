However, despite the word being in front of you, it still takes some imagination to choose the right words to get the correct outcomes for the situations faced. I enjoyed playing it and it could be a way to introduce someone to a full-blown parser game as it teaches you to read everything first before rushing in - especially in the later stages.",
