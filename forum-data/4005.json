Ideally, I'd like to be able to put a book in a space on the shelf and have it unlock a door, but I can't get it to say anything but &quot;done&quot; when I say something like &quot;put book in gap&quot;. I tried using the expression &quot;^put (?&lt;object&gt;.*) (on|in) (?&lt;object2&gt;.*)$|^put (?&lt;object&gt;.*)$&quot; that I found on one of the other forums as a regular expression instead of a command pattern, but it still won't allow me to &quot;put book in gap&quot;; it just says &quot;that doesn't work&quot;. Any suggestions?",
