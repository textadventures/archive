I will continue to post more of my questions here as they come.\r\n\r\n#1) I understand labeling sections/passages and connecting the choices, but is it possible to connect a choice to a passage, but alter the displayed text? For example, if I have a passage, \"[[scene 2]]:\" I would implement a choice called \"[[scene 2]]\" to go to it, but what if I wanted the choice to read: \"Go to Scene 2.\" Is this possible? This would also be nice so I can have multiple choices throughout the game with the same text.\r\n\r\n#2) Is it possible to skip to a passage or to a scene without having the player click a link? For instance, if I have a minor choice like: \"[[Look behind you.]]\" and then the passage reads, \"[[Nothing's there.]]\" Is the only way to continue the story to have the player click a continue link?",
