      "EditableText": "I've been holding in most of my questions, and I've found most of the answers. I can't figure out how ZILF knows if a word is a noun, verb, preposition, or direction when just using ```<SYNONYM>```.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we can look at lines 8 - 43 in the H2G2 SYNTAX.ZIL file.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/KVonGit/hitchhikersguide-gold/blob/master/syntax.zil#L8-L43\r\n\r\nLines 8 through 11:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<SYNONYM ALL EVERYTHING>\r\n<SYNONYM AGAIN G>\r\n<SYNONYM OOPS O>\r\n<SYNONYM TO TOWARD TOWARDS>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat seems to be NOUN, VERB, VERB, PREPOSITION, with no rhyme or reason. How does ZILF know which is which?\r\n\r\nLet's jump ahead a few lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<SYNTAX SUPER = V-SUPERBRIEF>\r\n<SYNONYM SUPER SUPERBRIEF>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, I assume that ```<SYNTAX>``` sets up ```W?SUPER``` as a verb. Then, I also assume that ```<SYNONYM>``` checks whether the first word (here being \"SUPER\") is already set up (a la ```W?SUPER```). If it is set up, I proceed to assume that ```<SYNONYM>``` then sets each word in this instance up as verbs to match the first word in the group.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I can see how a ```SYNONYM``` block of code within an ```OBJECT``` block of code is easily recognized as a noun. (And adjectives are a no-brainer  (I think).)\r\n\r\nBut I seriously wonder how ZILF knows what type of words it is dealing with in a ```SYNONYM``` block when the first word isn't already declared?\r\n\r\nWait, wait, wait. . .\r\n\r\nThe buzz words are declared first in that file. So, I see how that part works.\r\n\r\nIf the prepositions are declared somewhere outside of the game files, then that makes sense, too.\r\n\r\nThe primary direction words are also probably set up somewhere outside of the game files. So, that's probably how ZILF has something to check against there.\r\n\r\nHmm. I may have answered my own question while typing this. . .\r\n\r\nDid I get it right in the end? BUZZ, PREPOSITIONS, and DIRECTIONS all have the \"main\" word declared before any synonyms are created in the game file? And anything \"wild\" is created as a verb?\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlso, is there a ZILF forum I should be using to ask things such as this?",
