If it's unticked at startup, it sends the javascript to disable underlining.

This code should be put in the UI Initialisation script, but Gamebook mode doesn't have that for some reason.\r\nTo disable hyperlinks permanently in gamebook (so that they don't reappear when loading a saved game), you'd have to override one of the built-in functions and add a line to it:\r\n<pre><code>  &lt;function name=\"InitInterface\">\r\n    if (game.setcustomwidth) {\r\n      JS.setGameWidth(game.customwidth)\r\n    }\r\n    if (not game.showborder) {\r\n      JS.hideBorder()\r\n    }\r\n    if (game.setcustompadding) {\r\n      JS.setGamePadding(game.custompaddingtop, game.custompaddingbottom, game.custompaddingleft, game.custompaddingright)\r\n    }\r\n    SetBackgroundColour(game.defaultbackground)\r\n    SetForegroundColour(game.defaultforeground)\r\n    SetLinkForegroundColour(game.defaultlinkforeground)\r\n    JS.SetMenuBackground(game.menubackground)\r\n    JS.SetMenuForeground(game.menuforeground)\r\n    JS.SetMenuHoverBackground(game.menuhoverbackground)\r\n    JS.SetMenuHoverForeground(game.menuhoverforeground)\r\n    JS.SetMenuFontName(game.menufont)\r\n    JS.SetMenuFontSize(game.menufontsize + \"pt\")\r\n    JS.panesVisible(false)\r\n    JS.uiHide(\"#location\")\r\n    JS.uiHide(\"#txtCommandDiv\")\r\n    <b style=\"color:green\">JS.TurnOffHyperlinksunderline()</b>\r\n  &lt;/function>\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n(My earlier post was based on the assumption that you wanted to create a hyperlink without underlining, but leave the rest of the game links underlined.
