Its like HK said the Library has to be in game file the have to add code, the last part got to me as I don't mess around a whole lot in code but know things would be some much easier if I did lol. And Pixie wow thanks for the reveal but you need not worry from me I don't think I'll be messing with it seems a little more advanced then just create room and create exit lmao. It would be perfect to generate a island but I can manually generate it even though its so tedious mostly connecting the exits, but anyway thanks again to both of you man where would quest help be without you both.\r\n\r\nMike",
