The text-based version is to get my thoughts together on what the player will be able to do and the over-all flow of the paths the player will be able to choose. I know what I generally want each path to be like, but I need help on how to make it work with this program. One major problem is character selection. How do I work that into a text-adventure game? Also, I want to make the score the progress that the player has made with whomever they pursue. Is there a way to make a \"progress score\" for each individual character? Or is there a way I could make it impossible to pursue a character and then pursue another? If anyone could help out that would be great and I thank you greatly in advance.",
