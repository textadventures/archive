Rather than trying to make an epic tale, I decided to create a room escape game with an emphasis on multiple endings (there are 9 ways to finish the game + game over if you run out of time) and rather dark humor. Any constructive criticism (whenever it is about the game or the language as I am Czech) is welcomed.\n\n[quote:1uum3d31]\nStory\nLast math test made students very angry. In fact they are so angry they are about to break into your office and rip you a new one. Yes, you are a math teacher and you are about to die! You must act quickly. You do not have much time to escape...or solve it differently.[/quote:1uum3d31]\n\n[url:1uum3d31]http&#58;//textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/games/view/v4k-jzocpe6xn8apr4q1ra/i-am-a-math-teacher-and-i-am-about-to-die[/url:1uum3d31]",
