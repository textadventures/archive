      "EditableText": "That would depend if you're using ConversationLib or a similar library; or the built-in \"speak to\" or \"talk to\" commands.\r\n\r\nI would suggest having a couple of boolean attributes (flags) on the NPC to keep track of which actions you've done. Then your talk to or speak to script will check those flags with a couple of if statements, and use that to decide which thing he says.\r\n\r\nAs far as giving him the chicken goes, do you want the player character to automatically give it to him if you talk to him when you've got the chicken? Or would you rather use the \"give\" command? In the latter case, you'd use the \"Give\" feature on the chicken, and have the script there check the NPC's flag to see if he's asked for it.",
