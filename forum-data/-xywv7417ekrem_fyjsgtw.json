Is that because I'm moving the spells into the room in the first place and it's getting moved to \"spells_known\" after, or is something else causing the problem, or is this function not working properly?\r\n\r\n<b><i>tl;dr</b></i> How do I force a player to click all previous options before giving them a new option/exit?
