      "EditableText": "So I am beginning the construction of a new combat system for my ongoing work towards a Multiplayer Game Core(which if the combat system comes along as quickly as it should, could have a release soon). I have decided that the combat system will be quite an endeavor, and be both incredibly advanced and simplistic enough for anyone to play.\n\nThe simple aspect of the combat system will be in the form of commands such as: \n'engage #monster#' \n'advance' \n'retreat' \n'disengage' \n'attack #monster#' \n'kill #monster#'\nas well as a logical targeting aspect allowing you to 'attack #monster#' then simply typing 'attack' again to attempt to strike the same target(if it is around and alive).\n\nThese simplified commands can be used by the novice player, and will randomly attack with the currently wielded/readied equipment in one of the equipments attack types(slashing, piercing, bashing, etc.) to a randomly chosen location on the targets body. Moreover, the player can choose to 'aim' for a particular part of a creature at any time before or during combat, then use the simple combat commands to direct their attacks towards that location.\n\nRanged, pole-arm and melee weapons all have different degrees of usefullness/effectiveness thanks to the flexible engagement system and can be used in conjunction with the retreat/advance commands to keep you a safe distance from attacks, close in for the kill, stun or kill enemies from hiding, raise magical shields to ward off physical/magical attacks, snipe them from a distance or incapacitate them long enough to escape. With a multitude of class/guild/societal skills, magic object(elemental bolts, balls, storms etc) manipulation, combat will be more involving than any online text game engine before.\n\nOn the advanced side of the combat system(which can be used seamlessly with the simple system) you must understand the different attack techniques associated with your equipment/fighting style and control your balance while executing them. Understanding how your attacks will effect your enemy, how to target a potential weakness and use your weapon to exploit it or possibly expose a new weakness. This leads to risking higher roundtimes to string together and create your own combonations and fighting techniques/tricks to use and be most effective during combat with whatever foe.\n\nInstead of simply typing 'attack #monster#' using the advanced aspects of the combat system, players can specify the type of attack to execute with their equipped weapon(if weapon is capable of the specified attack). Further players can target specific locations and body parts of enemies to direct their attack at. \n\nThe logical targeting system works in this respect too and shines even more in this area as players can type 'hack left leg' direct a powerful, unbalancing(both offensively and defensively) swing to the target's left leg, knocking it off balance as well as to a kneeling or fallen position, then use a 'slash right' or 'slash right arm' command to direct an attack at the targets off balance side. Enemy position and balance modify the difficulty associated with hitting specific body parts as well as the balance outcome of the attacker. An expert player, well trained in combat manuevers and experiences with slashing attacks could easily disable a foe with one blow and follow up with a powerful beheading attack, ending the conflict.\n\nThis is where I would like some input on the ideas I've presented for a combat system. I know a few people will say it doesn't sound possible with questnet right now, but I assure you, with my current progress, it is possible and on it's way.\n\nSo please, answer the poll and please if you would express any ideas, views or questions on the proposed system or on what seem like difficult aspects of the combat system to use or get used to.",
