I finally worked out how to start a topic and also how to hide it after it has been seen, so it wont show it again.  For obvious reasons I would not want to say “good morning” more than once and do the whole sequence of events as shown below again.  However, I am not sure how to do a regular Conversation Topic nor even a Greeting Script, which the latter would be the “good morning” circle of events to begin with.\n\nNow I can have both “good morning” and “where is father” Starter Conversation Topics and they both work, but “where is father” I want as just a regular Conversation Topic.  At present all that occurs when used as a Conversation Topic, is that-\n\n&quot;&gt; speak to mother\nYou don't really have anything to say to mother right now.&quot;, which is quite the opposite of what I want.\n\nHow do I go about fixing this?  In other words I want it to pop up after the “good morning” one is clicked and gone for the rest of the game.  I have tried to follow the directions as close as possible, but I am just not getting it, although last night I could not even get this far...  I even tried to download the sample ConvDemo.aslx and then run it in Quest as a separate game, but it gives me error messages... perhaps not compatible with the newest update of Quest?\n\nAnd I think I am stuck at- “By default topic will disappear after the player has seen them. To stop that, untick the &quot;Automatically hide after showing&quot; box. You can have new topics appear in the menu after the player has seen this one.

I put the dialouge haphazardly just to get it going.  I am getting the same responses now, as I had before I added it this time.  (I was trying to mimic that demo to my game as closely as possible.)  I do not know the purpose of even having a Greeting Script if it wont start automatically at the start of the game or when you come into a room. (I start the game in that room with mother for my convenience as a tester, but come out and go back in with no greeting dialog...) I mean my original greeting, which is the second part of my dialog seems sufficient enough, but that is considered a Starter Conversation Topics.   <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? -->   And I still can not get the Conversation Topic to work.  Any suggestions?  And now I think I remember why my game stalled and why I stopped making it back then...   Nothing that has to do with Quest or the community, just my lack of reasoning or following clear directions I guess...  <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? -->  Also I do not see anything remotely in my game code (And not just the snippet I gave you.) that shows what is at the bottom of the demo version.\n\n&lt;steps type=&quot;list&quot;&gt;\n      talk to philippa\n      menu:Key\n      talk to philippa\n      menu:Key\n      talk to philippa\n      menu:Key\n      get key\n      talk to philippa\n      menu:Lock\n      speak to mary\n      menu:Herself\n      speak to mary\n      speak to boris\n      menu:Himself\n      speak to boris\n      menu:Dock cranes\n      speak to boris\n      menu:Cranes\n      speak to boris\n      menu:Cranes\n      speak to boris\n      menu:Cranes\n      speak to mary\n      menu:Dock cranes\n      break teapot\n      speak to mary\n      menu:Broken teapot\n      break teapot\n      speak to mary\n    &lt;/steps&gt;\n  &lt;/walkthrough&gt;\n\nI would assume I would see &quot;Mother&quot; some where at the bottom of my own code, with maybe &quot;speak to Mother&quot; or &lt;/steps&gt;, but I do not.\n\nAnd Jay, I am slowly, but surely looking at your library/thread, but the more I look, the more code I see and well... yea...   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",

I put the dialouge haphazardly just to get it going.  I am getting the same responses now, as I had before I added it this time.  (I was trying to mimic that demo to my game as closely as possible.)  I do not know the purpose of even having a Greeting Script if it wont start automatically at the start of the game or when you come into a room. (I start the game in that room with mother for my convenience as a tester, but come out and go back in with no greeting dialog...) I mean my original greeting, which is the second part of my dialog seems sufficient enough, but that is considered a Starter Conversation Topics.   <!-- s:? --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /><!-- s:? -->   And I still can not get the Conversation Topic to work.

However, as I had also mentioned in my first post near the bottom, I would like something a little more simplier like you would find in old RPGs.  Speaking to someone may give a first time message and then a message after that, both of which I know how to do.  The second message will keep repeating, while the first will not.  However, let's say Mother wants you to find your father.\n\n- intial greeting - &quot;Good morning Dear.&quot;, your mother asks.  &quot;How did you sleep?&quot;\n- &quot;Go find your father&quot;\n- &quot;Go find your father&quot;\n- &quot;Go find your father&quot;\n- etc.\n\nYou found your father and initial greeting - &quot;Good morning Pumpkin.&quot;, your father says as he pats you on the head.\n- &quot;Go find your mother&quot;\n- &quot;Go find your mother&quot;\n- &quot;Go find your mother&quot;\n- etc.\n\nSo after speaking to him you go to your mother again and now the conversation automatically changes.\n- &quot;How is your father anyway?&quot;\nand it just goes on from there.\n\nI figured I could make an object called &quot;gift&quot; in which your father would ask you to give to your mother on his behalf, and when you have the object &quot;gift&quot; in your inventory, that could be set as a trigger to make your mother say something different and or after it was given to her.  But how could I simply talk to father and that alone be enough to trigger a new response from mother?  Remember I am no longer using the multiple choice menus, this is strictly old school RPG style now and of course would have to be done with the GUI and not in code.  And course the conversations would be more indepth, I am just putting something simple at the moment.  Thanks.",
