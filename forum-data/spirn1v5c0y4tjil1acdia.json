      "EditableText": "The easiest way to make them into a dictionary is using `QuickParams`, which makes a dictionary quickly. I think it was designed for doing stuff like this.\r\n\r\nIf `Allies` and `Enemies` are the names of variables, then the expression `QuickParams (\"Allies\", Allies, \"Enemies\", Enemies)` will give you a dictionary containing those values. (The names in quotes are the names the variables will have if you pass this dictionary to `do`, `invoke`, or `eval`. The second copy of each is the name of the variable in this function)\r\n\r\nMost of the time, when you use QuickParams, you'll be doing something like this:\r\n```\r\ndo (somecharacter, \"doattack\", QuickParams (\"weapon\", object1, \"target\", object2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think QuickParams can be used for up to 3 values. If you want more than 3, you would have to do something like:\r\n```\r\nparams = NewDictionary()\r\ndictionary add (params, \"Allies\", Allies)\r\ndictionary add (params, \"Enemies\", Enemies)\r\ndictionary add (params, \"Fruits\", Fruits)\r\ndictionary add (params, \"Vegetables\", Vegetables)\r\ndo (someobject, \"somescript\", params)\r\n```\r\n(Edit: QuickParams works for 3 variables. I thought it was 4)",
