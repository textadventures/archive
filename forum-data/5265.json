Been working on a game for almost two months now.\n\nI've already gotten some random messages to appear in my game but now I need to do it in a different way. I'm trying to add roughly over 500 messages, so the player doesn't get tired reading the same messages over and over again.\n\nI tried adding an &quot;if&quot; statement with a random chance but since I added to many messages, Quest froze every time I tried going to that tab. I fixed that now.\n\nIs there another way for creating random messages to appear and how to do that please. I'm a noob with code and can't read it to save my life.\n\nI think I need to add these random messages to &quot;timers&quot; though I'm not sure how to set a random chance without using the &quot;if&quot; statement.\n\nI did check if this topic was posted before but couldn't find it.\n\nIf you need me to explain more, Let me know and thanks.",
