Better coders than you there may be but usually the more advanced people are in a topic the less they are able to understand the difficulties of beginners and their explanations are difficult or impossible to follow. I'm sure (from what I can see) that you are in fact a good coder, Nevertheless you have just made a number of things much clearer to my now ancient brain ! For which many thanks !",
