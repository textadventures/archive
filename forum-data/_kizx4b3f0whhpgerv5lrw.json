I was wondering how one would go about doing something like that. ex:\r\nA goblin is cloned and sent to fight the player, in it's look description it can be called on of these {short:tall:fat:gross:etc}\r\nand when one is picked, it sticks as the monsters attribute, even when another clone is created. I know theres the method with text processing, but that breaks down for me after I try to use more than one random element. Is there a way to do this with attributes and variables? I do most of my work out of the GUI.",
