      "EditableText": "A timer simply &quot;ticks&quot; regularly - it doesn't &quot;count up&quot; by itself. To make a timer count up, you need increase the value of an attribute each time it ticks.\n\nFor example, in the timer script, use the &quot;set a variable or attribute&quot; to set &quot;game.my_timer_count = game.my_timer_count + 1&quot;.\n\nHowever, there are probably easier ways of doing what you want to achieve. Instead of using a timer at all, you can probably use &quot;Run script after a number of seconds&quot;. So you could run one script after 5 seconds, and another script after 10 seconds.\n\nHope that makes sense - if you let us know exactly what you're trying to do I can give you more specific advice.",
