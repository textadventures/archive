After some trial and error I managed to implement the code to my work in progress.I hadn't even noticed that object lists existed before this just string lists.<br/><br/>I did know about the Quest 'Code Bible'. It's useful, but I wasn't sure what I was looking for or how to put it in action.<br/><br/>Thanks also to Silver for the suggestion, I actually considered it as a solution before posting, but I wanted a more dynamic system, in case I want to move the enemy objects around.",
