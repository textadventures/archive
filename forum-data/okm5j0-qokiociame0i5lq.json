      "EditableText": "Hi, everyone! I'm super, super new at Quest (like, I've been doing this a week), so I apologize if this question is incredibly simple. I'm using the browser version of Quest, and have barely ventured into the code view—I'm mostly sticking with the drop-down menu stuff for now.\r\n\r\nMy question is about making objects wearable. I've already checked the \"Wearable\" box in the Features tab of my objects (dark gray uniform and light gray uniform), and I've put them in the same wear slot so that only one can be worn at one time—all of that's working great. The problem comes when I want to, for instance:\r\n\r\n1. Allow the player to pass through a door only if they're wearing the dark gray uniform, or\r\n2. Change the command \"look at self\" text depending on what the player is wearing. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there isn't a drop-down option in the \"If\" script that allows me to select \"If player is wearing object.\" I also considered using object flags to get around this (when player puts on a uniform, set flag \"dark gray worn\" or something like that), but there also doesn't seem to be a place on the Wearable menu to run any scripts—it's all done automatically by Quest.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any idea if I can do this using just the browser version? Please let me know! And thank you.  ",
