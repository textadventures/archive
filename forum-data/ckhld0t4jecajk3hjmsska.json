Since creating a gamebook is seemingly easier I have 2 questions regarding adding things from text adventures into a gamebook:\r\n\r\n1. Is it possible to link pages in text adventures similarly to a gamebook?\r\n2. Can I add money, health and score into a gamebook?\r\n\r\nAnything helps, thank you!",
