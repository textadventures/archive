There was no example of how to use css in the msg function. So it took a little time to work it out. This is what worked for me:  \r\n <code>   msg(‘string to show’,{},’cssClassUsed’)</code>\r\n\r\n2. Is it possible to set the visibility of items? I have a remote that is under some cushions and I don’t want it to show up in the pane until the player moves the cushions.\r\n\r\n3. I have a prolog in the game and I would like to hide the compass and other panes until it finishes. Is that possible?\r\n\r\n4. I am moving the player from one room to another with “moveChar” it moves him, but the panes are not being updated. Ex. The compass continues to show the exits for the room moved from until I exit to another room. (This was actually an attempt to deal with not being able to hide the panes - the user starts in a blank room and is programmatically moved to the actual starting point after the prolog.)\r\n\r\nThanks for all your efforts!\r\n",
