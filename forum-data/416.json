      "EditableText": "This question is mostly for Alex but if any one else knows the answer then great. QDK cost money to use but you are given a standard 30 day trail to evaluate it. My question is this: What if you do not use the QDK? If you code everything, say, using TextPad then after 30 days do you still have to pay for QDK or stop making games for it? If you code everything by hand are you allowed to still make games for QDK without buying the visual editor? I'm just wondering. Because if someone did everything by hand would it be fair for them to buy the QDK even if they didn't use it? Maybe for hand coders you could work something out. Maybe offer a compiler for them at a set price? If not then I will still buy the full thing no matter what, as soon as I can manage to save up a little petty cash to buy it, that is. Any information would be helpful.",
