I've been working on my game for a while now, occasionally posting questions here on the forums, and I'm now happy to say that my game Demo is essentially finished!  However, this is not a game announcement (I'll be putting that in the appropriate forum).  There is one final issue that I need to ask the experts here to help me with.\n\nI am using a conversation menu approach to some parts of my game.  This is achieved by storing dialogue options in a String Dictionary.  This dictionary is then displayed using Show Menu.  After the player picks an option, the menu disappears and the appropriate response is selected from a Switch.  However, there seems to be an issue with this approach when played online.\n\nWhen a player chooses an option, it takes up to a few seconds to load the new response.  In that time, if the player clicks again or on a different option, it produces and error.  First it will say:  &quot;You've already talked about that.&quot; (My Default on the Switch) and then if clicked again this error appears: &quot;Error running script&#058; Unexpected menu response.&quot;  The only way that I've been able to overcome this is by informing my players to wait a few seconds after clicking to prevent this, but that seems a seriously cumbersome way to handle it.  \n\nIf you would like to see the error in action, play my game found here:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://play.textadventures.co.uk/Play.aspx?id=fkht_43vweuiy2bxeakxdg\">http://play.textadventures.co.uk/Play.a ... y2bxeakxdg</a><!-- m -->\nTo get to a conversation, click PLAY, go to the Living Room, and open the Door.  Then you'll be in a conversation with the character Danyel.  Try to click more than once on an option in quick succession to produce the error.  The error can be potentially overcome by clicking on the Look button at the top.\n\nThank you so much for your help in advance!\n\nThe following is the code for this particular conversation.\n\nThe Room code:\n[code:397ekayo]  if (IntroDanyel&#46;convoEvent = 0) {\n    msg (&quot;&lt;b&gt;Byron&#58;&lt;/b&gt;  \\&quot;Let's see what this is all about&#46;\\&quot;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Byron reaches for the door and turns the handle&#46;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instant the latch is lifted, a controlled force throws the door open&#46;  Byron barely dodges a flurry of raven hair as the assailant whips through the opening&#46;  The unidentified figure swiftly replaces the door to its closed position and turns to face Byron&#46;  Byron, having barely prevented himself from falling backwards over the reading chair, steadies himself to get a clear look at the intruder&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the girl’s messy, teased strands of hair, Byron, still slightly in shock, recognizes her&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Byron&#58;&lt;/b&gt;  \\&quot;Danyel?\\&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She nods as she holds a finger to her mouth&#46;  They stand there a few moments in near silence&#46;  Then, apparently satisfied she had avoided whatever danger pursued her, she pulls herself from the door and gestures towards the couch&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Danyel&#58;&lt;/b&gt;  \\&quot;May I sit?\\&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Byron, still recovering from his early and eventful awakening, nods&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danyel drops into a corner of the couch and pulls her knees up to her chest&#46;  She looks up over them at Byron who is fumbling to find the edge of the chair, his eyes focused on her&#46;  He shifts uneasily into the seat&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Danyel&#58;&lt;/b&gt;  “Sorry for barging in on you like this&#46;  I needed help&#46;”&lt;br/&gt;&quot;)\n    IntroDanyel&#46;convoEvent = 1\n    IntroLivingRoom&#46;Knocking = false\n    game&#46;hint = 1\n    list add (KitchenCupboards&#46;displayverbs, &quot;Search&quot;)\n  }\n  else {\n    msg (&quot;Danyel looks up at Byron inquisitively&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;)\n  }\n  TalkDanyel1[/code:397ekayo]\n\nThe Function TalkDanyel1 Code:\n[code:397ekayo]IntroDanyel&#46;talkTopics = SortDictionary(IntroDanyel&#46;talkTopics)\nShowMenu (&quot;&quot;, IntroDanyel&#46;talkTopics, false) {\n  if (DictionaryContains (IntroDanyel&#46;talkTopics, result)) {\n    switch (result) {\n      case (1) {\n        msg (&quot;&lt;b&gt;Byron&#58;&lt;/b&gt;  “Danyel, what are you doing here?
