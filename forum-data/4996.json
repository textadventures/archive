      "EditableText": "Okay, this is well advanced I guess. My project has background images that are 1920 x 1080. I think that reasonably covers most home setups. But there are monitors nowadays that run at higher resolutions. If I import images to cater to the highest denominator it's just going to drive up the game file size to ridiculous levels. Is there any way to put in code that reduces their monitor's resolution to 1920 x 1080 if it's higher? I realise that I'm probably asking for a feature here. But if my game is loaded on a higher resolution it's just going to tile the background imagery in a weird way.",
