Or how many posts R2T1 has made?  Or how many times any one of R2T1's posts has been considered \"helpful\"?\r\n\r\nIs R2T1 a textadventures.co.uk rock star, or a newbie who recently joined the site?\r\n\r\nThe old version of this forum would tell us all of that (and more) upon viewing R2T1's profile.  The current version only shows us games published by the user and reviews written by that same notable;  nothing shows us whether or not the user is known to be a good source of information.  (There are no links to the user's forum posts, either, which is my biggest gripe.)\r\n\r\nAlso, the site's search feature isn't all that great.  (I can't even find most of my own older posts in a timely manner.)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell from perusing old threads, the site was \"upgraded\" so users games would be accessible from their profiles, and this is when the current version of this forum was introduced, and the changes upset quite a few people.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I have no clue how any part of hosting this website actually works, but I assume a major change to the forum wouldn't be a simple thing.  I do notice, though, that the majority of users who mention their dislike of the current setup *are* people who have contributed quite a bit to the Quest community, and their constructive criticism is normally not very well-received.\r\n\r\n---\r\nConcerning R2T1:\r\n\r\nR2T1 was a forum member long before I came along.\r\n\r\nI have found nearly every post I've seen from R2T1 helpful (or at least pertinent).\r\n\r\nI'm getting a feeling R2T1 lives in the same country I do (but the UK seems to be going through a similar situation, so I may be off-base).  The suggestion to \"take up a career as a political journalist or better yet, a politician\" makes me think this,  because I said pretty much the same thing to a longtime friend of mine the day before yesterday...  He had (inadvertently) put words in my mouth in (what I viewed as) an attempt to \"Fox\" his way out of answering a direct question (to which he did not like the answer)...  Grrr...\r\n\r\nThe problem my friend and I have is that we each think we are the one who is right, and the common ground we once shared is hard to find (and navigate) these days.\r\n\r\nYou see, there are two realities in America at the moment, and which one you are in depends upon where you get your information, which news you watch and/or which politician(s) you trust (if any).  Those of us who are fond of objective truths are a little on edge lately as a result of this.  It's hard to talk to friends and family members when you can't agree on what the actual facts are and form your opinions based on a shared reality...\r\n\r\nMy friend and I ended up exchanging mumbled apologies and deciding to agree to disagree on some things (ahem -- facts), rendering the topics taboo henceforth (which is NOT good for society, but seems to be better than losing a friend).\r\n\r\n...but I digress.\r\n\r\nI think R2T1 made a valid point, and so did Silver.  I see both of these issues (server issues & forum functionality) as threats to the Quest community.  The issues with the web player are definitely more threatening to the survival of Quest than the lack of a better forum, but most of us who frequent the forum don't even try to play games online.  And I see Quest as more of a learning experience than anything else.  So, if the forum were to fade away, the newbies would be at a disadvantage, and quality of games would likely worsen, but Pixie will be around for quite a while.  As will manowar, mrangel, HK, XM, DarkLizerd, Pertex, Forgewright, Dcoder, jmne, DavyB, and... well, the list goes on, but those guys alone were the main contributors for the first few months when I found this site and taught me (more than) everything I needed to know to create Quest games.\r\n\r\nSo, could a substandard forum alone be detrimental to Quest?  I don't think so, but a better forum would definitely provide a major boost to the site's popularity, which could only be a good thing; right?\r\n\r\nAs far as the server issues are concerned, I believe that is a problem which would need to be handled monetarily (but, again, I don't really know much about how the site works, so I may be mistaken).  If we had a better forum, we'd have more traffic, which would theoretically lead to more money from the ads, which would probably lead to better servers.\r\n\r\nAgain, I may be wrong here.  Please correct me if I am.  (I seek the truth.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlso, I sense that jmne has been exposed to some T.S. Eliot?\r\n\r\n---\r\nOh...\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention Cheese, didn't I?\r\n\r\nCheese is new, but he's cool; seems to be a fluid-thinker; is a fast learner; and he's a good friend.\r\n\r\n(Don't tell him I said any of that.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nSilver, from what I've gathered, is also cool.\r\n\r\nSo, we're all a bunch of Fonzies, right?\r\n\r\n(Yeah, I'm right -- because we're all cool.  Hey!)\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlso, I know the site has ads on pages outside of the forum. So, the site doesn't solely depend on the forum traffic to make money, but...\r\n\r\n...well, I'm just rambling at this point...\r\n\r\nEveryone gets the message, I hope.\r\n\r\nIf not, here it is:  I'm a crazy person!  Bwahahahaha!!!",

The issues with the web player are definitely more threatening to the survival of Quest than the lack of a better forum, but most of us who frequent the forum don't even try to play games online.  And I see Quest as more of a learning experience than anything else.  So, if the forum were to fade away, the newbies would be at a disadvantage, and quality of games would likely worsen, but Pixie will be around for quite a while.  As will manowar, mrangel, HK, XM, DarkLizerd, Pertex, Forgewright, Dcoder, jmne, DavyB, and... well, the list goes on, but those guys alone were the main contributors for the first few months when I found this site and taught me (more than) everything I needed to know to create Quest games.</p>\n<p>So, could a substandard forum alone be detrimental to Quest?  I don't think so, but a better forum would definitely provide a major boost to the site's popularity, which could only be a good thing; right?</p>\n<p>As far as the server issues are concerned, I believe that is a problem which would need to be handled monetarily (but, again, I don't really know much about how the site works, so I may be mistaken).  If we had a better forum, we'd have more traffic, which would theoretically lead to more money from the ads, which would probably lead to better servers.</p>\n<p>Again, I may be wrong here.  Please correct me if I am.  (I seek the truth.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Also, I sense that jmne has been exposed to some T.S. Eliot?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Oh...</p>\n<p>I forgot to mention Cheese, didn't I?</p>\n<p>Cheese is new, but he's cool; seems to be a fluid-thinker; is a fast learner; and he's a good friend.</p>\n<p>(Don't tell him I said any of that.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Silver, from what I've gathered, is also cool.</p>\n<p>So, we're all a bunch of Fonzies, right?</p>\n<p>(Yeah, I'm right -- because we're all cool.  Hey!)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Also, I know the site has ads on pages outside of the forum. So, the site doesn't solely depend on the forum traffic to make money, but...</p>\n<p>...well, I'm just rambling at this point...</p>\n<p>Everyone gets the message, I hope.</p>\n<p>If not, here it is:  I'm a crazy person!  Bwahahahaha!!!</p>\n\n",

I’m moving away from a hacked together collection of PHP scripts and WordPress, and to a new site built on .NET and hosted on the Azure cloud platform.\r\n\r\n>There are a number of things I’ve wanted to add for a while now, but the old site architecture made it difficult for me to change things. On the new website it will be much easier for me to implement new functionality...\r\n\r\nhttps://alexwarren.uk/2013/04/20/the-new-textadventures-co-uk/\r\n>I have completely redeveloped the website from scratch. I’ve kept the design fairly minimal - the idea is to let the games stand out, make it easy to browse them, and make the site more accessible to smartphone and tablet devices.\r\n\r\nhttps://alexwarren.uk/2013/05/07/how-am-i-doing-the-quest-annual-review-201213/\r\n>It’s also been really positive to see the site stats going up, loads of new games being created, and the forums getting busier. The new-look website which I launched a couple of weeks ago is doing well - it looks cleaner and more engaging to me, but more importantly the feedback is good and early indications from Google Analytics suggest people are staying longer on the site too.\r\n\r\nLater on that same page, he mentions you (DavidW):\r\n>Anybody got anything negative to say? To me, constructive criticism is more useful than a nice slap on the back. I’ve not actually seen much in the way of “bad press” this year, but one can always rely on forum member davidw for a choice quote. Over on the Adrift forum he writes:\r\n\r\n>>    Quest may attract the lion's share of the IF market right now, but it still doesn't produce much in the way of good games. \"Quality over quantity\" after all.\r\n\r\n>Personally, I am perfectly happy for most of the games on the website not to match up to davidw’s standards. Some poor quality games are, I think, the price to pay for giving people accessible tools with which to build things and express themselves. Many users are young and are trying out writing and programming for the first time - we’ve all got to start somewhere. This site relies on user-submitted reviews to highlight what’s good - and authors value feedback too. So whether you like a game or not, be sure to leave a review!\r\n\r\n***NOTE:  If we were to review games honestly, we'd be in for a fight nearly every time we reviewed a bad game.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n**\\>There's so much wrong with it **[the forum]** that nothing short of nuking the place and starting again would ever fix it.**\r\n\r\nIf that ever happens, I hope it sort of works like the freecodecamp forum.  I don't like the looks of the freecodecamp forum, mind you, but the features are nice.  For instance, if a user were to create a new forum post to ask how to use stats in a game, the site would search through all the existing threads and display the links to any similar threads, asking \"WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW ANY OF THESE SIMILAR THREADS BEFORE CREATING A NEW THREAD ON THIS SUBJECT?\"\r\n\r\nThat is the bees knees!  Most of the threads here are asking the same 5 or 6 questions over and over again, and each \"duplicate\" thread contains its own, little nugget of wisdom.  This is not very efficient from any perspective.\r\n\r\nIf the site popped up similar threads before the user actually posted a question, *and*&nbsp;the threads stayed open until a moderator chose to close them, that would be a major improvement.  It would also be nice to click on a user to view all of their posts (and that includes our own posts).

At first, no one was willing to step in and take over, and Alex was leaning towards shutting the site completely down.\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.textadventures.co.uk/2016/12/07/looking-for-a-new-owner-for-textadventures-co-uk-and-quest/\r\n\r\nEventually, it seems that JayNabonne convinced The Pixie to team up with him to take over the Quest side of things (including the software and answering Quest inquiries on the forum), and manowar decided to take over the site and Squiffy.  (Alex mentioned two others who would be in charge of the servers, but I *think* manowar ended up doing that as well.  Again, I may be mistaken.)\r\n\r\nNow, if I've pieced it all together correctly, Pixie was supposed to have help from Jay, but Jay didn't hang around very long.  (It seems he decided he could create [his own engine](https://github.com/jaynabonne/responsif).)  And manowar was supposed to be able to focus on the site and Squiffy, without worrying about the servers crashing every other day.  (Again, manowar may not be the server guy, but I assume so, because I've never noticed any mention of those other two guys.   I know that doesn't mean they definitely don't exist, though.)\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.textadventures.co.uk/2017/01/11/meet-the-new-textadventures-co-uk-team/\r\n\r\nSo, it was supposed to be a team effort between five people, but, in the end, only Pixie and manowar stuck around.  \r\n\r\nAnd, if you read through [this blog post](https://blog.textadventures.co.uk/2016/12/07/looking-for-a-new-owner-for-textadventures-co-uk-and-quest/) (particularly the section titled \"Some numbers\"), it doesn't sound like anyone is making very much (if any) money off of the site.  As an American (and a true capitalist), I find this hard to swallow, but it still seems to be the case.\r\n\r\nNow I'm contradicting myself; right?  (Saying the site doesn't make money while saying the fact that the forum is difficult to navigate actually brings in more money.)  I don't know...\r\n\r\nMy theory is that the site in its current form is probably bringing in just enough revenue to stay afloat most of the time.  I also assume there are more players visiting the site than there are creators, so most of the improvements we've seen since the new team took over cater to the players.  (Even the messaging system is for the players to contact the authors for help.  It can't be for the creators to share ideas or anything, because we can't send any code or attachments through it.)\r\n\r\nSo, the forum...  It's not all that grand, but a lot of people still use it, and we are the true criminals.  Each time one of us posts something, we are saying, \"hey, it's okay to leave the forum just like it is.  We'll still use it!\"\r\n\r\n...and, even if everyone decided to boycott the forum until it was improved, The Pixie couldn't join the boycott.  He *is* Quest.  Also, he (like many of us) seems to simply enjoy helping people, especially when helping someone learn how to code.  (Plus, I'm pretty sure that Pixie (like the rest of us) doesn't make a dime from any of this.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo, when users seek information on the forum, it's hard to find it.  That means the users have to look through more pages, which means we are subjected to more ads.\r\n\r\nIf the forum were improved, this would not be case.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like it would take a lot of time and effort to replace the forum.  (I have no clue what would be involved, but I assume it would need to be totally rewritten, and the author would need to be fluent in .NET and Azure.)\r\n\r\nBeing that new users are on the forum every day, and only 3 to 5 people complain about the forum (which only happens about 3 to 5 times a year), it would seem that the best business decision would be to leave any forum improvements on the back burner and focus on attracting more players.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to increase the number of pages visited, each page displaying a different ad, any improvements made to the forum would be counter-productive.  ...unless this were to quickly attract a large number of new users, which seems doubtful to me, no matter what the improvements were.",

I’m moving away from a hacked together collection of PHP scripts and WordPress, and to a new site built on .NET and hosted on the Azure cloud platform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are a number of things I’ve wanted to add for a while now, but the old site architecture made it difficult for me to change things. On the new website it will be much easier for me to implement new functionality...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>https://alexwarren.uk/2013/04/20/the-new-textadventures-co-uk/</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have completely redeveloped the website from scratch. I’ve kept the design fairly minimal - the idea is to let the games stand out, make it easy to browse them, and make the site more accessible to smartphone and tablet devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>https://alexwarren.uk/2013/05/07/how-am-i-doing-the-quest-annual-review-201213/</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s also been really positive to see the site stats going up, loads of new games being created, and the forums getting busier. The new-look website which I launched a couple of weeks ago is doing well - it looks cleaner and more engaging to me, but more importantly the feedback is good and early indications from Google Analytics suggest people are staying longer on the site too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later on that same page, he mentions you (DavidW):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anybody got anything negative to say? To me, constructive criticism is more useful than a nice slap on the back. I’ve not actually seen much in the way of “bad press” this year, but one can always rely on forum member davidw for a choice quote. Over on the Adrift forum he writes:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Quest may attract the lion's share of the IF market right now, but it still doesn't produce much in the way of good games. \"Quality over quantity\" after all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I am perfectly happy for most of the games on the website not to match up to davidw’s standards. Some poor quality games are, I think, the price to pay for giving people accessible tools with which to build things and express themselves. Many users are young and are trying out writing and programming for the first time - we’ve all got to start somewhere. This site relies on user-submitted reviews to highlight what’s good - and authors value feedback too. So whether you like a game or not, be sure to leave a review!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE:  If we were to review games honestly, we'd be in for a fight nearly every time we reviewed a bad game.</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>&gt;There's so much wrong with it <strong>[the forum]</strong> that nothing short of nuking the place and starting again would ever fix it.</strong></p>\n<p>If that ever happens, I hope it sort of works like the freecodecamp forum.  I don't like the looks of the freecodecamp forum, mind you, but the features are nice.  For instance, if a user were to create a new forum post to ask how to use stats in a game, the site would search through all the existing threads and display the links to any similar threads, asking \"WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW ANY OF THESE SIMILAR THREADS BEFORE CREATING A NEW THREAD ON THIS SUBJECT?\"</p>\n<p>That is the bees knees!  Most of the threads here are asking the same 5 or 6 questions over and over again, and each \"duplicate\" thread contains its own, little nugget of wisdom.  This is not very efficient from any perspective.</p>\n<p>If the site popped up similar threads before the user actually posted a question, <em>and</em>&nbsp;the threads stayed open until a moderator chose to close them, that would be a major improvement.  It would also be nice to click on a user to view all of their posts (and that includes our own posts).

Maybe a special heading from those in charge.</li>\n<li>How about a donation button?</li>\n<li>Better explanations of material in the Wiki. Just giving a technical explanation blows. Needs scripting examples.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*I do have problems searching due to my focusing issues. I will start a search and an hour later I'm watching monkeys pick each others bungholes and can't remember what I needed in the first place.</p>\n<p>I have tried every text game engine I can find and Quest is by far the easiest to use for someone without coding knowledge. (opinion)</p>\n<p>Glad to see there is opinions about the state of the forums. That is how change comes about, but I have learned one thing in business...</p>\n<p>Never blame your boss or customer. Always point to the business system and always offer solutions to any issues you may bring up. Leave others with an open invitation to help and not on the defensive.</p>\n<p>Never steal another man's sack lunch. His wife may have handle his sack before making it.</p>\n<p>Never expect a lot from my posts.</p>\n\n",
