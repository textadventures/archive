Similarly, the game will track the Player's Karma, which would take the place of Score in this case.\r\n\r\nAlso would it be possible to make the Score (custom or otherwise) a variable?  My plan is to have negative Karma provide a percentage chance for an event to occur.  (Being vague cause I don't want to spoil too much.)\r\n\r\nWhile I have coded other stuff before, this is my first attempt with Java.  Everything else I want to do seems pretty simple.
