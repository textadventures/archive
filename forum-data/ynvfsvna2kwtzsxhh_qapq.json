Depresiv, of the same community has lamented the [plight](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.int-fiction/_4ZzdAxBh1M) of non-English IF communities.\r\n\r\nNow, it would be difficult to translate even the few Squiffy commands into many other languages, not to mention the documentation. However, I don't think that's immediately necessary, as there really are very few Squiffy commands. \r\n\r\nWhat _would_ be helpful immediately is an easy way to change the \"restart\" button to a another word. Maybe I'm just nitpicking, but it's slightly annoying to have this English word \"restart\" at the top of every section of my Mandarin game.\r\n\r\nThank you, Alex Warren, for inventing Squiffy!",
