If it wasn't for Quest, I would've given up on my dreams of making games a long time ago.  And to thank him and the community I'm publishing code that can advance the field of game books starting with this little number:  A random page link order function.\n \nThis script will print out a list of links in a random order which will remove the redundancy of &quot;oh yeah I have to select the first link... first link... second link... first link again... then third link&quot;, making gamebooks more tedious in a way that adds a level of awesomeness in my opinion.\n\nUPDATE 12/7/13: Now the process is in one function with THREE parameters that'll save space both in game data and script blocks.  Note that the parameters must be delimited lists, the delimiter is a parameter which you can choose.  If a page name or link text has the delimiting character in them the function will process it as separate values.\n\nNotes:  I made this script as easy-to-implement as possible, but if you have any questions please ask me.",
