I'm relatively new to Quest, and I'm trying to figure out how to output information from the game to somewhere else, like a spreadsheet, website, or email.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, if several people were playing at a time, on different computers, potentially in different cities, and at the end the game it sent the contents of their inventories to a central location where we could compare how people did and who all discovered what, ideally in real time as they each hit the end.  What I don't want to do is have to pull up an email browser or any other software, because the computers they are playing this on will be mostly burner laptops just for competition play and won't be set up for much else.
