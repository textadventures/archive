      "EditableText": "This is a problem with the mapping code. It doesn't work with teleporting. It starts in the room you start in and builds from there. Jumping into a random room confuses it, as the new room has possibly not been laid out yet and so doesn't have any grid variables.\n\nIs this room part of the same contiguous rooms as what you have been in? In other words, can you get to it by normal room movement anyway, or is it a completely different set of rooms?\n\nThe only way to solve this would be somehow have code that &quot;visits&quot; all the rooms ahead of time to generate the full layout. I have something like that if you wish, but all the rooms need to be connected somehow so that the entire room set can be visited.",
