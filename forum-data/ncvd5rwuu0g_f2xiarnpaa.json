      "EditableText": "> <code style=\"color: green\">list = GetDirectChildren(this)</code>\r\n\r\nThat looks right. The variable `list` is now an objectlist containing all the objects inside `this` (which I assume is the bag here)\r\n\r\n> `s = PickOneString (list)`\r\n\r\nThe function `PickOneString` takes a single argument, assumes it is a list, and returns one element from it. However, this function is of type **string**. Your list here is a list of objects, so you should be using `PickOneObject`.\r\n\r\n> <code style=\"color: green\">MoveObject (s, player)</code>\r\n\r\nThis should work fine, so long as `s` is actually an object.\r\n\r\n> `msg (\"You pulled out \"s\", how nice.\")`\r\n\r\nYou can't just put a string and a variable next to each other. You need to tell Quest how to combine them.\r\n\r\nIf `s` was a string, you could do:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"You pulled out \" + s + \", how nice.\")\r\n```\r\nBut as `s` is an object, you need to convert it to a string first. The usual way of doing this is one of:\r\n* <code style=\"color: green\">msg (\"You pulled out \" + GetDisplayAlias(s) + \", how nice.\")</code> (shows the object's name or alias. For example \"You pulled out ball\")\r\n* <code style=\"color: green\">msg (\"You pulled out \" + GetDisplayName(s) + \", how nice.\")</code> (this version includes the prefix. For example \"You pulled out a ball\")\r\n* <code style=\"color: green\">msg (\"You pulled out \" + GetDisplayNameLink(s, \"object\") + \", how nice.\")</code> (this version makes the name a clickable link, if your game has links enabled)\r\n* <code style=\"color: green\">msg (\"You pulled out {object:\" + s.name + \"}, how nice.\")</code> (actually the same as the previous one)",
