      "EditableText": "the backpage/returning to previous page, is much more complicated ... I'm just confused about how to do it in what would be an easy way to help you with doing it (I can help you in a less-elegant way, but it'd be more difficult/confusing for you and I in trying to explain/guide you through it. What I'm talking about with my problem, doesn't match up with your buttons/options/drop-downs/etc in the GUI~Editor, I'm talking more at the quest coding level, which doesn't really match up with that stuff you know about in the GUI~Editor) ... so, let me help you just with basic/general Attribute usage for now:\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nanyways, for Attribute usage (adding/creating/setting/changing/altering/re-setting/etc):\r\n\r\n```\r\ngenerally, you got/want/need Attributes (with initial Values) that you want/need to have existing at the start of your game, which in the GameBook, is done via the:\r\n\r\n'game' Game Object -> 'Scripts' Tab -> 'start' Script -> (see below: add new script ->  blah blah blah)\r\n\r\notherwise, at any time or any where/means, via your Page's scripting (and/or which can optionally call upon your Functions, which hold your scripting), you can have a new Attribute (with an initial Value) be created and/or change an existing Attribute's Value:\r\n\r\n'whatever' Page Object -> ( run as script / Page Type: [script] or [script+text] ) -> add new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nI am going to tell you to use the '[EXPRESSION]' option (which let's me/you-lol code in what scripting/action/etc you want directly --- my way of cheating past not knowing the GUI~Editor and its script options, lol), as I don't know the GUI~Editor's script options, but if you do, then you can click on the specific [xxx] script options\r\n\r\nset variable NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n// do note/see that there IS a dot/period separating the 'NAME_OF_OBJECT' and the 'NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE'\r\n// this dot/period is required/very important, as it's the code way of telling quest that, that that Attribute will be added into/inside/(contained)-within that Object, which is what makes it an Attribute VARIABLE, which is your 'bread', lol. (The 'if' Scripts is/are your 'butter', lol)\r\n\r\nHowever, in GameBook, you only have two Objects (we'll not get into messing with the Page Objects' Attributes for now), for (adding/creating) your own/custom Attributes:\r\n\r\nthe 'game' Game Object and the 'player' Player Object\r\n\r\nso, replace my 'NAME_OF_OBJECT' with either:\r\n\r\ngame\r\n~OR~\r\nplayer\r\n\r\nset variable game.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n~OR~\r\nset variable player.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\nnext, replace my 'NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE', with whatever you want to call/name/label-as your new Attribute or use an existing Attribute's name if you want to change/alter/re-set its Value, for example (what will be my 'strength' Integer Attribute with its new Value of '100'):\r\n\r\nset variable game.strength = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n~OR~\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\nthen, replace my 'VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION' with whatever you want (depends upon what Attribute Type you want it to be, of course --- what you put in for my 'VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION' determines what Attribute Type your Attribute will be --- quest is programmed to do b able to do this), for example (what will be my 'strength' Integer Attribute with its new Value of '100'):\r\n\r\nset variable game.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\r\n~OR~\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\r\n\r\nnow, we've created/added a 'strength' Integer Attribute (contained) within our 'game' Game Object, and stored it with the Value of '100'\r\n~OR~\r\nnow, we've created/added a 'strength' Integer Attribute (contained) within our 'player' Player Object, and stored it with the Value of '100'\r\n\r\nwe, can now use this ( 'game.strength' ~~~OR~~~ 'player.strength' ) Integer Attribute in other scripting, for a full example, including an example of a simple displayment (GUI/Editor: 'print a message' Script, or in-Code: 'msg' Script) of it:\r\n\r\n'game' Game Object -> 'Scripts' Tab -> 'start' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\r\n\r\n'Page1' Page Object -> 'whatever' Tab -> Page Type: [script] or [script+text] -> (see below)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"Player's Strength: \" + player.strength\r\n\r\n// this will output/display/show during game play:\r\n// Player's Strength: 100\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nfor a much more detailed resource on Attribute usage (and the 'if' Script):\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk\r\n\r\n(it's a bit more advanced especially having a lot of coding in it, but try to learn the different Attribute Types, see if you can create each of the basic Attribute Types: int --- integer, string, and boolean)\r\n\r\nAnswer/Help:\r\n\r\n'game' Game Object -> 'Scripts' Tab -> 'start' Script -> (see below, repeat as needed)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below, repeat as needed)\r\n\r\n// Integer Attribute example:\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\r\nset variable game.strength = [EXPRESSION] 75\r\nset variable game.orc_monster_strength = [EXPRESSION] 25\r\nset variable game.state_as_an_integer = [EXPRESSION] 0\r\n\r\n// String Attribute examples:\r\nset variable player.sex = [EXPRESSION] \"female\"\r\nset variable player.alias = [EXPRESSION] \"karinchan999\"\r\nset variable game.state_as_a_string = [EXPRESSION] \"0\"\r\n\r\n// Boolean Attribute examples:\r\nset variable player.dead = [EXPRESSION] false\r\nset variable player.flying = [EXPRESSION] false\r\nset variable player.walking = [EXPRESSION] true\r\nset variable game.orc_monster_dead = [EXPRESSION] false\r\nset variable game.ogre_monster_dead = [EXPRESSION] true\r\n\r\n'Page1' Page Object -> 'whatever' Tab -> Page Type: [script] or [script+text] -> (see below, repeat as needed)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'output' section/category -> 'print a message' Script -> (see below, repeat as needed)\r\n\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"Player's Strength: \" + player.strength\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] player.strength + \" Player's Strength\"\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] player.strength\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"Game's Strength: \" + game.strength\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] game.strength + \" Game's Strength\"\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] game.strength\r\nprint [EXPRESSION] ... etc etc etc .... see if you can do all of the Attributes above-above (see the 'Integer, String, Boolean examples sections), and then get them set up correctly with these 'print a message -> [exprssion]' Scripts, and see them displayed during game play\r\n\r\nthen, see if you can follow along in my more detailed link above, in doing addition/subtraction/multiplication/division... and then, beyond, lol\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nactually, I got a step by step guide on creating your own demo game (though it's for a Text Adventure, but I'd still recommend trying to do it, as the Attributes and 'if' Scripting is for the most part exactly the same between a Text Adventure and GameBook, with the only difference is that the GameBook uses its 'Page Type: [script] or [script+text] and its 'game.start' Script for the creation of Attributes at game start --- and the GameBook doesn't have the 'statusattributes' String Dictionary Attributes --- at least I don't think so, anyways, lol):\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/5387/i-really-need-help#37375\r\n\r\nask if you need any help, as this is a lot to do and very complex, you likely are overwhelmed (especially if you actually read my posts, lol) with too much information... it's like that for everyone, it was at least for me... I was so confused and overwhelmed when I first started too!",

What I'm talking about with my problem, doesn't match up with your buttons/options/drop-downs/etc in the GUI~Editor, I'm talking more at the quest coding level, which doesn't really match up with that stuff you know about in the GUI~Editor) ... so, let me help you just with basic/general Attribute usage for now:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>anyways, for Attribute usage (adding/creating/setting/changing/altering/re-setting/etc):</p>\n<pre><code>generally, you got/want/need Attributes (with initial Values) that you want/need to have existing at the start of your game, which in the GameBook, is done via the:\n\n'game' Game Object -&gt; 'Scripts' Tab -&gt; 'start' Script -&gt; (see below: add new script -&gt;  blah blah blah)\n\notherwise, at any time or any where/means, via your Page's scripting (and/or which can optionally call upon your Functions, which hold your scripting), you can have a new Attribute (with an initial Value) be created and/or change an existing Attribute's Value:\n\n'whatever' Page Object -&gt; ( run as script / Page Type: [script] or [script+text] ) -&gt; add new script -&gt; 'variables' section/category -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; (see below)\n\nI am going to tell you to use the '[EXPRESSION]' option (which let's me/you-lol code in what scripting/action/etc you want directly --- my way of cheating past not knowing the GUI~Editor and its script options, lol), as I don't know the GUI~Editor's script options, but if you do, then you can click on the specific [xxx] script options\n\nset variable NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\n// do note/see that there IS a dot/period separating the 'NAME_OF_OBJECT' and the 'NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE'\n// this dot/period is required/very important, as it's the code way of telling quest that, that that Attribute will be added into/inside/(contained)-within that Object, which is what makes it an Attribute VARIABLE, which is your 'bread', lol. (The 'if' Scripts is/are your 'butter', lol)\n\nHowever, in GameBook, you only have two Objects (we'll not get into messing with the Page Objects' Attributes for now), for (adding/creating) your own/custom Attributes:\n\nthe 'game' Game Object and the 'player' Player Object\n\nso, replace my 'NAME_OF_OBJECT' with either:\n\ngame\n~OR~\nplayer\n\nset variable game.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\n~OR~\nset variable player.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\n\nnext, replace my 'NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE', with whatever you want to call/name/label-as your new Attribute or use an existing Attribute's name if you want to change/alter/re-set its Value, for example (what will be my 'strength' Integer Attribute with its new Value of '100'):\n\nset variable game.strength = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\n~OR~\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\n\nthen, replace my 'VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION' with whatever you want (depends upon what Attribute Type you want it to be, of course --- what you put in for my 'VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION' determines what Attribute Type your Attribute will be --- quest is programmed to do b able to do this), for example (what will be my 'strength' Integer Attribute with its new Value of '100'):\n\nset variable game.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\n~OR~\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\n\nnow, we've created/added a 'strength' Integer Attribute (contained) within our 'game' Game Object, and stored it with the Value of '100'\n~OR~\nnow, we've created/added a 'strength' Integer Attribute (contained) within our 'player' Player Object, and stored it with the Value of '100'\n\nwe, can now use this ( 'game.strength' ~~~OR~~~ 'player.strength' ) Integer Attribute in other scripting, for a full example, including an example of a simple displayment (GUI/Editor: 'print a message' Script, or in-Code: 'msg' Script) of it:\n\n'game' Game Object -&gt; 'Scripts' Tab -&gt; 'start' Script -&gt; (see below)\n\nadd new script -&gt; 'variables' section/category -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; (see below)\n\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\n\n'Page1' Page Object -&gt; 'whatever' Tab -&gt; Page Type: [script] or [script+text] -&gt; (see below)\n\nadd new script -&gt; 'output' section/category -&gt; 'print a message' Script -&gt; (see below)\n\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"Player's Strength: \" + player.strength\n\n// this will output/display/show during game play:\n// Player's Strength: 100\n\n---------------\n\nfor a much more detailed resource on Attribute usage (and the 'if' Script):\n\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk\n\n(it's a bit more advanced especially having a lot of coding in it, but try to learn the different Attribute Types, see if you can create each of the basic Attribute Types: int --- integer, string, and boolean)\n\nAnswer/Help:\n\n'game' Game Object -&gt; 'Scripts' Tab -&gt; 'start' Script -&gt; (see below, repeat as needed)\n\nadd new script -&gt; 'variables' section/category -&gt; 'set a variable or attribute' Script -&gt; (see below, repeat as needed)\n\n// Integer Attribute example:\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] 100\nset variable game.strength = [EXPRESSION] 75\nset variable game.orc_monster_strength = [EXPRESSION] 25\nset variable game.state_as_an_integer = [EXPRESSION] 0\n\n// String Attribute examples:\nset variable player.sex = [EXPRESSION] \"female\"\nset variable player.alias = [EXPRESSION] \"karinchan999\"\nset variable game.state_as_a_string = [EXPRESSION] \"0\"\n\n// Boolean Attribute examples:\nset variable player.dead = [EXPRESSION] false\nset variable player.flying = [EXPRESSION] false\nset variable player.walking = [EXPRESSION] true\nset variable game.orc_monster_dead = [EXPRESSION] false\nset variable game.ogre_monster_dead = [EXPRESSION] true\n\n'Page1' Page Object -&gt; 'whatever' Tab -&gt; Page Type: [script] or [script+text] -&gt; (see below, repeat as needed)\n\nadd new script -&gt; 'output' section/category -&gt; 'print a message' Script -&gt; (see below, repeat as needed)\n\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"Player's Strength: \" + player.strength\nprint [EXPRESSION] player.strength + \" Player's Strength\"\nprint [EXPRESSION] player.strength\nprint [EXPRESSION] \"Game's Strength: \" + game.strength\nprint [EXPRESSION] game.strength + \" Game's Strength\"\nprint [EXPRESSION] game.strength\nprint [EXPRESSION] ... etc etc etc .... see if you can do all of the Attributes above-above (see the 'Integer, String, Boolean examples sections), and then get them set up correctly with these 'print a message -&gt; [exprssion]' Scripts, and see them displayed during game play\n\nthen, see if you can follow along in my more detailed link above, in doing addition/subtraction/multiplication/division... and then, beyond, lol\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<p>actually, I got a step by step guide on creating your own demo game (though it's for a Text Adventure, but I'd still recommend trying to do it, as the Attributes and 'if' Scripting is for the most part exactly the same between a Text Adventure and GameBook, with the only difference is that the GameBook uses its 'Page Type: [script] or [script+text] and its 'game.start' Script for the creation of Attributes at game start --- and the GameBook doesn't have the 'statusattributes' String Dictionary Attributes --- at least I don't think so, anyways, lol):</p>\n<p>http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/5387/i-really-need-help#37375</p>\n<p>ask if you need any help, as this is a lot to do and very complex, you likely are overwhelmed (especially if you actually read my posts, lol) with too much information... it's like that for everyone, it was at least for me... I was so confused and overwhelmed when I first started too!</p>\n\n",
