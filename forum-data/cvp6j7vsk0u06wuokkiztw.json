      "EditableText": "Hello! I am extremely new to quest and I'm using the desktop editor. I want to make a wearable which you cannot remove, but will be removed when you put on another wearable. Is it possible to run a script that removes a wearable? I could use such a script after wearing an item to remove another wearable. Another way this could be accomplished is if there was a way to remove the \"(worn)\" next to an object that is worn in the Inventory. Then I could use flags to dictate whether the object is worn or not, and even if the object is technically worn in the game, I could make that have no effect in my game. The best way to do it is if I can make a custom \"wear\" verb, but I don't think that's possible. If there are other better ways to accomplish this (which I'm sure there are) please tell me, I'm open to suggestions. Thank You!",
