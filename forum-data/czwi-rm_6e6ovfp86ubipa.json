Again.\r\n\r\nOk, I'm totally lost today, I've completely rebuilt my game from the ground up, due to the fact that the libraries I put in my game didn't have the things that I thought they have and messed up the things I had coded myself. Haha.\r\n\r\nAnyway. I'm lost because I can't figure out if it's possible to exit to parent.  As in, I made a spaceship, which obviously moves about and stuff. The problem is, the exit from that spaceship should lead to different places depending on where that spaceship happens to be.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to 'exit to parent' or do I have to code some kind of a 'move player to room x if spaceship is in room y' thing instead of using the traditional exits?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
