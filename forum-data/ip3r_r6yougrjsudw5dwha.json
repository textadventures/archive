There are two sections that link to each other. The second room displays the text for the first room. The first room has a passage in it that replaces text if you click on it (by using 'label'). This feature works if you're in the first section. But if you click on the 2nd section and then click on the passage, the game just ends.\r\n\r\nHow can I get this to work?\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[room]]:\r\n\r\nThe room is {label:1={if not bottle: empty save for [a bottle] on the ground.}{else:empty.}} A doorway leads [[in.]]\r\n\r\n[a bottle]:\r\n@set bottle\r\n@replace 1={if not bottle:save for [a bottle] on the ground}{else:empty.}\r\nTaken.
