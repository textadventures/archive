All I need is to create a question that repeats asking said question until the user gets the answer right. Right now I have been entering in any possible answer combination by myself, but I know there has to be an easier way. This might take a one-on-one conversation to fix this problem because my knowledge of coding is so limited, so any help is greatly appreciated!",
