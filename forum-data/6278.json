      "EditableText": "So I was wondering how I might go about immobilizing the player in one particular place. I noticed someone else created a thread on this a while back (like months/years ago) but it didn't really get answered. See I originally had a backpack item that you could store things in and it would separate that weight with the player weight, but I guess it never really worked properly because a lot of people have complained about it. \n\nI went back and redesigned the way inventory works in my game. The player starts with...\n\nMax Volume: 3 \n\nAnd then I created two different types of containers; wearable and not wearable. A wearable example is the backpack and an unwearable would be like a sack or something like that. When you &quot;wear&quot; the backpack it's inventory space gets automatically added to your own. So the backpack item would have a Max Volume of 13. So now the player's Max Volume is 16. Just having the &quot;sack&quot; in your inventory also boosts that number up to like &quot;20&quot;. Yay! Right? Well, kind of. \n\nSee, each item the player gets subtracts their Max Volume carry amount. So if they have Max Volume 20, then taking an item might bring it down to 19 or 18. The system seems to work just fine. But I'm not sure how to go about &quot;stopping player&quot; movement if they are...let's say carrying 15 items and then drop the backpack or the sack which will reduce the Max Volume to &quot;0&quot; because their inventory carry amount is Maxed. I already set the code to return &quot;0&quot; if something like this happens meaning the player cannot pick up anything else, but I would also like to remove all possible exits no matter where they are if the volume of their inventory exceeds their max carry volume...so...\n \nvolume &gt; player.maxvolume. \n\nAnyone know how to make exits invisible until the volume &lt; player.maxvolume? \n\n<!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> Thanks!",

Instead of invisible, wouldn't you want the player to be able to see the exit and just not be able to go there?  That seems more realistic.  I can see the door but because I'm carrying too much I cannot move in any direction?  Instead of the exit disappearing altogether?\n\nIf you want the player simply not to be able to move, I'd use a global command to check if the max volume is met or exceeded and then print a message telling the player whatever you want to tell them.  I did something similar in X2 by typing n;ne;nw;north;northeast; etc.  I still allowed other commands that they should be able to do under those circumstances.",
