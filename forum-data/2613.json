Selet which weapon want Sword, fists, Bow etc. But if You only have a bow it wont show the sword as an option to click onto. \nI thought of giving options such as adding conditonal scripts to a menu option 'sword' so if you dont have one you can use one, but then that may get complicated with all the different types of swords. It seems like a lot just for combat, which is why I'm trying to do the first option.",
