You can also add event listeners that will execute in response to certain player events, such as a player state change or a video playback quality change.\r\n\r\nThis guide explains how to use the IFrame API. It identifies the different types of events that the API can send and explains how to write event listeners to respond to those events. It also details the different JavaScript functions that you can call to control the video player as well as the player parameters you can use to further customize the player.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequirements\r\nThe user's browser must support the HTML5 postMessage feature. Most modern browsers support postMessage, though Internet Explorer 7 does not support it.\r\n\r\nEmbedded players must have a viewport that is at least 200px by 200px. If the player displays controls, it must be large enough to fully display the controls without shrinking the viewport below the minimum size. We recommend 16:9 players be at least 480 pixels wide and 270 pixels tall.\r\n\r\nAny web page that uses the IFrame API must also implement the following JavaScript function:\r\n\r\nonYouTubeIframeAPIReady – The API will call this function when the page has finished downloading the JavaScript for the player API, which enables you to then use the API on your page. Thus, this function might create the player objects that you want to display when the page loads.\r\n```\r\nHas this been implemented on the webserver?  I don't know where it would need to be activated, but I don't see it being useful in Quest.\r\n",

It also details the different JavaScript functions that you can call to control the video player as well as the player parameters you can use to further customize the player.</p>\n<pre><code>Requirements\nThe user's browser must support the HTML5 postMessage feature. Most modern browsers support postMessage, though Internet Explorer 7 does not support it.\n\nEmbedded players must have a viewport that is at least 200px by 200px. If the player displays controls, it must be large enough to fully display the controls without shrinking the viewport below the minimum size. We recommend 16:9 players be at least 480 pixels wide and 270 pixels tall.\n\nAny web page that uses the IFrame API must also implement the following JavaScript function:\n\nonYouTubeIframeAPIReady – The API will call this function when the page has finished downloading the JavaScript for the player API, which enables you to then use the API on your page. Thus, this function might create the player objects that you want to display when the page loads.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Has this been implemented on the webserver?  I don't know where it would need to be activated, but I don't see it being useful in Quest.</p>\n\n",
