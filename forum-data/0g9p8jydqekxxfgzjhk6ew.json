      "EditableText": "SHORT ANSWER = YES you can do this.\r\n\r\nYou can have multiple characters as objects that can be interacted with. You can make multiple responses to questions and swap objects with them via tasks or even questions answered etc. FLAGS are essential key words that you allocate to a character to define what response they will give to the same question. \r\n\r\nYou will be limited to :\r\n\"Ask about object or character\" as your dialogue in order to provoke a response. But you can manipulate the conversations by the responses. Even a \"look at character\" can produce a response as well as a \"ask about...\" question. Also \"give object to character\" or \"hit character\" etc etc can produce a response or dialogue as you see fit.\r\n\r\nSetup TAB :\r\nType : object \r\nName : Merlin\r\nType : Male character\r\n\r\nFeatures TAB: \r\nUse/Give (tick box)\r\nContainer(tick box)\r\n\r\nAsk/Tell TAB:\r\nAsk about ?

But if object \"Merlin\" has flag \"riddle done\" he may say  \"Well done, here is the gem stone\" etc! You can also play sound effects or even put in your own small speech samples to enhance your game. But beware \"THERE IS A LIMIT TO ALL SOUNDS IN MEMORY and game will be nonpunishable if you exceed the limit!\"\r\n\r\n",
