Most contemporary software does.\n\nInstead, we must copy the icon from the Start folder (that [i:30f6piqz]Quest[/i:30f6piqz] does create) and paste it on the Desktop ourselves.\n\n=====\n\nOnce again, as somebody responded in my previous &quot;Enhancement&quot; thread, &quot;You do have to make an additional click or two&quot;.\n\nIt reminds me of the incredible shrinking wafer bar in the country where I live.  The wafer bar started at 50g.  Then, corporate management decided its first reduction should be to 48g.  Gullible consumers would say, &quot;It's only a gram or two&quot;, but corporate management knew that those 2 grams add up.\n\n[i:30f6piqz]Quest[/i:30f6piqz] is quite similar.  Extra clicks every time I want to select a base font.  Extra clicks every time I want to select a font color.  Extra clicks every time I want to select a background color.  And now, extra clicks when I want [i:30f6piqz]Quest[/i:30f6piqz]'s icon on my Desktop.\n\nThose extra clicks add up.",
