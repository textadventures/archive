And I thought about adding recordings, so they can practice some kind of &quot;listenings&quot; too.\nI'm creating a short activity to check if they like it. Everything woks perfect on the online version, but when I export it as html and javascript (to upload it later to the school webpage), the sound has disappeared.\nThis is the link that is not downloaded (first I recorded at home and upload it to audioboom): &quot;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; style=&quot;background-color:transparent; display:block; max-width: 700px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;//embeds.audioboom.com/boos/3813084-qsaa/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAJyfR1bcLjoA&quot; title=&quot;audioBoom player&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;\nAm I doing anything wrong?, maybe it is not possible to download it?\nThank you in advance and sorry if this is a silly question.\nBest,",
