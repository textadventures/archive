      "EditableText": "Hi all, I'm very new to Quest and text adventure games in general so I hope this isn't an obvious question. I was wondering though, is there a way to skip through parts of your game that you know are already working when testing? \n\nFor example, my game currently has 4 intro pages of text. Now I know that's not a huge hassle in and of itself, but having to go through those 4 pages every time I want to see if I can successfully take out a shirt from a drawer or read a book, etc, starts to add up. And then when I get further into the game development, I will have to go through those 4 intro pages, plus all the other puzzles I've created just to get to where I want to test something small.\n\nIs there a way to just skip all of that? So I could start testing from the room I am currently working on? Or do I have to just rush through the game really quick to test the new areas?\n\nThank you for your help. I did a search and couldn't find anything relevant but if there is a link with the answer, feel free to post.",

Let's say you start on the porch of a house but you want to test something in the basement, which it takes 50 turns in your game to even get into. As long as nothing that happens on those turns is important for what you're trying to test, you can just make a command in the porch room with the pattern &quot;basement&quot; and set the script to move the player object to the basement room (you can also set flags and attributes using it too, if necessary). Then all you have to do is type &quot;basement&quot; at the start of your game and boom, you're there, no time wasted.\n\n...Obviously you'd want to delete any commands like that before publishing the game, heh.",
