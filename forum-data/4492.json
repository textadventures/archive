The player can push a button which then randomly selects from a list of words/messages I've predetermined and displays it, but there would be an 'A' and 'B' part to message (like First Name and Last Name, as a simple example).\n\nI'm certain this feature would be easy enough to make I'm just strugging with where to start, can anybody point in right direction?\nThanks.\n\nGoosebot",

      "EditableText": "This is pretty simple to do. In your example  of first name last name, you would just create two lists, one for first names and one for last names. Then you just use Quest's random number function to pick a number between 1 and X (x being the number of names in the list) for each list, and then join the results together.\n\nUsing to generate phrases would be more difficult unless you didn't care if the phrase was just gibberish.\n\nHopefully that gives you an idea of where to start. I would give a code example but I've been away from Quest for awhile and my knowledge of ASLX is a little rusty.",
