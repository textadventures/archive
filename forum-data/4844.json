      "EditableText": "I'm at the concept/drafting stage of a new game, and I'm trying to wrap my head around how to go about creating a sort of &quot;minigame&quot; within my game.   I wanted to get some direction before I start configuring/coding.\n\nIn the game, the player gets exposed to a sort of &quot;brainwashing&quot; drug being used as a weapon by a totalitarian government.  To simulate trying to focus on reality and sort of &quot;snap out of it,&quot; the player has to try to form coherent, retaliatory thoughts.\n\nTo simulate this, I'd like to have scrambled phrases appear on the screen for about 10 seconds each, and the player has to type the unscrambled phrase to snap back to reality.\n\nSo &quot;Ym inmd si a sortfrse.&quot; Would appear for a 10 count, and during this time (or not during this time if it's easier) the player has to type &quot;My mind is a fortress&quot; and they will be returned to the game, shake off the mental haze, and continue.\n\nMy initial thought is that when the drug level (there are different levels of exposure) reaches 100%, the player is moved to a new &quot;room&quot; with no objects.  There's a little intro message about struggling to focus, and then the scrambled phrases begin to appear.  When the player types an unscrambled phrase, they return to the game.  If they don't unscramble a phrase after a certain number of turns, they slip back into a brainwashed state and the game ends.\n\nMy questions are these:\n\nIs moving the player to a room and then moving them back a good way to pull them out of the game for a moment to do the minigame and then return them?\n\nI can have the phrases appear with timers - is there an easy way to make them then disappear?\n\nThanks in advance for any help.  The rest of the game is pretty straightforward.  I just wanted to have this one mechanic that appears at a few points in the game to give it a little variety.",
