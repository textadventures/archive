I've not played text games in foreverrr and just suddenly got the urge to give them another bash. Turns out I pretty much suck at them xD I've downloaded one so far, called &quot;Wizard&quot;, and I'm enjoying myself hugely but am completely stumped. Any tips for a complete text adventure fresher?? Not just referring to &quot;Wizard&quot;, I mean like in general xD I don't seem to have the right kind of logical thinking for such things - but like I said, I'm enjoying myself a lot xD\n\nAlso, if it's not weird to ask, could someone give me a heads up on what sort of a forum this is? I mean, some that I go on are reeeaaally relaxed and personal and mostly just people chattering about their lives and whatever, and others will actually put your grandmother through a mangle if you so much as think about going off-topic xD So, how do we play it here?? Thanks! xxx",
