Also, I put it where it is, because if it comes a line or two later, if the check box on 'room descriptions' is ticked to clear screen, the message doesn't get seen. I'm also assuming that each time the player moves in the game, the variable 'exit.message' is reset to a blank string. I'm just using a piece of coding that already exists. If you look at a room's exit object, it will read:<br>\nTo: room2<br>\nType: south<br>\nAlias: south<br>\nAt the bottom of the page, it reads 'Print message when used', that's the exit.message.</p>\n\n",
