After a quick search, I couldn't find any threads on this topic, so I apologize in advance if this has already been asked (or if it's painfully obvious).\n\nI'm creating a small gamebook with Quest. However, the number of pages is growing quickly, and I'm wondering if there's any way to put certain pages (ex: one scene) into its own folder, or if there's a way to minimize the number of pages used in the gamebook. What is the average number of pages for a completed, small gamebook? 50? 100?\n\nMy other question concerns flags. Are flags replaced when you set a new one?\n\nExample, I made a flag named 'female' and set it to on. Later, I want to use another flag called 'male', so I made that and set it to on as well. Will this replace the 'female' flag?",
