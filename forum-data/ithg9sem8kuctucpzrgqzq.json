I'd love to hear from anyone who played it or even knows anything about it.\r\n\r\nThe latest version has a number of small improvement tweaks, but the main changes are (a) an Easter Egg in the original L game has been carried across to L Too; (b) it is now possible to interact with every object mentioned. In particular, all doors can be inspected and opened; and (c) an \"epilogue\" has been added to give more background information on the creation of the game. ",
