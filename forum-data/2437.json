Have being &quot;on the bed&quot; as actually a separate room to &quot;standing in the bedroom&quot;. Then you need to have two of each object - a window for example, having one in each &quot;room&quot;. Then you can set up each room differently, with some of the objects being takeable or whatever.\n\n2. If you only want one room, use a script for &quot;take&quot; for each object. If a flag called &quot;on bed&quot; is set, don't allow the player to take the object. Unset the flag when the player gets up.\n\nHope this makes sense - let me know if you need more details.",
