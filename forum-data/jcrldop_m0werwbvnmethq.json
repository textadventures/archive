Each topic can then be selected when in conversation with the quest giver to effectively 'hand over' the object.\r\n\r\nI set up boolean attributes ('qinv') for both objects to switch to 'true' when they are handed over to the quest giver (called Questgiver). Then I put an 'If' script in to ask if the other object also had their 'qinv' boolean set to 'true'. If it does, then the quest completes.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't know is how I would handle a quest that required more than 2 items to be delivered.\r\n\r\nHere's the code for one of the objects' conversation scripts which moves the object (starbloom) from the player to the quest giver, and checks if the other object (cerynol) has also been delivered, then completes if both conditions are met:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Quest giver says thanks, etc.\")\r\nMoveObject (starbloom, Questgiver)\r\nset (starbloom, \"qinv\", true)\r\nif (cerynol.qinv = true) {\r\n  msg (\"'That's everything!'<br/><br/>'Now I can whip up your potion- A TIME POTION!'\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a cleaner way to handle writing a script to deliver 2 or more items to complete a quest?\r\n\r\n**I would basically like to learn an efficient method for:\r\nIf (player) has (all required quest objects) in (inventory) then (run complete quest script) on talking to (quest giver).**\r\n\r\nI appreciate any help with this. I'm sure there must be a simpler solution!",
