How do I make it so that the character needs to answer multiple questions (3) correctly in order for something to happen? I have a switch script set up to ask the three questions and get the responses, but I'm not sure what the next piece is.  Is there an \"IF this is true AND that is true THEN this happens\" function? Is there a way to make something happen after 3 flags get put on an object? I don't know what I'm doing.  Thanks!",
