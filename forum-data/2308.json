So if your object name already ends with a &quot;1&quot;, this will be chopped off and then when it's pasted it may end up with a different number if there are already other copies. If there are no other copies, it won't add the number back again.\n\nIf you cut and paste an object with a name that doesn't end in a number, it will have its full name when pasted.",
