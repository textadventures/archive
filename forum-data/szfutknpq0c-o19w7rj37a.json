Over the last few years I've been writing free to use music in my off time for anyone to use in their projects, even commercially. Currently, I have just over 150 tracks spanning multiple genres available to download here: <https://www.darrencurtismusic.com>\r\n\r\nEach track you download comes with a signed Materials Release so you can prove you have my permission to use the music, should you ever need to.\r\n\r\nA couple of my latest releases:\r\n\r\n[\"Time's Up\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYiOrwUiJV8) is a tension building theme with dark strings, brass and some clocks.\r\n\r\n[\"Eternal Sleep\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNBi-AifxXw) is a sad medieval type track featuring the Bazantar.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, feel free to write me at desperatemeasurez@yahoo.com and I'll get back to you as soon as I'm able. I hope everyone enjoys and finds something useful\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nDarren",
