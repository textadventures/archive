I'm looking for a basic means for the player character to do battle with some of the NPCs.\n\nDoes anyone know where I could look for some ideas about how to go about doing this?  Are there any existing IF games that use a combat system that I could look at?  Just trying to get some idea of where and how to start.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nJohn",

I was trying to attach a variable of health, attack and defence to the various actors and use those stats to determine the battle process.\n\nUnfortunately I can't find anything about this and so don't really know where to start.
