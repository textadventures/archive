      "EditableText": "I've found a major flaw with the Command portion of Quest 4.02.  If I edit a command, and leave the screen, since there's no &quot;OK&quot; button, the edit doesn't take.  If I edit in an external pogram, such as Word Pad, and then load the game up in the QDK Editor, the new command will appear on the left-menu tree, but not in the Command screen.  If I click on a command that I attempted to edit in QDK, I get some 'Element' error (whatever that means), which after clicking close the whole program shuts down.  Upon reloading QDK, any changes that didn't take are now included.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Include an &quot;OK&quot; button to allow an edit for a command to take, just like for every other screen.  I already see that I'm going to have to use the QDK Editor, but at the same time, I'll have to hard-code commands just so I don't have to deal with the headache, which is a headache in itself.",
