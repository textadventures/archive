The scenario is that the player needs to remove clothing and change into other clothing, but this can only be done in a specific location (a changing room).\r\n\r\nI've read the wearable items tutorial but I'm not sure that what it suggests is what I need (and I don't fully understand it).  What I need, I think, is something adding to the remove command, along the lines of:\r\n\r\nIf item to be removed is in the lowest layer and player is not in the changing room then say \"you can't be naked here\", else do the rest of the command. I suppose that what I really need to know is how to check than an item is in the lowest layer (I'm only using one slot). I've tried experimenting with GetOuter, TestGarment, TestRemove but I am lost.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
