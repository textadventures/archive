      "EditableText": "So, I have the player starting out in front of a large, hideous structure with stairs leading down.  From this starting area, the northwest leads to a ravine with a colleague you can ask questions or tell him things.  The area around the structure are dense woods with no other buildings around.\n\nSouth of the starting area is a cliff base.\n\nGoing down into the structure brings you to a hallway which connects to a circular room with an altar and an alcove.  Going into the alcove, you see it is covered with roots and examining the roots reveals a lever that moves the altar revealing a stairway further down.\n\nSo, the room below, the &quot;Dark Shrine&quot;, is bathed in a sort of sentient darkness that even prevents normal light from shining through.  The darkness itself is not dangerous but it can cover up areas so you can't see them - in this case, a very deep hole on the floor that is fatal should you stumble into it.\n\nYou need to find this contraption that I call a Fulgurator to place on your normal lamp to Will (Will is my world's fancy way of saying 'enchant') the lantern into an even more powerful Emberlight (another fancy word for the stone within the lamp that acts as a lightsource) lantern.\n\nI'm terrible with creating puzzles, so I'm trying to think.... Where should I place the Fulgurator.  It has to be in one of the areas/rooms before you go down into &quot;Dark Shrine&quot;.  I don't want to make it too easy to find, either.  In fact, when you find the Fulgurator, it's called a 'contraption' since your character doesn't know what it's used for until you talk to your colleague by the ravine.\n\nI want to be somewhat clever but at the same time keep to logic.  So in other words, I don't want the contraption just laying on the ground by the cliff side or sitting in the circular altar room in plain site.\n\nTL;DR: I want to hide a mechanism that enchants a lantern.  I want it in a logical place but also not too easy to find.\n\nAny suggestions on making it harder to find?",

How you get him to tell you, I don't know. But he would tell you to do something like &quot;go to room X and do this&quot;, where &quot;this&quot; is something a person might not think to do. Or ever think to do.\n\nSuggestion 2:\nHide it in plain sight. Don't call it a contraption. Maybe it appears as a chalice with odd runes markings on the altar. If you take it to your colleague, he tells you &quot;Hey, you found the Fulgurator! If you press the runes in this sequence, you can upgrade your lamp.&quot; etc. Or you place it inside the lamp with the light source, that sort of thing.\n\nSuggestion 3:\nHave a book on the altar. Reading the book, you find it contains descriptions of/prayers to the various gods who could be prayed to at that altar. One of them is the the &quot;god of light&quot;. If you pray to this god (by name) at the altar, then the contraption falls from somewhere above.\n\nOff the top of my head (well, after some thought)... <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

Maybe even keep the puzzles separate from the main game, as in post the puzzles in question separately so when people player test them, you are not giving away much and then you can also tweak the puzzles just a bit for either better playability or so those who had played before can still play something new or not to give the secrets away too quickly.

How you describe something, someone else may not catch those particular clues or cues.  Playing a picture game, at least more to me, is easier to understand then reading a large chunk of text or a very peculiar worded small one and trying to figure out all the different ways of doing things in your particular game...  Some games are confusing or straight up mind blowing and I generally skip over those if I have to fight with the interface itself.  But I would think having the beginning of the game with the easiest puzzles and have it gradually get harder, as was discussed in another thread, would be the best thing.
