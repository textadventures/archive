(`MoveObjectHere (unconscious)`)\r\n    * When they wake up, use `AddToInventory (unconscious)` to disable that command again (adding a command to the inventory is the simplest way to remove it; using `RemoveObject` would make it work everywhere)\r\n\r\n2) Have a room whose description is something appropriate, and move the player there when they are unconscious.\r\n    * You might need to set an attribute to their previous location, so you can move them back when they wake up.\r\n    * In this case, you would want the unconscious command to always be in that room",
