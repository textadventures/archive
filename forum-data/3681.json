All entries must be previously unreleased at the opening of voting. This includes beta versions. The author must know who has had access to copies of their games before the competition. The game may not have been freely accessible: if you place a version of your game on a web site, the URL cannot be publicly handed out. If an entry has previously been circulated, it will be disqualified.\n\nI've sent an email to the IF comp organiser but just wanted to check if anyone here knows in case they don't check the email account regularly.",
