All of them are \"double [ description, double]single(target, single)\" types. \r\nThere is one exception. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the game, I worked with the \"single [ target, single]single(target, single)\" types. I dropped that after a few chapters. \r\n\r\nNow for the cheat section, I need to link from line 6316 backward to line 562.\r\n\r\nI constantly get the message, that the link does not exist. Despite the fact, that I have copied it and tried linking back to other targets. \r\n\r\nIs there something, that I am missing or is that single [] thing only capable to linking \"forward\" and not \"backward\" in the lines?\r\n\r\nAs usual, I would appreciate your help, I cannot find any other explanation as the difference in brackets, but maybe there is a way that prevents me from re-editing all the single bracket choices from the beginning of the game and transform them into double ones. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.
