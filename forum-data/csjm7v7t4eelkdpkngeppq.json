I'm not _entirely_ new, I'm returning to Quest after a few years with a renewed interest in writing text games (why write a book when I can turn it into a nifty little game instead?). I also have logic practice making small games in GBStudio as well.\r\n\r\nAnd to preface, up to this point I've searched for most of the things I've needed help with on the forums (thank you so much everybody in the past for having the same problems as me), but I've reached an impasse with this one - or I'm so tired I've overlooked it.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to write a trivia question with a chooseable multiple choice answer that affects a stat if you get it right (a stat I've not programmed yet, I just want to get the question running right first), and I found this post that helped a lot, but I've run into some errors with it.\r\n\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/q_k0nxiemeqqgoiz2vfn3g/multiple-choice-quiz\r\n\r\nMy code, which runs when you \"look at banjo\" for the first time, looks like this:\r\n```\r\n<function name = \"mq1_banjo\">\r\nshow menu (\"What is the standard tuning of a 5-string banjo?\", split (\"E A D G B E;D G B A B;G D G B D;A B C D E\", \";\"), false) {\r\n  // quest hidden from you, does this for you: result = YOUR_SELECTED_MENU_CHOICE\r\n  // (also for the 'get input' Script/Function, quest does the same: result = YOUR_TYPED_IN_INPUT)\r\n  if (result = \"G D G B D\") {\r\n    msg (\"A finely tuned, and well taken care of instrument.\")\r\n    msg (\"Skill up!\")\r\n    wait {\r\n      ClearScreen\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"Hmm, that doesn't sound quite right.

When I \"look at banjo\" in the game, this happens\r\n\r\n```\r\n> look at banjo\r\nError running script: Invalid variable name '<function___SPACE___name' in '<function___SPACE___name = \"mq1_banjo\">'\r\n```\r\nThe program is taking it upon itself to change \"function name\" to \"function___SPACE___name\", and as someone who's unfamiliar with this part of programming, I'm just not sure where to go from here with it.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any direction!",
