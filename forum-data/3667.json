For example, it would go like this: The player starts a fan and gets blown away to another location, OR walks on a trap door and ends up in a cellar. I realise this is simple for you, but I just cant get this to work...\nThanks.",

Each case is different. For instance, the two examples you mentioned below would each be handled differently. The first would probably be something like a &quot;fan&quot; object with a &quot;turnon&quot; handling script, which would print out what happens and then moves the player. The second - I don't know. The only movement is room to room anyway, so perhaps you could have a room where in the &quot;onenter&quot; script it prints a message and then moves the player to some *other* room.\n\nIf you can come up with a specific example that you actually want to try, and you have trouble, we can help with that. I hope the above generally answers what you're asking.",
