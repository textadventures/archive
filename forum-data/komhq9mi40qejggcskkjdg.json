I would love to get some serious feedback and in return would love to test your games if you want me to. I am somewhat solitary as no one else in my network likes IF/CYOA so would love to meet some new people. \r\nI write stories set in the real world but with some twists and turns, making room for action, horror suspense etc. The characters you play as is also very diverse like a gangster in the 20's, a witch from the middle ages and so forth. \r\nPs. i don't post the website yet as I don't know if it is allowed?\r\n\r\nBest regards Nicolai ",
