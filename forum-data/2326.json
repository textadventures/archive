      "EditableText": "I'm wondering why Quest 4 Pro hasn't been made available for free, or at least cheaper, in light of the very sound logic behind making the upcoming Quest 5 free. I'm not trying to slight anyone - if Quest 4 does what it appears to do from the descriptions and screenshots, I think it's worth $40. I've been a huge adventure game addict since I was a kid, pre-Windows 3.1, from McMurphy's Mansion to Day of the Tentacle. I've played through every Sierra game just for the sake of getting the maximum amount of points and seeing every possible outcome and hilarious death. I'm also an avid fiction writer and would LOVE to turn my stories into games. But I'm much too poor right now in my life to justify spending that much on a game maker. I'm a 26-year old self-employed web and graphic designer from Detroit city proper, and suffice it to say, times are tough. Quest was the first program for this purpose that I looked at, but I moved on to the free ones when I saw it wasn't. I spent several hours with Inform, and while the concept behind the program is extremely clever, I can't get a handle on the logic of the language. It's too vague, I need a more definite and intuitive interface. I could wait for Quest 5, but I've got (I think!) some great ideas and I want to strike while the iron is hot.\n\nAgain, I don't want to prevent anyone from getting what they deserve for their hard programming work. I guess what I'm saying is, sort of going along with the reasoning behind making Quest 5 free, I want to contribute to the author by creating some really great, thoughtful games and releasing them for free to the IF community and the world.\n\nTo the author: thanks for making such a cool program. If this logic jives with anyone else, chime in here.",
