However, no such option appears to be available for the gamebook. Is it possible to translate specific lines that will be visible for players?\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm looking for the 'loading' message when the game is booting up as well as 'type here...' when asking for input.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
