It started as a joke, a little text adventure game made for my friends with a bunch of stupid memes, but once I started to get into it, I decided to make a surrealist kind of Yume Nikki esque experience. It uses assets directly from Yume Nikki, so I don't think I would want it on the Yume Nikki Fangames Wiki. Maybe in the future I'll make a completely original fangame using Quest. Anyway, here are [some](https://i.ibb.co/x34SW1S/Screenshot-2020-09-23-at-9-03-26-AM.png) [screenshots!](https://i.ibb.co/qnqKD5d/rsz-screenshot-2020-09-23-at-91750-am.png)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any suggestions or feedback! I'll be hanging around the forums for the remainder of making this game, or at least, until I lose interest in making it, which hopefully won't happen.",
