However I do have a question for which I could not find any tutorial.\n\nI made a room with my character crawling to safety. There is a huge killer coming after him and basically I want to make a verb for roleplaying purposes. I want to be able to write: &quot;scream for help, or shout for help or shout help, etc..&quot; and then I want a text to appear which describes how you desperately shout for help. I tried creating a new verb, but it has to be connected to the object which then shows on the places and objects menu. So that is not an option, unless I can somehow make the help object invisible. So, I wonder if there is a simple way to do this so that my menu doesnt get crowded with things that are just verbs?\n\nI also wonder if there is a simple way to teleport a player from one room to another automatically once you press enter. I dont want to travel from intro to north. I want the player to teleport automatically by pressing enter or if one can make a continue command or something like that.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who answers.",

If it's all the time, then you can make the verb be attached to the player object itself. \n\nThe other things you might try are to attach the verb to some (fixed) object already there, or to create a new helper object that you then mark as scenery - I think that should prevent it from showing up in the places and objects pane. \n\nIdeally though, attaching the verb to the player is best. After all, even if you only want it in that room, that way you could have an if statement that checks where you are - if you're in a room filled with danger, then have him scream, otherwise have the narrator say something like 'There's no need for that right now'.
