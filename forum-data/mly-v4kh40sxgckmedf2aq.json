(This is going to be a long post, bare with me.)\r\n\r\nSo, I have successfully set up a working clock that displays in my status window. (Yay) It displays in 24 hour time. and it looks like --> **\"Time: 10:30\"**\r\n\r\nNow there are 2 (maybe 3) things I want to do with this. But first I want to mention, I have looked up the tutorials/guides posted for references:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/time.html\" title=\"Title\">\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/time.html</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/l6vnggisj02ykaluxqp1la/weather-night-day-cycle-solved-usable-steps-at-bottom\" title=\"Title\">\r\n\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/l6vnggisj02ykaluxqp1la/weather-night-day-cycle-solved-usable-steps-at-bottom</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/uitsc9eqskio8b_axf-ayw/simple-weather-day-night-cycle-codes-v1-5\" title=\"Title\">\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/uitsc9eqskio8b_axf-ayw/simple-weather-day-night-cycle-codes-v1-5</a>\r\n\r\n1. I want to make an am and pm label after the time like i.e. \"10:30 **am**\"\r\n2. I want to set up days (like Monday - Sunday), I assume the process will be similar if not the same as setting up am/pm.\r\n3. If it's possible, make it a display in 12 hour time instead 24 hour time.\r\n\r\nOK so I have my attribute set up like this:\r\nplayer.mins -->  To show minutes.\r\nplayer.hour --> To show the hour.\r\nplayer.clock --> To show the time in a digital format (```player.hour + \":\" + player.mins```)\r\nruntime --> my turnscript for setting the time. it looks like this:\r\n```\r\nplayer.mins = player.mins + 10\r\nif (player.mins = 60) {\r\n  player.hour = player.hour + 1\r\n  player.mins = 00\r\n}\r\nif (player.hour = 25) {\r\n  player.hour = 1\r\n}\r\nplayer.clock = player.hour + \":\" + player.mins + \" mins.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI used a turnscript because I want time to move when the player makes a move.\r\nSo, reading the refs, I'm a little confused to which step I need to take, where and why.\r\nI assume it goes something like this because of how I set it up.:\r\n\r\nIn Player Object, Attribute, Add\r\n**ampm** --> name for the am/pm attribute\r\nType: Interger, make it **0**.\r\n\r\nIn Player Object, Attribute, Click on **ampm**, Click Add **Changescript**.\r\n**changedampm** Script\r\nPut in the script:\r\n```\r\nif (game.ndcycle>1) {\r\n game.ndcycle=0\r\n}  \r\n```\r\nI understand the changedampm script is to make the **am** change into **pm** and loop it back to am, but after this I'm lost on how to set the variables to be labels as \"am\" and \"pm\" and where to set it.\r\nI assume I add it to the **runtime** turnscript I created. but I don't quite know how to set it up.\r\nI'm thinking of making another turnscript or ..?

I _think_ you have an off-by-one error in your Hour-reset, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nAs for days, that's easy peasy. Make player.daynum as an integer, and set it to 1.
