Massive objects cannot travel at the speed of light because they have mass.\r\n3.  Our thoughts, memories, consciousness are defined by *energy patterns (this is true) and tied to physical matter - our brains... our “systems” of tissues.\r\n4.  E-spec Energy has no mass.\r\n5.  Energy can travel at the speed of light.\r\n6.  Traveling at the speed of light allows us to see all things traveling at the speed of light in our our frame of references which is outside the observable spectrum to anything here on earth.\r\n7.  Traveling at the speed of light essentially makes earth-time (to us light travelers) pass very, very fast whereas in our own reference we note no time dilation outside what we deem as normal.\r\n8.  So... when our physical bodies die, we “see” (or experience) those on earth immediately after we are able to travel at light speed (or beyond).  Essentially we become 5th dimension entities like in Arrival or Interstellar (both GREAT btw).\r\n\r\nIs this heaven/nirvana/samsara?\r\nWhat is a ghost?\r\nCan energy be “judged” (I.e. is there good energy and bad energy and do they exist in different places? Dark matter anyone? 🤔)\r\nDoes this really relate to the OP or did I inadvertently and unconsciously hijack RHs post.  Sorry, dude!\r\n\r\nThoughts? Or ignore?  Either way, all cool.  Thanks for giving me a place to babble! \r\n\r\n*i realize that our memories, thoughts, etc, are directly tied to ELECTRICAL ENERGY, which does have mass, but the brain is VERY POORLY understood.
