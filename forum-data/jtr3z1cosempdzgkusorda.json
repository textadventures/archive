The status pane is configured using three dictionaries:\r\n* `game.statusattributes` defines which attributes of the *game* object  are shown in the status pane. It is edited on the 'Attributes' tab of the game object (not on the web editor)\r\n* `game.povstatusattributes` defines which attributes of the *player* object  are shown in the status pane. It is edited on the 'Player' tab of the game object.\r\n* The player's `statusattributes` attribute defines which attributes of the *player* object  are shown in the status pane. It is edited on the 'Attributes' tab of the player object (so that a game which allows the player to choose between characters can display different statistics for each of them; for example only showing Magic Points when the mage is selected)\r\n\r\nHowever, the attributes money, health, and score aren't initially in these dictionaries. They are added by the core function `InitStatusAttributes`, which runs immediately before the start script. This means that you can't hide these values in the editor,\r\n\r\nTo remove the score, you can edit the dictionary in your start script. Like this:\r\n```\r\ndictionary remove (game.statusattributes, \"score\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I'd rather show the 'score' as a percentage of progress.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to do this would be using a changedscript to update the percentage when the score updates. You could put the code in different places, but I'd say it's probably easier to put something like the following in your start script:\r\n```\r\ngame.changedscore => {\r\n  this.percentscore = 100 * this.score / 1234\r\n}\r\ndo (game, \"changedscore\")\r\ndictionary remove (game.statusattributes, \"score\")\r\ndictionary add (game.statusattributes, \"percentscore\", \"Score: !%\")\r\n```\r\n(where `1234` is replaced by the maximum score that you want to show a percentage of)",
