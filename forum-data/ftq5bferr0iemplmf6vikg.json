      "EditableText": "I wasn't really sure where to post this, but this seemed to be the best place. \r\n\r\nSo, I am currently designing a game that will function as a Choose Your Own Adventure kind of story. It’s still in the very early stages, but I had an interesting thought when I came to the character creation system. I don’t have any issues with the technical aspects of it as far as coding/scripting goes, but…well, how many options should the player have? How many do they realistically need? I think name and gender should always be included, but how much more? My game won’t have options for class and race because I’m using a classless system, and the character is always human. \r\n\r\nI was thinking adding in options for things such as hair color, hair style, eye color, and starting clothing at least. But should I add more options? I considered giving the player an option to choose their character’s face shape, mouth shape, nose shape, and etcetera, but then I couldn’t really think of a natural way to call this or bring it up later in the game, other than on a stats menu that lists the player’s appearance or when the player looks in a mirror or reflective surface. Also, how many options for each category is enough?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, at least in terms of game mechanics, setting these options for appearance usually doesn't really change much of anything (unless we are getting into a really complex dating simulator or something of that nature). They are basically only there for player immersion, but in a text-only game, it's left up to the player's imagination to visualize those traits anyway. I also think having too many options can be a bit overwhelming, especially for players who just want to get into the story as quickly as possible (for them, I’ll make a random character system so they can skip the minute details). Anyway, I thought a lot about it and looked through the forums but didn’t really find anything that addressed this question. In the end, I decided the best way to get an idea of what I should do is to get a bunch of opinions!\r\n\r\nI guess my question boils down to this: when you play a text adventure, what kind of character creation systems do you prefer? What options are a “must” for you, and what options do you like to see? Is there anything you have never seen implemented but think would be awesome, or anything that you DON’T particularly like? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any replies; it will really help me out. \r\n",
