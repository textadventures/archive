In typical CYOA style, you control the protagonist who, after a night of drinking, finds himself in the middle of a murder mystery, where he is the prime suspect.\r\n\r\n*Blackout* is completely free and should run in any modern browser. A typical playthrough takes about 15-20 minutes. There are in-game links to a feedback form, if you care to share your compliments, critiques, and suggestions.",
