      "EditableText": "Hi, sorry if this is basic or has been answered before somewhere else, but I was wondering if anyone knew a way to make it so that when the game notices a flag that has been activated by the player, the selection of verbs available to them in the drop-down menu when the player selects the object changes?\n\nFor instance, in my game there is a rope leading underneath an object. If the player clicks on the rope they are given the options &quot;look at&quot; and &quot;use&quot; in the drop-down menu. But, after the player looks underneath the object and sees where the rope goes, I want to be able to add the verb &quot;climb&quot; to the list of verbs available to them.\n\nIs there a way to do this without creating two separate robe objects, one with the verb &quot;climb&quot; and one without, and using a script to destroy the one rope and then immediately replace it with the new climbable one?",
