When a non-directional exit is created, Quest auto generates the \"go [room name]\" command. There is a 'prefix' field on exits, so maybe it would be as simple as adding the \"to\" in there.\r\n\r\n[edit] just had a quick run on my game and **go to** is accepted without me having to do anything :)",
