A worktop has a \"knife\" on it.\r\nAll these items can be taken and need to be in the same place or in the \"players\" possession.\r\nHow do I \"make sandwich\" then remove the four ingredients but keep the \"knife\"  and add the \"sandwich\" or is it just too difficult.\r\nI can't see anything in the  tutorial\r\nThanks",
