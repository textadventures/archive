The palm tree has a verb associated to it, which is climb.    The palm tree has another object inside which is called 'top of the palm tree'.  At the top of the palm tree, there's are four coconuts.  I want to make it so that player tries three unsuccessful attempts to climb it before they're able to go to 'top of the palm tree' and are able to be in reach of the coconuts and grab them.\n\nI'm a relative newbie to this program, I just am having difficulty wrapping my head around this.  Any tips?\n\nThanks!",

I made one palm tree and placed it in my &quot;beach&quot; room.  \n2.  I then copy-pasted this 'palm tree' object two more times, but this time I unticked the 'visible' box on the Setup tab to make it invisible within the room.  Also, make sure you put the name 'palm tree' in the alias box or else you will see the trees with a number after them in your game!  \n3.  Add a climb verb for the 'palm tree' object.  For the climb verb for 'palm tree' I added a script that printed a message (essentially 'you failed climbing the tree'.)  I also added a 'remove object' script that removed the palm tree from the game AND a script to 'make object visible' (palm tree1).  \n4.  For the climb verb for palm tree1, I did the same thing.  I changed the message to avoid monotony, but I also removed palm tree1 and made visible palm tree2.  \n5.  For palm tree2's climb verb, I made a successful climb attempt and added a script to 'move object to room' script where I moved my player to a room called 'top of palm tree'.  FYI, I put the successful climb script in a 'first time' script and in the 'otherwise' part of that script I simply moved the player to 'top of palm tree'.  \n6.  At the top of the palm tree &quot;room&quot; I made a one way exit down to the beach (make sure you do not make it a two way exit because then it will defeat the purpose of your climb verb!).\n\nIn short, I made three palm trees, two of which were invisible.  I added a climb verb for the palm tree in which I printed a message saying 'you fail', a remove object palm tree script, and make visible script for palm tree1.  I repeated that with palm tree1.  For the climb verb for palm tree2, I moved the player to a room called top of palm tree.\n\nHope this helps!  Good luck!\n\nXanMag\n\nEDIT:  Just thought of this... and it might be easier (less objects but you need to know flags).\n1.  Add a palm tree.\n2.  Add verb climb and put in an 'If' script.\n3.  For the 'If' part of the 'If' script, add 'If object palm tree has flag name experience', then add a successful climb to a room called top of palm tree.\n4.  In the 'Else' part of that 'If' script, add a 'first time' script.  \n5.  In the first time part of that script, add a print message like &quot;You made it 1/3 of the way up.&quot;\n6.  In the 'Otherwise' part of that script, add a print message like &quot;You made it 2/3 of the way up.&quot;  Also in the 'Otherwise' part of this script, add a 'Set object flag' script.  Add the flag name 'experience' to the palm tree.\n\nVoila!  Now when you try a third time to climb the palm tree, it will be successful!  I'll post code here if it is helpful.  \n\nThere is a 3rd way I can think to skin this cat, but it is flag heavy.  I think either of these options are quite doable for you.  If you have trouble, let me know.  Good luck!",

Below the code is a brief explanation as to what I did.<br/><br/><pre><code>  &lt;object name=&quot;climbing a tree room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;description&gt;You are on the beach&#46;  You can see a palm tree&#46;&lt;/description&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;palm tree&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;look&gt;It's a pretty run of the mill palm tree&#46;  It looks like it might be climbable&#46;&lt;/look&gt;<br/>      &lt;takemsg&gt;You cannot take a palm tree&#46;  It is firmly rooted into the ground and you are NOT Hercules&#46;&lt;/takemsg&gt;<br/>      &lt;climb type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>        msg (&quot;You put your little monkey feet on the base of the tree and your little monkey hands  around it around the trunk&#46;  You try to shimmy up the tree put you only make it a few feet before sliding back down&#46;&quot;)<br/>        RemoveObject (palm tree)<br/>        MakeObjectVisible (palm tree1)<br/>      &lt;/climb&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;palm tree1&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;look&gt;It's a pretty run of the mill palm tree&#46;  Even though you failed the first time, it looks like it might be climbable&#46;&lt;/look&gt;<br/>      &lt;takemsg&gt;You cannot take a palm tree&#46;  It is firmly rooted into the ground and you are NOT Hercules&#46;&lt;/takemsg&gt;<br/>      &lt;visible type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/visible&gt;<br/>      &lt;alias&gt;palm tree&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>      &lt;climb type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>        msg (&quot;You clamp your little feet firmly to the tree base and grab a hold of the trunk with your scrawny hands&#46;  You jump, cling, jump, cling, jump, cling&#46;&#46;&#46; You make it about half way to the top of the tree before you lose your grip and fall into the sand below&#46;&quot;)<br/>        RemoveObject (palm tree1)<br/>        MakeObjectVisible (palm tree2)<br/>      &lt;/climb&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;palm tree2&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;look&gt;It's a pretty run of the mill palm tree&#46;  It looks like it might be climbable if you are brave enough to try again&#46;&lt;/look&gt;<br/>      &lt;takemsg&gt;You cannot take a palm tree&#46;  It is firmly rooted into the ground and you are NOT Hercules&#46;&lt;/takemsg&gt;<br/>      &lt;visible type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/visible&gt;<br/>      &lt;alias&gt;palm tree&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>      &lt;climb type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;<br/>        firsttime {<br/>          msg (&quot;You wrap your feet around the base of the palm tree and clasp your hands around it like you are trying to choke it&#46;  You focus and climb slowly&#46;  Your thin muscles tremble, but slowly, inch by inch, you climb the tree&#46;  Just as you are about to lose your grip, you manage to make your way to a comfortable perch atop the tree&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;)<br/>          wait {<br/>            MoveObject (Magoo, top of palm tree)<br/>          }<br/>        }<br/>        otherwise {<br/>          msg (&quot;With as much difficulty as the your last attempt, you climb back up the palm tree&#46;&quot;)<br/>          MoveObject (Magoo, top of palm tree)<br/>        }<br/>      &#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/climb&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;Magoo&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;namedmale&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;attr name=&quot;pov_look&quot;&gt;You're Magoo&#46;  A simple being trapped in a test game&#46;&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>      &lt;look type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>        if (game&#46;pov = Xanadu) {<br/>          msg (&quot;Holy moly!

I made one palm tree and placed it in my &quot;beach&quot; room.  <br/>2.  I then copy-pasted this 'palm tree' object two more times, but this time I unticked the 'visible' box on the Setup tab to make it invisible within the room.  Also, make sure you put the name 'palm tree' in the alias box or else you will see the trees with a number after them in your game!  <br/>3.  Add a climb verb for the 'palm tree' object.  For the climb verb for 'palm tree' I added a script that printed a message (essentially 'you failed climbing the tree'.)  I also added a 'remove object' script that removed the palm tree from the game AND a script to 'make object visible' (palm tree1).  <br/>4.  For the climb verb for palm tree1, I did the same thing.  I changed the message to avoid monotony, but I also removed palm tree1 and made visible palm tree2.  <br/>5.  For palm tree2's climb verb, I made a successful climb attempt and added a script to 'move object to room' script where I moved my player to a room called 'top of palm tree'.  FYI, I put the successful climb script in a 'first time' script and in the 'otherwise' part of that script I simply moved the player to 'top of palm tree'.  <br/>6.  At the top of the palm tree &quot;room&quot; I made a one way exit down to the beach (make sure you do not make it a two way exit because then it will defeat the purpose of your climb verb!).<br/><br/>In short, I made three palm trees, two of which were invisible.  I added a climb verb for the palm tree in which I printed a message saying 'you fail', a remove object palm tree script, and make visible script for palm tree1.  I repeated that with palm tree1.  For the climb verb for palm tree2, I moved the player to a room called top of palm tree.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!  Good luck!<br/><br/>XanMag<br/><br/>EDIT:  Just thought of this... and it might be easier (less objects but you need to know flags).<br/>1.  Add a palm tree.<br/>2.  Add verb climb and put in an 'If' script.<br/>3.  For the 'If' part of the 'If' script, add 'If object palm tree has flag name experience', then add a successful climb to a room called top of palm tree.<br/>4.  In the 'Else' part of that 'If' script, add a 'first time' script.  <br/>5.  In the first time part of that script, add a print message like &quot;You made it 1/3 of the way up.&quot;<br/>6.  In the 'Otherwise' part of that script, add a print message like &quot;You made it 2/3 of the way up.&quot;  Also in the 'Otherwise' part of this script, add a 'Set object flag' script.  Add the flag name 'experience' to the palm tree.<br/><br/>Voila!  Now when you try a third time to climb the palm tree, it will be successful!  I'll post code here if it is helpful.  <br/><br/>There is a 3rd way I can think to skin this cat, but it is flag heavy.  I think either of these options are quite doable for you.  If you have trouble, let me know.  Good luck!",
