Each one lasting 36 turns. After the four of them cycle through, I'd like it to repeat so that there is an indefinite amount of days. Ideally, there would also be ways to skip time forward by resting/sleeping. Is there any way to do this easily? As always, thank you for your help in advance. ",

      "EditableText": "This is pretty much exactly what I am doing in X3!  =)\r\nI made an object called twentyfourhours and added the attribute HoursCount to it.  I set this as an integer attribute equal to 0.\r\nUnder the script tab of the game element I added this under Run script after every turn in the game.\r\n```\r\ntwentyfourhours.HoursCount = twentyfourhours.HoursCount + 1\r\n```\r\nI added objects as children of my twentyfourhours representing each time of day.  In your case - day, morning, afternoon, evening, and night.  I added an object attribute to twentyfourhours and set it to object morning.\r\nI added a changed attribute script to object twentyfourhours.  Here I added a massive 'If' script.  On the first line If added this:\r\n```\r\nif (twentyfourhours.HoursCount = 1) {\r\n  twentyfourhours.currenttime = dawn\r\n```\r\nfollowed by whatever script I want to run.\r\nAlso in the changed attribute script... I added to the original If script an 'Else If' for each time of day.  I changed the \"1\" above to a \"36\" and the \"dawn\" to \"morning\".  72 and afternoon.  108 and noon.  Etc, etc...\r\nIn the 'thens' for each else if, you can run whatever scripts you want.  I had vendors arrive and depart, NPCs move around, messages indicating that the environment had changed,  messages about player state, etc.\r\n\r\nOn your last Else If (180 if my math is correct), I simply added this to the Then:\r\n```\r\ntwentyfourhours.HoursCount = 1\r\n```\r\nand this would reset the day and everything would start all over again.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to add a wait command is to add a command under the game tab.  Leave as a command pattern and type something like the following in...\r\n```\r\nwait until midnight; wait for midnight; wait til midnight; wait till midnight\r\n```\r\nI had the following as my scripts:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"<br/>You find the most comfortable place to nestle down and hope you make it until midnight.<br/>\")\r\nwait {\r\n  msg (\"<br/>You wake up and notice that your body is a bit achy from your uncomfortable rest, but it's not too bad.  It is now midnight.<br/>\")\r\n}\r\nDecreaseHealth (2)\r\nset (twentyfourhours, \"HoursCount\", 89)\r\n```\r\nwhere 89 is the turn count just before midnight started in my hourscount attribute.\r\n\r\nI did this for each time of day, just changing the time of day that I wanted to wait until and the number associated with the turn just before the new time of day was set to begin.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.  I can send you a working example if you would like.  Let me know.  Good luck!",
