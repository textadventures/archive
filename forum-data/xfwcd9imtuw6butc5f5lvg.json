      "EditableText": "So I am not sure how I should go about doing this.  Another thread was about how to make an object both a surface and a container hybrid at the same time- meaning it could have something on top (a surface), while still have objects inside it (a container).  And although I am still working on that, and I had hinted at this problem in that thread, I figured I would make a whole dedicated thread for this here.\r\n\r\nHow much do you complicate things to seem real, while not over burdening the player on mechanics of the game play?  I assume as the game dev it would be much simpler to keep it simple, but it is not about me, it is about the players.\r\n\r\nBear in mind I have not played a lot of IFs, but I have played some Point and Click Adventure games and tried quite a few MUDs.  How does the IF community as a whole, regard the nature of searching for objects?  I do not want to make the general practice of searching objects a puzzle or tedious.  But I do want them to have to search.  So if I make a desk with three drawers, meaning I described it as such, having three drawers.  Should I make them search all three drawers?  If so how does one do that?\r\n\r\n\"Open drawer1\"?  \"Open drawer 2\"?  \"Open drawer 3\"? (I assume I would have to tell the player it is a three drawer desk)\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n\"Open top drawer\"?  \"Open middle drawer\"?  \"Open bottom drawer\"?  (I assume I would not only have to tell the player it is a three drawer desk, but that they are in a vertical position)\r\n\r\nOr \"open desk\" or \"desk drawer(s)\" and everything that can be found, should be found all at once, complete with unimportant descriptions of other things in the drawers that the player wont need?\r\n\r\nOr I could have a dresser or an armoire with six drawers of varying sizes and doors as well.  That would be a nightmare.\r\n\r\n\"Open drawer 1\"?  \"Open drawer 2\"?  \"Open drawer 3\"?  \"Open drawer 4\"?  \"Open drawer 5\"?  \"Open drawer 6\"?  \"Open armoire doors\"?\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\"Open top drawer\"?  \"Open second from top drawer\"?  \"Open third from top drawer\"?  \"Open third from bottom drawer\"?  \"Open second from bottom drawer\"?  \"Open bottom drawer\"?  \"Open armoire doors.\"?  I am pretty sure this answers my own question, but thinking allowed and in typing form.  ^^!  I also assume the game will ask the player which drawer if they simply typed \"open drawer\", but that still does not make it any less complicated.\r\n\r\nAnd that does not take into account I have both the desk and the armoire and a closet all in the same room or that there will be dozens or more rooms just like this with varying things to search...  o_0\r\n\r\nConfused yet?
