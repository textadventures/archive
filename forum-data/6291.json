If this is has been asked before, I apologize.\n\nI have been reading the Squiffy documentation, and I'm not sure how to do this:\n\n1) I want to increase an attribute and have the 'player' automatically go to a new section when this attribute reaches a certain number. I feel like this is crucial for IF / Gamebooks, but I'm not sure exactly how to do it. I'm doing a training system for my mother, and she needs to start by asking questions (to customers). Her job only allows for three questions, and while the honor system is nice, it would hamper the entire process. I need for the system to re-route her to the next appropriate [[Section]].\n\n2) I want to have choices that have already been clicked to be eliminated. IE if [[How are you doing?]] and [[How is the Weather?]] are choices under [[Ask Questions]]:, I want to have [[How are you doing?]] and [[How is the Weather?]] go back to the &quot;[[Ask Questions]]&quot; list, but only show the un-clicked/explored sections/choices.\n\nI've played &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; and I know that seeing a choice to talk to someone who has died often breaks immersion, and I feel like there is a simple answer to my questions. I'm sorry if I posted in the wrong section or this has been asked!",
