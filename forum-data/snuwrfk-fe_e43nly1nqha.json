Still a few things Im confused on, but trial and error works great (sorta like what we are making right haha).\r\n\r\nOk, either the \"flags\" feature is left for a legacy reason and now 5.8 uses different method, or the flag list are missing. The older verison, if you made a flag, there was a drop down to select from. Now all you have is a blank. The tree does not show a list of flags either. Is there another way to do this? I have a list on paper, so its working, but be nicer if I could pull from a drop down\r\n\r\nThanks for keeping up the work!!",
