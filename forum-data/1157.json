I posted it, browsed another forum for a couple of minutes, then came back to this one and found Arbutus had deleted it. So I re-posted it and then actually sat there and clicked refresh a few times. Sure enough, he deleted it again. So I reposted it. He deleted it. I think that went on four or five times before he finally realised I was going to keep reposting it until it stayed and then he left. I know it was him that deleted it because we were the only two people on the forum at the time.\n\nI could understand him deleting it if what I'd posted was really offensive, but compared to many of O_Vaughan and Unknown's insane ramblings, it was actually quite tame. Which kind of makes me suspect he's just deleting stuff for the sake of it and not because it actually warrants deleting.\n\n(Rest assured that I've kept a copy of this post so if Arbutus happens across it before anyone else, I'll just repost it.)",
