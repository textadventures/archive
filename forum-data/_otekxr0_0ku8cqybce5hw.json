It offers the best range on the market at 165 feet and is 1/8 inch accurate. With the Bluetooth function, you can quickly transfer data to your smart devices. All you have to do is install the Bosch app on your phone or tablet, and you have reduced the task of manually recording your measurements.</p><p>With the built-in inclinometer, the Bosch GLM 50 C stands out from the best laser measuring devices.

This allows you to access the distance you are standing from and change as you get closer to or further away from the target.</p><p>The compact design makes it perfect for outdoor work. The display uses an improved backlit color display that makes it easy to view measurements at any time. The best part is that the last 30 readings can be saved automatically.</p><p>It is perfect for architectural work. This device can perform approximately 10,000 measurements per battery.</p><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><ul><li>Bluetooth function</li><li>Real-time measurement</li><li>Long-range and precision</li><li>Low battery life</li></ul><p><strong>Challenge</strong></p><ul><li>The shelf life can be questionable</li><li>Complex user interface</li></ul><p><strong>#2 - Leica DISTO D2</strong></p><p>The Leica DISTO D2 is a laser point-and-shoot ruler that comes with the free DISTO sketching app. Together, it provides a sketching app that can be downloaded on both iOS and Android devices. DISTO D2 is an improved version of D1. The quick calculation of area, volume, and two and three-point Pythagoras are some of the best features of this laser meter.</p><p>This laser meter has a smart terminal that you can flip up 90 degrees to hold it on the inside and outside corners and get perfect maximum and minimum measurements. Put the end in holes and measure diagonally correctly.</p><p>If you compare DISTO D1 to D2, you will find that the latest version has shot up from just 130 feet to 330 feet.

Then the DEWALT DW03050 165 is the best choice for you. With smooth handling, it can be a perfect assistant for your renovation or construction work. This device can measure up to 164 feet. However, accuracy differs depending on the measured area. From 2 inches to about 33 feet, the method is known to have a mastery of 1/16 of an inch.</p><p>It saves the last five measurements made on the instrument, so it is easy to do some calculations later. Distances are measured in Pythagoras when pointing A and indicate B cannot be reached via a linear measurement.

This device offers a range of 120 feet, a noticeable improvement over the previous GLM 20. Unlike the first, it can also take indirect measurements, giving you volume and area with ease.</p><p>It is operated with a button with which you can take measurements at the push of a button. Also, GLM 35 offers a real-time display of the size. This means that as you get closer or farther away from what you are measuring, it will adjust.</p><p>You can also add or subtract measurements. The device can also be used in dark areas as the backlight offers an even better resolution in this particular situation.
