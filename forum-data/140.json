The thing is I don't know how to do this.\n\nAlso is it possible for a room to have identical exits.\nAn example:\nThe player moves into the bathroom after being told to clean his teeth.\nI have already set up a code to use the toothbrush on the sink.\nWhat i want is for the player to clean his teeth gain 10 points then leave through the exit. If they don't then they either can't leave. Or the leave back into the original room they came from were the scripts are all set up so they are told what to do.\n\nThanks",
