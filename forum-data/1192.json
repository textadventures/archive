I know I have been abrupt in past times, this was mainly in response to davidw verbal attacks to my person and my little doe. I've repetedly tried to mend the fences with no regard from davidw. \n\nIf the MOD team are in fact not all his sycopphants please explain how david get's a larger margin of lattitude whilst the rest of us all have to, in essence, tow the line tightly.\n\nI honestly am curious as to why this is.
