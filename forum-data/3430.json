      "EditableText": "Hi - I was looking at Quest to make an IF type game that serves up a lot of movie-like video clips for various interactions during the game, instead of being a strictly text-based. I understand that you can link to YouTube and Vimeo--but what if I wanted to make a stand-alone game which does not need an internet connection to play videos, it it possible to call up videos during a game which can be stored somewhere in the game's directory? And if not, are there any plans to implement a feature like this in the future? \n\nThanks in advance for any help or information. - Dustin",

You could also have quest play the audio clip at the same time if there is one. There might need to be some kind of preloading done to the animated gifs, but I think it could work in a pinch if you have the knowledge and software to do the conversions.

Oh well. Would be a nice enhancement though, so if somebody want to make a game that could be played offline that incorporated video they could.",
