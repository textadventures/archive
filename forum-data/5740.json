I feel this is unnatural, especially when you consider that no one would choose to read any other forms of text at such a position on the screen. When we're reading text on a website, we don't continue reading until our eyes reach the very base, we scroll the text up when our eyes get to about halfway down the browser window. This is precisely why my games have a 300px margin added to the bottom.\n\nSecondly, as someone who lived on these games in the 80s, I take them rather seriously - probably too seriously - and because of this you almost lost me right from the start, when you explained in the intro that I could play as a chicken, fox or lion. Thankfully I gave it a go and was very relieved to find that these were simply difficulty settings, as in easy, medium, hard. I think you need to reword your intro to make this clear.\n\nLastly, I'm not a fan of the hyperlinks, but again that's just my preference.\n\nAnd the positives.\n\nI get a great nostalgic buzz from your game - similar to another I recently reviewed - and got good vibes of the feelings I used to get when playing them as a teenager.\n\nThe descriptions are very well written and logical, so much so that even without the map I think I could picture my whereabouts and position.\n\nMany are not a fan of the hunger and thirst, but I like them, and got a real sense of relief when I found the spring. The berries were fun, too, as they had my finger hovering over the enter key after typing 'eat berries', as I half expected them to make me ill - kind of like Snow White and the apple.\n\nI threw a few 'testers' in there, as I do with all games, to check that I could Xamine things that you'd mentioned in the description, and was pleased to find I could.\n\nClearly a lot of time and effort has been put into this, and I look forward to returning. It's one of the few games I have any intention of trying to complete.",

A violent push in the right direction would be helpful!  Can't get in drawer.  Worm so far is useless.  Spell is useless.  Dripping water is useless.  By &quot;useless&quot; I mean I have found no use for them.  I figured it has to be one of those that helps... maybe?\n\nAlso, some minor things I noticed you might want to be aware of.  At the Amazon, your pronouns were off for some reason.  There was confusion in the her/she message.  I think 'put twine on needle' gives a misleading message as compared to the 'tie twine to needle'.  Also, upon resume of saved game, my inventory 2 was empty where there was once a spell.  I had to go back to the lair and read the bookx3.  Then I tried to memorize it again, but it said you already know that spell.  So, from this point on I copied (Ctrl+C) the name of the spell and when I want to use it, I pasted it.  You might want to consider adding 'armor' to your alternate names for the 'suit of armour'.  Memorize vs. memorise.  I think I am outnumbered here, but for us Americans, it's nice to have the &quot;correct&quot; way to spell words as an option!  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->  One of my beta-testers (either OJ or The Pixie) [i:2f8e7fpw]made[/i:2f8e7fpw] me add &quot;odour&quot; as an alt name for &quot;odor&quot;!  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->  Lastly, and I don't know if this is intended on your end or not, but when you enter the thorns (either accidentally (which I do more often than not and it drives me CRAZY) or intentionally), it gives you the option of continuing or not.

I don't know about the laggy movement though. I've occasionally had problems with big slowdowns but not for a while now. As it seems related to the size of the map, you could try the &quot;clear&quot; command (just type the word clear in the command line). That will clear the map.

If I had only thought it would have just been one little error I would have gone straight here instead.  Hopefully you see this sooner rather than later.\n\nVery minor - When you go back into the stinky water room after taking the water, you get this message: &quot;...since there's an {object: toad} lying in it...&quot;\n\nTwo errors that need addressed I noticed:\n\nWhen in the &quot;arrow room&quot; of the cave, there are two objects there in the pane but not mentioned in the text (or at least I don't think) - Siren12a and Siren12b.  Curious I clicked on them.  I think there was Look at and take - I tried those and got 'nothing out of the ordinary' and 'you can't take it'.  There was also an 'enter' option.  I clicked that.  I got this error:\n\nError running script&#058; Error evaluating expression 'DictionaryItem(coordinates, coordinate)': The given key was not present in the dictionary.\n\nI typed 'undo' and entered the other one.  Got the same error.  Not sure exactly what the issue is, but it obviously has something to do with mapping.  Unless I missed something, I don't think you intended those two items to be visible in the panes?\n\nThe second issue... and quite honestly, this one kind of bothered me.  I got to the roof with the hole in it, saving frequently along the way when I felt it was safe to do so.  I dropped down into the room and was IMMEDIATELY killed by the wolf.  I realize what I need to do to kill him, but now I need to restart the entire game because there is no way to get back to that room other than the hole in the roof.  My opinion, (again, unless I am missing something obvious here)... is to create some bit of code where the man/wolf retreats into a different room when you drop down to the bedroom (or simply lock him in the 'doored' room.  It seems like I must have left the bedroom to the north when the wolf was in that room.  Now I cannot go back in there without insta-death.  Am I right?  Anyway, here is the message I get when going down into the hole:\n\n&quot;Wheeeeeee! You fall onto the bed!\n\n\nYou are in small bedroom, once luxurious but now fallen into disrepair. The only furniture now is a small open cupboard on the wall and a large bed in the centre.\nSomething has made a hole in the roof above the bed, but this room is quite high and the hole is about 12 feet off the floor, well out of reach.\nNo! You delayed too long! The beast is upon you, and your scream is cut off as its teeth sink into your throat!\nYour world goes dark.\nYOU ARE SLAIN!&quot;\n\nOn a side note, is there a way to save multiple files after you have downloaded the game?  I type 'save' and I got the option to name it.  Every other 'save' I type after that is an immediate overwrite.  Am I missing something here?",

It seems like I must have left the bedroom to the north when the wolf was in that room.  Now I cannot go back in there without insta-death.  Am I right?  Anyway, here is the message I get when going down into the hole:<br/><br/>&quot;Wheeeeeee! You fall onto the bed!<br/><br/><br/>You are in small bedroom, once luxurious but now fallen into disrepair. The only furniture now is a small open cupboard on the wall and a large bed in the centre.<br/>Something has made a hole in the roof above the bed, but this room is quite high and the hole is about 12 feet off the floor, well out of reach.<br/>No! You delayed too long! The beast is upon you, and your scream is cut off as its teeth sink into your throat!<br/>Your world goes dark.<br/>YOU ARE SLAIN!&quot;<br/><br/>On a side note, is there a way to save multiple files after you have downloaded the game?  I type 'save' and I got the option to name it.  Every other 'save' I type after that is an immediate overwrite.  Am I missing something here?",

      "EditableText": "Hello Watcher55, \r\nJust wanted to provide some final thoughts about the game! I've already left a review--but some minor things I thought you may find interesting for consideration: <font color=white> So in my review I mentioned something about a suggestion that I immediately recanted, and that was about the stone basilisk. I wanted to examine it after I turned it to stone, then I died. And that bothered me, insofar as I believed the mythology of the basilisk to be once it is turned to stone its magic is extinguished as well; so I presumed it was a coding error that there wasn't a if(basilisk is dead) then(new script for examine). However, as the basilisk then became the weapon for the next puzzle, I take it back entirely. But maybe running some sort of script to acknowledge that the basilisk is stone, but still deadly upon re-entering the room? Secondly, in the end when running out of the collapsing cave, the room descriptors state that the upcoming room is 10ft tall. However, the magic of the sword grew me to 15ft, so I assumed I had to shrink again to escape--but I died. EXTREMELY minor detail, obviously. I simply tried running out without shrinking and it was fine. The biggest issue I had throughout was finding the right verb to use in each given scenario. I feel like most of the games use the basic \"use [blank] with [blank],\" and while I applaud your demand for more specific uses, there was some amount of grasping for the exact word. For example, when trying to melt the wax, you had melt and burn both available, but burn didn't work. So I started thinking maybe I had the wrong tactic, or perhaps was using the wrong object, instead of hunting around for synonyms.  </font> The previous is a concept I am struggling with while I am working on developing my own game; in that I am interested in complex and specific verbs, but I'd also like it to be functional with a variety of verbs. I actually don't care for the \"use [blank] with [blank]\" concept myself, because I feel it leaves a lot to assumption that the player knows why they're using it in such a way, but I definitely am struggling with an elegant solution. \r\n\r\nALL IN ALL: Really enjoyed the game. Many thanks for your multiple hints, and thank you especially for being creative and enigmatic in your hinting! I love these games but I am pretty bad at them, all things considered, so it kinda sucks when people just give the solution away when all I need is a baby nudge.\r\n\r\nAlso, in this new forum set-up, to obscure text simply type \"<.font color=white>\" (without the period) and it will work.
