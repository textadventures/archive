As for wanting to fire off some extra script events, I guess I could just add a hook in at the end of the RunCutscene procedure:<br/><br/><pre><code>if action &lt;#s#; OnPlayed&gt; then &#123;<br/>      doaction &lt;#s#; OnPlayed&gt;<br/>&#125;</code></pre><br/><br/>Instead of having the events take place after each line of dialogue (like moving the player about), I would just <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">describe</span> them, and trust the player to believe it's actually happening.  Then at the end I'd script all the practical effects of the events.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>It seems to me that a cutscene declared with this method would take more work and be more error-prone than directly coding it.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Really?  How so... <!-- s:oops: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarrassed\" /><!-- s:oops: --> <br/><br/>Okay, so I've dropped my drawers and showed a pair of my faulty knickers...the rest of you get to it.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",
