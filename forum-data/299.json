How do I do this?  \n\nHow about a room with a closed (but not locked) door?\n\nMy game has a front door, and the user has the key.  But I don't know how to implement the interaction of the key to the door.\n\nAlso, is there any way to \"call\" one game from the other?  Probably doesn't make sense, huh?  If I have a complete game, maybe with \"Chapter 1\" being an adventure.  Then, upon completion of that game, allow the user to start \"Chapter 2\" without exiting the runtime.\n\nIf it's a dumb idea, you can say so.  I won't mind.\n\nThanks in advance! - Alf",
