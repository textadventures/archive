Personally I prefer second, by and large, but with my current project I'm experimenting with having no POV... easier said that done, believe me.\n\nDescribing locations without referring to the player is simple enough, but when it comes to giving a response to an action, things get tricky. For instance, if a player eats or drinks, how do you get the game to respond to this without referring to the player? (that's not a question I'm actually looking for an answer to, I'm just throwing it out there, rhetorically, to demonstrate how tricky it can get).\n\nI'm also using very short descriptions, which is hard for me as I naturally want to try and create a strong atmosphere in my games. Hopefully I can do both.\n\nI was inspired to write like this when searching the iPhone app store for TA games. There was a screenshot for a game called [i:2qp7t7ji]A Silent Wood[/i:2qp7t7ji], showing a black screen and the words:\n\n[quote:2qp7t7ji]vision befriends darkness.\na pile of wood in the middle of the room.\nfire is dead.\nroom is silent.[/quote:2qp7t7ji]\n\nI was instantly hit by the starkness and simplicity, and found it very refreshing for a genre that's flooded with games that give us long and massively detailed passages. It intrigued me, and I think that's what I want from these games nowadays.",
