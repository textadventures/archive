      "EditableText": "> the Quest Functions don't have any documentation explained what they do and what arguments to use\r\n\r\nThe first function you need to call is `Grid_CalculateMapCoordinates`. It calculates the coordinates where the exit should be drawn on the map. It takes two parameters: The first is the room that the exit has just been moved to, and the second is the player object.\r\n\r\nThe second function you need to call is `Grid_DrawPlayerInRoom`. It redraws a room on the map, and draws all the exits leading out of it. It takes one parameter, which is the room.\r\n\r\nSo when you want to make the exit visible, the script will look like:\r\n<pre><code>MoveObject (<em style=\"color: green; font-family: initial\">named exit</em>, <em style=\"color: blue; font-family: initial\">some room</em>)\r\nGrid_CalculateMapCoordinates (<em style=\"color: blue; font-family: initial\">some room</em>, game.pov)\r\nGrid_DrawPlayerInRoom (<em style=\"color: blue; font-family: initial\">some room</em>)</code></pre>\r\n(replacing <em style=\"color: green; font-family: initial\">named exit</em> and <em style=\"color: blue; font-family: initial\">some room</em> with the actual names of the exit and the room, of course)\r\n\r\nActually, it looks like this might not work; Quest might simply decide \"I've already drawn this room\" and not do it. If that happens, you would need to add an extra function call:\r\n<pre><code>MoveObject (<em style=\"color: green; font-family: initial\">named exit</em>, <em style=\"color: blue; font-family: initial\">some room</em>)\r\nGrid_CalculateMapCoordinates (<em style=\"color: blue; font-family: initial\">some room</em>, game.pov)\r\nGrid_DrawRoom (<em style=\"color: blue; font-family: initial\">some room</em>, true, game.pov)\r\nGrid_DrawPlayerInRoom (<em style=\"color: blue; font-family: initial\">some room</em>)</code></pre>\r\n",
