Can't believe I never ran across this before.\r\n\r\nSay you have a diagonal exit -- e.g., \"northwest\" -- from room1 to room2 (and, conversely, \"southeast\" from room2 to room1).  There is only the one exit in each room.  If you are in room1 and type \"n\", Quest will move you northwest into room2!  In a similar vein, Quest will move you southeast from room2 to room1 if you type \"s\".

This bug is also true for looking in those same directions.\r\n\r\nIs this true for everyone else?",
