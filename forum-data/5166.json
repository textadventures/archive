There are two approaches here, and which you choose depends on what maintaining an object means - you may find it convenient to do some one way and some the other.\n\nThe first approach is to change the objects when the monster dies. This would work for locked exits and containers. This would be a script that runs when the monster dies:\n[code:3avvfszt]msg(&quot;Hurray you killed it!&quot;)\nbigchest&#46;locked = false\nexit_to_next_room&#46;locked = false[/code:3avvfszt]\nThe second approach is for the object to check if the monster is dead when the player tries to do something. Say there is a vase that can be smashed, on the SMASH verb, you might do something like this:\n[code:3avvfszt]if (monster&#46;hits &lt; 0) {\n  msg(&quot;You smash the vase&#46;&quot;)\n  vase&#46;parent = game\n}\nelse {\n  msg(&quot;You cannot smash the vase while the monster is protecting it&#46;&quot;)\n}[/code:3avvfszt]\nI hope this is enough to point you in the right direction (and you can cope with code to some extent).",

Once the monster is dead, move the &quot;interactable&quot; objects from a dead room to the current room and the &quot;non-interactable&quot; objects to your dead room.  Of course, you would need to add comments to your 'take message' or your verb commands to your &quot;non-interactable&quot; that print whatever message you find appropriate (i.e. &quot;You cannot do that with that huge monster in the room for fear of being detected.&quot;)\n\nJust my two cents and probably not helpful to you, but who knows... maybe you're a clueless trial-and-error type of game creator like me!!  =)\n\nHappy gaming!",
