      "EditableText": "This update doesn't really add anything new. It is just a bug-fix update.\r\n\r\nThere were a few new things in Quest 5.8  that either didn't work at all or completely crashed games when used. This update should fix all of that.\r\n\r\n### `AllRooms()` Function\r\nWe added a new function named `AllRooms` to return an object list of all the rooms in a game.\r\n\r\nThis worked in the editor during play-testing, but it did not work in a Published game.\r\n\r\nPertex has contributed code to fix this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Enter Verb\r\nWe added a way to easily add an **enter** verb to an object, but I didn't add the new code to the proper files. So, the command returned an error during play.\r\n\r\nmrangel posted code in the forum which I have stolen and applied to this update, and this is now fixed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### The Log Feature\r\nQuest 5.8 removed the functionality of the desktop player's built-in window which displayed any log entries created via Quest's `Log()` function.\r\n\r\nThat has been restored in this update.\r\n\r\nOther tidbits concerning the log:\r\n\r\n- If `game.useconsolelog` is set to `true`, the `Log` function will pass the text along via `JS.console.log()` (`game.useconsolelog` is `false` by default)\r\n\r\n- If `game.writelogtofile` is set to `true`, each log entry will be written/appended to a text document in **\"Documents\\Quest Logs\"** (`game.writelogtofile` is `false` by default)\r\n\r\n---\r\n### The Transcript Feature\r\nI did all sorts of thing wrong when submitting code to add the transcript feature.\r\n\r\nIn the desktop player, enabling the transcript during play breaks all turn scripts. No turn scripts will fire while the transcript is enabled.\r\n\r\nIn the online player, enabling the transcript completely crashes the game.\r\n\r\nAll of the transcript related issues should be resolved in this update.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Clearing the Screen\r\nQuest 5.8 also introduced the option to hide the text when the screen is cleared rather than deleting it each time (which was how it previously worked).\r\n\r\nThe JavaScript variable `saveClearedText` was set to `true` by default. So, without the authors knowing it would happen, any cleared text was saved rather than deleted. This proved problematic in games which printed a good amount of text during play. This is because most of those games clear the screen quite often, which would delete all that text from the document each time. In Quest 5.8, that text is not actually deleted, and the document gets bigger and bigger, which negatively effects browser performance.\r\n\r\nIn this update, `saveClearedText` is `false` by default. So, that should resolve those issues.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Background Color\r\nThere has been a bug for a while when using a code like `#CCC` for the background color.\r\n\r\nThis has been resolved, and Quest will convert `#CCC` to `#CCCCCC` properly now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Resuming Play Online\r\nWhen saving the progress during play online, it sometimes does not restore the existing on-screen text when you resume play.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed in this update. (This can only be tested by using the web player on the testing website.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n### `DictionaryRemove` error message\r\nThe error message for `DictionaryRemove` prints \"DictionaryAdd\" by mistake.\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## The One New Thing\r\nPertex submitted code which allows us to set a custom location bar background image, if we wish to do so.\r\n\r\nHe even went above and beyond and contributed the code for the editor (both desktop and online). So, you should be able to easily find how to do this in the GUI.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Things in the testing build that will not be in the final version\r\n\r\n### Logo and Buttons\r\nThis build of the desktop version of Quest has a different logo and the images for the buttons have been modified.\r\n\r\nPertex contributed this, too. I think it looks much better! But I don't know if it will end up in the actual release or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Syntax Highlighting\r\nThe Code View text-boxes in the GUI have syntax highlighting in this testing build of the desktop version.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that will end up in the actual release, either.",
