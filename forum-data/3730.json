Either way I have to create a new attribute called 'long description' and use the regular description attribute for the short description.\n\nBTW, how do I revert back to the original command?  I made a copy of look, then I deleted it because I didn't want to make a custom version, but the original ghosted look command did not reappear.  Although if I restart quest it does show again like normal, so this must be a minor bug in Quest.\nHaving to save and restart just to have access to it again isn't nice...\n\nThanks again, because now I have found the place to put a 'long description' as a new default attribute in the 'defaultobject' type!  Yay!\nNow I need to do is script a new field in the room tab to allow instant GUI field for entering the text.\nWait...I want to write, not code...not again!!!!!  (I [i:204p5xv7]always[/i:204p5xv7] get drawn into improving my tools instead of using them, dammit!)\nJust because I&quot;m curious: if I modify the GUI to add a new feature, anybody can still play my games on a normal copy of Quest, right?\nAnd.. is there a distribution channel for custom Quest code, if I feel I've added a worthy feature?  (not the java/VB deep stuff, just the script code used to make the GUI.)\nthanks!",
