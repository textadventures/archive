So you'd need to combine the value and direction into some sort of structure anyway.\n2) There is a function in Quest called ObjectListSort (or ObjectListSortDescending), which sorts a list of objects based on the value of an attribute.\n\n[Note that this is an internal use of objects. These objects won't appear in any room or be accessible by the player in any way. They should live outside your rooms.]\n\nAssuming you have the objects set up with their values tallied, you could have code like:\n\n[code:2o160zsj]    \t// Create a list of the counters objects&#46;\n\t\tcounters = NewObjectList()\n\t\tlist add(counters, northcounter)\n\t\tlist add(counters, southcounter)\n\t\tlist add(counters, westcounter)\n\t\tlist add(counters, eastcounter)\n\t\t// Sort the list\n\t\tsortedcounters = ObjectListSortDescending(counters, &quot;value&quot;)\n\t\t// Grab the highest counters\n\t\tswitch (sortedcounters&#91;0&#93;) {\n\t\t\tcase (northcounter) {\n\t\t\t\tmsg(&quot;The north direction was the most&#46;&quot;)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tcase (southcounter) {\n\t\t\t\tmsg(&quot;The south direction was the most&#46;&quot;)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tcase (westcounter) {\n\t\t\t\tmsg(&quot;The west directxion was the most&#46;&quot;)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tcase (eastcounter) {\n\t\t\t\tmsg(&quot;The east direction was the most&#46;&quot;)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}[/code:2o160zsj]\nThe attached game shows this in action. The counter object value attributes have hard-coded values so you can see the sort results without having to move around in a set of rooms.
