Both methods involve using nested IF statements.\n\n1. Have the game check if each of the objects is present in the player's inventory. This is probably the most straightforward way.\n\n2. Have the game set a flag, such as &quot;player.hasobjectX&quot; each time one of the required items is picked up, then use the nested IF statements to check if all of the flags are true.\n\nThe code would in both cases would look similar to this:\n\n\n[code:2v0wr21m]\nif (check for condition) {\n   if (check for second condition) {\n      if (check for third condition) {\n         &#91;code to unlock the exit&#93;\n      }\n   }\n}\n[/code:2v0wr21m]\n\nThat's obviously not the proper syntax, but hopefully you get the idea.",
