I thought maybe because the flags at start arent initialized, but even after sitting onto the seat the rules ive created in look-at are ignored.  Im sure im doing something wrong here. \n\nI'm using a flag set when player sits down onto said object. (Im not sure if a flag name has to be unique or you can use say Occupied on any object and it will be set true only for the object it was set to? or whether you need to make the flag name truely unique?)\n\nUse:\n[img:3r5b1h59]http&#58;//i157&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/t60/Daza_07/SeatProb&#46;jpg[/img:3r5b1h59]\n\nObject Setup\n[img:3r5b1h59]http&#58;//i157&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/t60/Daza_07/SeatProb2&#46;jpg[/img:3r5b1h59]\n\nI've added Get up as a verb to this object as well, but in the hyper text it only shows Look at, Sit. \n\nI think i have already mentioned it would be handy if sitting on objects declared as seating should already be in the core library, including being able to getup. If the seat is unique in someway then the user can alter the rules governing it.  It seems a lot of work just to do something basic as sitting down and being able to get up again.  But alas this is often the path to learning how things work.\n\nAlso is there a way to copy/duplicate objects? so setting up rules for similar/same objects can save time by easily copying/pasting them as needed?\n\nThanks\n\nDaza",
