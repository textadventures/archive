I got a script set up and it does what it's supposed to. Except at the end of the script this pesky little error message keeps showing up: \"Error running script: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\" Now I don't know anything about how quest script actually operates as I'm exclusively using the quest visual editing kit, and I have not seen anything here that seems to indicate the need for setting an Object reference. So if anyone could point out what I'm missing here it'd be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe error:\r\n[image](https://i.imgur.com/yZc0HeS.png)\r\nVisual editor:\r\n[image](https://i.imgur.com/wza3zEn.png)\r\nGame code:\r\n[pastebin](https://pastebin.com/sZA4sgc0)",

      "EditableText": "Hmm. I tried running your code in a test game and I'm not actually _getting_ any error. It all worked fine.\r\n\r\nIf I recall \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\" basically means you've told Quest to access an object that does not exist. It usually happens with typos: Talk to BobObject as opposed to BboObject. It can even happen if you mispell an attribute: If you have Bob.Anger, but instead call Bob.Angry, the game will look for attribute Bob.Angry, not find it, then look for _object_ Bob.Angry, not find that either, and throw the error.\r\n\r\nBut I can't actually see what's wrong with it. Is this your entire code, or is there something else that might be screwing with Bob's part?",
