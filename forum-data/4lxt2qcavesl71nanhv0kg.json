So, roughly, that could mean: 10% *, 20% **, 40% ***, 20% ****, 10% *****. That is probably how I'm rating games, and mostly only playing the top band through to completion.

In these cases, my reviews have been based on what the games should be when the glitches are removed (4.5 rounded up to 5!). \r\n\r\nI think that most people who post games here are trying hard and certainly putting in considerable time for no payment.
