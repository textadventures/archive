There's a door open in front of you.\n\nWAIT FOR 2 SECONDS\n\nOpen the door (link to page 2)\n\nWAIT FOR 2 SECONDS\n\nLeave this place (link to page 3)\n\nThe wait for 2 seconds part doesn't seem to work, there is no script such as &quot;Wait for ...&quot;, alike RPG Maker's one. What is the point of showing the 2 options before the introduction is over ? I want these two options displayed ONLY after the description is finished. I tried with flags (set flag on after the introduction, make an if condition for the choices to appear, it told me that there was an invalid attribute name... I know how those work, but it's definely broken in Text Adventure). I looked for timers, can't find'em in gamebook mode...\n\nCan anybody help me ? This piece of software isn't handy at all.. thanks",
