      "EditableText": "I'm thinking out loud here so no idea whether it would work. You could have the 'read book' command start a script which moves the player object to a room called 'reading book' where you disable the parser and use the text processor only. Like a minigame. Every entry will have a flag so in the If script you start with the notebook filled and whittle your way backwards to the flag with one entry. Each flag would lead to links for further pages as and when they're discovered. You'd also need to include a link to 'stop reading book' which would return the player back to the room they were in. I have no idea how to implement that last bit. With my limited knowledge I'd have to make the book stationary for it to work rather than an inventory object. I'm sure the coders could send you back to the right room though.\n\nI'm experimenting with a book as a hint system. Basically every area in the game will apply a different flag to the book which will give a different entry based on the flag. So just reading the book will give information based on where the player is. And that is also discoverable not implicit.",
