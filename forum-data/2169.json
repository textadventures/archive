Create an exit from room1 -&gt; room2, but do [b:1d56xlli]not[/b:1d56xlli] &quot;automatically create exit in other direction&quot;.\n4) Select room2 and select the &quot;Exits&quot; tab. Create a script for the corresponding exit from room2 -&gt; room1. Edit the script.\n5) Add a conditional that checks to see if a flag is set. Call the flag &quot;player_has_light&quot;. In the &quot;Then&quot; clause, put a print message script and make sure the text is really long. Don't put anything in the &quot;Else&quot; clause. Add another line to the script below the conditional\n6) Make this script also print a long message (something soppy about the player dying.)\n7) Add another line to the script, and select &quot;Game Control | End the game by making the player lose&quot;\n8) Close out the script\n9) Save the &quot;game&quot;.\n10) Exit QDK Pro 4.1\n11) Relaunch QDK Pro 4.1 and load the &quot;game&quot; you just created.\n12) Select room2 and select the &quot;Exits&quot; tab. Now try to look at the script for the exit to room1. Oops!! Only an opening-curly-brace shows up\n13) If - heaven forbid - you actually try to edit this defective script, you get into an infinite loop of dialog boxes reporting an error.\n\nSetup:\nWinXP (SP2) box w/512 MB RAM and 20+ GB HD space.\n32MB Nvidia TNT 64 3D video card\n\nRepeatability:\nalways (for me, anyway - don't have any other machines to test this on.)\n\nWork-around:\nNone - yet.",
