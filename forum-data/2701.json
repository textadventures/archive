I tried using switches, but I don't find them as versatile yet as the If statements, on account of the drop down menu.  Also, sometimes I'd open an if and it will close the program, telling me that a variable was undefined before I even enter something. Due to my newness, I'm not certain if this is a 5.01 or 5.0 problem.",
