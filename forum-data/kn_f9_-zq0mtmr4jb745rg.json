As the title suggests, I chose to create an account using my google account and I use 4 or 5 different devices to log in to this site (at home, on the go, friends home). The following problem occurs constantly: \r\n\r\nWhen I'm logged off and click to log in (the purple button on the top right) I get asked how to log in, I choose Google. My 2 accounts are shown, I click the first one as usual and I'm asked for my password. I click confirm and instead of loggin me in it puts me back to my 2 Google accounts to choose from. And so it repeats itself over and over again. I deleted all my browser data, passwords, autofill, etc etc. closed Chrome, reopend, tried again to log in and it works. I don't get it. \r\nI use my Google accounts on several different sites, everythings fine, except here. I don't want to keep deleting all my browserdata everytime I use a different device to have access to use the forum properly.\r\n\r\nIf anyone maybe had the same trouble, found a solution i really would like to hear/read it, please.
