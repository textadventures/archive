I have all my tutorial locations inside a directory/room called Tut, which are separated into 4 additional child directories within Tut. The offending part of my current code is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntutLocations = GetAllChildObjects (Tut)\r\nif (player.parent = tutLocations) {\r\n  if (player.hitpoints <= 0) {\r\n    player.hitpoints = 1\r\n    msg (\"That should have killed you...\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is not the full code. I omitted the \"else\" portion of the code as I know that works. I know that the first line of code will create an objectlist containing all the children contained within Tut, but I'm not sure how to use that objectlist to check against player.parent. Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Do I need to be using a foreach loop to check all the objects in the list? I could keep messing around with it, but I figured I'd see if someone could tell me the \"right\" way to do it.",
