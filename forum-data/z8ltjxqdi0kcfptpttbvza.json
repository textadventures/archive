I have a game that works fine on this website, but what I'd like to do is embed it on a different page entirely. I've tried sticking it in an iframe, which just comes up with a blank screen, and I tried just uploading the files to itch.io and gamejolt both, neither of which allow scrolling. Is there anything I can do? I'd really rather not just link the game if I can avoid it.",
