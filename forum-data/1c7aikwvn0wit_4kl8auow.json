      "EditableText": "Hey y'all. :) Having some difficulty with nesting simple If statements, and I wasn't sure what the issue was. Here is my example (gamebook, offline):\r\n\r\n      if (HasSeenPage(Page2) && HasSeenPage(Page3)) {\r\n        msg (\"hello\")\r\n      }\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, this will exclusively print the message \"hello\" if, and only if, the player has seen Page2  _and_ Page3. It does not care if the Player sees one or the other, or neither, only both.\r\n\r\nThe other option (really prefered for what I am doing):\r\n\r\n    if (HasSeenPage(Page2)) {\r\n      \tif (HasSeenPage(Page3)) {\r\n        msg (\"hello\")\r\n      }\r\n      msg (\"goodbye\")\r\n      }\r\n\r\nThis will print \"hello\" both are true, but print \"goodbye\" if  _only_ the first is true, correct? I'm not very comfortable with nesting as looking at layers of code easily confuses me, so if someone could correct this then I'd really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
