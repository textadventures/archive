But now IM back and oh boy - lots of nice changes in the engine since 4.0 LOL\n\nHere is my question:\nI want to make a room that acts as a character initialization. I see the program has added a status feature - very nice. I set 3 stats, skill, stamina and luck. default is zero. When the game starts I want to up date those with a random number.\n\nThe random number part I get.\nWhat I dont get is where are those vars stored at? i tried name-&gt;object-&gt;player-&gt; but the list doest show the three stats mentioned above. I am sure I am going about this all wrong. so if someone canpoint me in the right dir.. that would be great.",
