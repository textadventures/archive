      "EditableText": "Played both.  Totaled four minutes of game time.  If possible... give a points out of at the end of the timed one.  What the heck does 42346 (or whatever) mean?  Is there a high score?  That would be helpful.  Also maybe preface it with a goal?  What's the goal?  Go as quick as possible?  Be thorough?  What do I need to do to score well?\n\nThe first one is just an exercise in programming I assume.  By classic puzzle, you weren't kidding.  And, maybe add in a lowest score possible note at the end?  To see how awesome I was when I won?  Try using quest to create a TA.  I'd be curious to see how you like it.",

      "EditableText": "Yeah, I warned you that they were short. xD Yes, an explanation of points or goal would be a good idea, but I kind of wanted to get the hurried/rushed feeling of how you might really be in the morning, especially if you snooze. So I guess all my explanation would come at the end.\n\nYou're precisely right. The puzzle one was the first time I'd programmed in JavaScript and I used it as an example for my students to show the kinds of things you could make with it.\n\nI'm planning on trying out quest, though I'm actually a programmer so I'll have to see how much flexibility it gives me. Might recommend it to my students if I like it. The one I&quot;m currently working on I'm just coding up. It's a lot more of a story-driven, half rpg, half escape-the-room.\n\nThanks so much for your feedback, I really appreciate it.",

The road blocks and limitations I'm running into is largely because I don't know coding well enough to fix my problems.  So, knowing code is hugely beneficial but not necessary.  I think you'll have success and enjoy using quest especially if you have a clue about code.  Also, don't hesitate to ask questions.  There are tons of knowledgeable  (not me!  lol) and helpful people on the site.  Good luck!",
