      "EditableText": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is probably a really simple question that has been asked before, but I can't find the answer on the boards.\n\nI'm just learning to use Quest, and I'm using the web based programming. I've been following the tutorial which gives instructions on how to create the command &quot;say __ to ___,&quot; allowing characters to interact with the player. However, if you create a character, it also has the option &quot;speak to&quot; selected when you hover over it, and if you select &quot;speak to&quot; you get the response &quot;___ says nothing.&quot; \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is there a way to get rid of the &quot;speak to&quot; option without making the character an object? \n2. Is there a way to make it so clicking &quot;speak to&quot; has the same result as typing &quot;say ___ to ___&quot;?\n\nThank you!!",
