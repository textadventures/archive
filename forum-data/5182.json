      "EditableText": "I've been playing with the mapping feature in Quest lately and came across some issues I haven't been able to find solutions for and figured I'd ask around.\n\nIt seems that under default settings the mapping functions don't play nice with unrealistic/impossible room layouts, and as an extension not working well with looping room sequences. The problem is that the map moves the player indicator exactly as your directional input would expect them to move without regards to the actual locations of the rooms. Then on top of that it will flat out stop drawing any room you enter a second time if the expected new location doesn't line up with the original location you encountered that room at.\n\nFor example, the setup I was playing with involves an L shaped hallway and 3 rooms, one at the corner and 1 at the end of each hallway. The end rooms have an up/down exit into eachother. When the player moves east initially then travels down , then north back to the intersection, they end up in the starting room, however on the map they are just north of the n/s facing hallway in a room that isn't displayed on the map, since the map is still showing this same room at the starting location. Then if you continue to follow the rooms forwards you end up way off the drawn map. Additionally after going up/down more than 3 times I start seeing errors telling me that the layer is out of bounds every time I move.\n\nHonestly I can work with this as a limitation if there is a way to essentially reset the map, as in clear everything and set the players position back to being 0, 0, 0.\n\n\nThe other odd thing I'm running into is with the map position offset of a room. For one this only seems to work when a room is a child of the base room, but the offset seems to be a one way effect, causing the player to become misaligned with their map quite easily, as you will move with the offset while move from parent to child room, but when moving back the player moves as if the parent room was connected normally to the exit back. And since a parent/child relationship is one way (to my understanding), there doesn't seem to be a way to resolve this without modifying the actual code that controls the player location on the map.\n\n\nUltimately what I'd like to be able to do is create a map that can be reused but may appear in different locations relative to where the player may be entering it on more than one occasion within the same playthrough. I can work with needing to assemble the rooms and their positions manually, but I do need to be able to keep the player aligned with the correct mapping position as well as be able to redraw a room a second time in a new location. Having to completely clear the map isn't an issue but I haven't been able to find any information on how to accomplish that.",
