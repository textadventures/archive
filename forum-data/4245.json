I've got a full attribute and level up/EXP system, battle system, etc. with just about all the kinks worked out.\n\nI'm having trouble with one issue, though.\n\nHow does Quest save games?  It's my understanding that it saves after every turn?  Is there a way to disable or change this?\n\nThis is a [b:kj9te7f7]necessity[/b:kj9te7f7] for me because if Quest saves after every turn, this means it will save during battles.  The player might end up in situations where they get stuck because they started a battle unprepared, or they simply made too many mistakes and can't win.\n\nI want to create save points instead.  The types of save points that you would find in a typical RPG.  How would I do that?\n\nThanks for any help!",
