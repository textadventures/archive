      "EditableText": "Gentlemen:\n\nStill struggling with the learning phase. I've created a house with several rooms on the 1st floor (Main Hall, Living Room, Study), an Upper Hallway and a Master Bedroom. Outside (basically on the 1st floor) there is a flowered path and a gravel path. I've tested the exits and there is no problem getting from one room to another and back.\n\nOn the flowered path I've set a flower. You can either pick or take the flower, in which case it becomes part of the player's inventory. Both those verbs work as planned.\n\nI created another verb: &quot;grab,&quot; for which I've written a simple script. If the player enters &quot;grab flower,&quot; the thing disintegrates and the player is &quot;teleported&quot; to another location. Herein lies the question. If, in the script, I teleport the player to any other 1st floor location (i.e. Main Hall, Living Room, Study or Gravel Path) there's no problem. However, if I script it so that the player is teleported to a 2nd-floor room (upper hallway or master bedroom) I get the following message when I play the game.\n\n\n&gt; grab flower\nYou grad the flower in your fist, but it disintergrates and disappears in a puff of smoke.
