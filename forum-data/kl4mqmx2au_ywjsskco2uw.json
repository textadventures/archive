      "EditableText": "Thanks @manowar, I understand that if my age is over 18, any game classified as 'adult' will be shown. However, there are a couple of problems here. Firstly, with the way that games are classified. For example,  a game can be a 'fantasy' OR 'work in progress' OR 'adult', when in reality all three may apply. Most of the games that I'm seeing are 'work in progress', with a description indicating that they are adult.  A second problem is that I may be over 18 but still not want to see adult material so perhaps an additional adult tick box would be useful?",

      "EditableText": "Sorry @jmnevil54, there isn't a simple workaround for this issue. A new account with a profile age less than 18 or no account at all is currently displaying adult material. The problem is that there are adult games on the site that are not classified as 'adult'. This may not be the fault of the games developers. The problem can probably be traced back to the fix Alex made to allow games developers to classify their games as 'work in progress' as and so bypass the review process where an 'adult' tag would have been added.\r\n\r\nIn relation to my mention of 'principles', these are ideas that everyone might support, and so give guidance to the design of the site. For example,\r\n1. Every adult game on the site will be clearly marked that way.\r\n2. Adult games will only be displayed to those logged in.\r\n3. Adult games will not be displayed to those with a profile age less than 18.\r\n\r\nThe proposal I made yesterday hides adult material without developers having to do anything. It is, of course, heavy handed! A more refined approach would be:\r\n1. modify the game submission form to include a question on the suitability of the game for under 18s, setting the adult rating accordingly.\r\n2. for games that have been voluntarily added to 'work in progress' or the 'sandpit' since the submission form was introduced, make them all adult. With (1) in place, the developers can go in and indicate that their games are not adult if that is the case.\r\n\r\nThat would allow a player to set their age less than 18 to avoid all adult material.

      "HTML": "<p>Sorry @jmnevil54, there isn't a simple workaround for this issue. A new account with a profile age less than 18 or no account at all is currently displaying adult material. The problem is that there are adult games on the site that are not classified as 'adult'. This may not be the fault of the games developers. The problem can probably be traced back to the fix Alex made to allow games developers to classify their games as 'work in progress' as and so bypass the review process where an 'adult' tag would have been added.</p>\n<p>In relation to my mention of 'principles', these are ideas that everyone might support, and so give guidance to the design of the site. For example,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Every adult game on the site will be clearly marked that way.</li>\n<li>Adult games will only be displayed to those logged in.</li>\n<li>Adult games will not be displayed to those with a profile age less than 18.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The proposal I made yesterday hides adult material without developers having to do anything.
