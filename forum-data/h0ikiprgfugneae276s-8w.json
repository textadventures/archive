So... sorry (and thanks!) in advance!\r\n\r\nBasic Plan:  Because there is NOT a ton of battles to be had and weapons are fairly limited (probably 4-5 total), I plan on placing a simple 'attack' verb on each monster.  In this script, I will use a flag setting system to check to see which weapon the player has equipped.  For each weapon If/Else If, there will be random chance Ifs nested within.  Example:  If 60%, then \"Great Attack!\", Else If 30% \"Good Attack.\", Else 10% \"Missed!\".  Obviously I've dumbed it down a bit, but...\r\n\r\nQuestion 1: Will this set-up work?  I think it will...\r\n\r\nQuestion 2:  I would like each successful attack to have a range of health points that get deducted.  I know I am being a code noob here, but I was thinking something like this:\r\n```\r\nif (GetBoolean(femur, \"femurequipped\")) {\r\n  msg (\"You swing the femur down at the fanged rat.\")\r\n  if (RandomChance(60)) {\r\n    msg (\"Your makeshift hammer catches the rat solidly in the head.  Good strike!\")\r\n    Fanged Rat.Health = Fanged Rat.Health - GetRandomInt(10-25)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nwhich obviously doesn't work.  I'd like to subtract the health in a range for each type of attack.  How do I code for subtracting a GetRandomInt range?",
