See, the long story is that I had a splint on my left hand that was causing all sorts of typing issues - my plastic palm was hitting the ctrl, the shift, and the microsoft button from time to time. I don't know what happened but the menu quit updating (I could see sections and play through them, but not in the menu view).\r\n\r\nIn the end, I went back to a version before I'd been splinted and reestablished that as my baseline. Then I dumped the newest version into word and cut and pasted each new section across. \r\n\r\nIt was a very methodical process that got squiffy running again. But yes, it was pretty weird. Couldn't solve it directly.\r\n\r\nThank goodness the splint is off.",
