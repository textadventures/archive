You need to include this JS file in your game file. The pane is created automatically when this file is included.\n2) InvPane2.aslx - This file contains an ASLX function you can call to set the list contents. You need to include this library in your game file. There are two functions:\n   - SetInventory2Label: Call this function, passing the new label as a string, to set the pane's label (the text at the top)\n   - SetInventory2: Call this function, passing an object list, to set the objects into the pane.\n3) AdditionalPane.aslx - This is a sample test game file that shows the second pane in operation. You don't need this file in your game.\n\nThe list is set up to work the same as the standard inventory pane. Clicking on an object shows the verbs available. Also, you *must* call SetInventory2 to set or update the pane list contents as desired. This is a separate pane and will not be updated automatically. (A way to do this is to use a turn script.)",

If its too hard to create an entirely new pane then players (and myself) can deal with the time being in the status pane as its not game changing lol. Thanks for your help though, I may end up using this for the time and other things.",
