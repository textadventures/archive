      "EditableText": "let me properly introduce myself <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) -->\n\nI've been wanting to learn to code and learn game making, and found quest, I've been here for about 3 years now, slowly trying to learn to code and to make games, but it's a slow process as work takes up most of my time (I come home too exhuasted to do further work: learning to code more or work on making a game), sighs.\n\nI'm very opinionated (though, I try not to be, wasted too much of my younger years debating online... then realizing that debating with idiots is really a big waste of time, seriously), I'm actually quite smart and am a huge nerd, loving ALL science fields, I watch tons of educational shows, news, and am interested in politics and world events (been so, ever since I turned 19, I just all of a sudden became interested in news~world events~politics, lol, when priorly, I wasn't really that interested at all). I was really good at math and science up through high school, but then I realized I really weren't interested in those as carreers (I hated doing boring 6 hr science labs, that with my clumsiness, could never do right, laughs), and math was getting too hard for me (applications of calculus, and~or I was just getting too lazy, and sick of school work, and with math... you need to do that homework... to really get it in your head for when the test comes). Took more of an interest in human behavior sciences, and I never really knew what I wanted to do for a carreer, so I really wasted a huge chunk of my life taking classes for no benefit for me for a carreer~job~future. I went into history as a major, as I had to choose some major, as I still had no idea what I wanted to do, but I learned that 'liking history, liking to read about history', is NOT the same thing as being the one to have to actually research, read, and write papers upon paper upon papers, with an abysmal prospect: be a teacher, a museum curator, or an archeologist (if you like to dig and adventure~travel), oh, or being a lawyer (but really history is just taken by lawyers to be better lawyers, not by historians, who then decide to go into law, lol). YUCK, I was hugely turned off by history as a career, hated it, and it was a total DEAD END, anyways. I did learn though to write really well though, laughs. I JUST HATE research, especially research papers, though... I love to just be able to free-write, to give my own thoughts about something, as that's really better than pretending to write an 'objective research paper', when you're really just pushing a biased political agenda upon the populace. The secret truth: people write and find 'facts', that they want to find and write about.\n\nSo... I needed to find a real carreer... and I've been frustrated with not knowing anything about computers and paying huge amounts of money to get my computer cleaned of viruses, so I'm like why not go into computers, it's a wonderful carreer, having lots of real use and can live off of too. That's all true, but there's A LOT to learn, sighs, lots of competition, and I'm at the bottom, those good jobs are still way out of my reach, but it is a carreer... hopefully, I can learn enough to get a good~decent (livable) job, at some point before its too late, sighs. I wish I was a kid again, being born as a coding~computer genius, working at google at 12 years old, making millions... but alas, that sadly wasn't me, back when I was a kid... I'm old now, so I'm trying my best to catch up to everyone else.. but there's so much to learn with computers... sighs, and in being old... I'm not learning as quickly as I could when younger, even though I am generally a quick learner, I'm noticing the age factor in learning, sighs.\n\nanyways, I got some job now... not a livable wage (part time of course, as there is NO full time jobs in the US, thanks to Obama Care!), but a wage, and at least a foot in the door, my first job in computers... now I just need to try to find time to learn more, so I can advance and find a better job... while still working at the job I have now (as it took me 9 months to get this job... I'm uber fearful of quiting... and not being able to get another job, laughs. The US economy and job-market is abysmal in reality for us 'non-well-off' people, sighs. And fewer and fewer jobs are available too, between globalization of cheap labor in other countries losing jobs in this country, hard working smart foreigners coming here taking up the good jobs here, and illegal immigrants from mexico taking up the lower jobs here too, there's literally like NO~ZERO jobs left for US citizens in the US, sighs. All for $@%#^#$% politicians getting votes for their party and staying in their lush 'elysium' life as politicians~congressman~senators~executive administration~etc). Anyways... let's see... I love gaming (electronic and board), I did like playing sports (soccer~world football, baseball, american football~rugby with pads) when I was young, I love stories, so I love to read (well, when I was younger I read galore, but now I don't read at all), watching tv, movies, anime, manga, and etc. I love sci-fi and fantasy for genres, and I 99% of the time, HATE comedy, it's so beneath me, I'm a smart nerd, so I just can't stand comedy (99% of the time), really the only reason I watch comedy at all is merely for its fanservice scenes, laughs. What else... I'm a decent chess player, not at the professional~competitive level obviously (I can't play fast at all, lol), but I'm not bad at chess for an amatuer player.\n\noh... if you haven't realized by now... I like to write... write a lot... I'm the opposite of a twitter'er, I'm a verbose writer... blame that on my history classes, laughs. Concise is not in my vocabulary, laughs.

      "HTML": "let me properly introduce myself <!-- s;) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s;) --><br/><br/>I've been wanting to learn to code and learn game making, and found quest, I've been here for about 3 years now, slowly trying to learn to code and to make games, but it's a slow process as work takes up most of my time (I come home too exhuasted to do further work: learning to code more or work on making a game), sighs.<br/><br/>I'm very opinionated (though, I try not to be, wasted too much of my younger years debating online... then realizing that debating with idiots is really a big waste of time, seriously), I'm actually quite smart and am a huge nerd, loving ALL science fields, I watch tons of educational shows, news, and am interested in politics and world events (been so, ever since I turned 19, I just all of a sudden became interested in news~world events~politics, lol, when priorly, I wasn't really that interested at all). I was really good at math and science up through high school, but then I realized I really weren't interested in those as carreers (I hated doing boring 6 hr science labs, that with my clumsiness, could never do right, laughs), and math was getting too hard for me (applications of calculus, and~or I was just getting too lazy, and sick of school work, and with math... you need to do that homework... to really get it in your head for when the test comes). Took more of an interest in human behavior sciences, and I never really knew what I wanted to do for a carreer, so I really wasted a huge chunk of my life taking classes for no benefit for me for a carreer~job~future. I went into history as a major, as I had to choose some major, as I still had no idea what I wanted to do, but I learned that 'liking history, liking to read about history', is NOT the same thing as being the one to have to actually research, read, and write papers upon paper upon papers, with an abysmal prospect: be a teacher, a museum curator, or an archeologist (if you like to dig and adventure~travel), oh, or being a lawyer (but really history is just taken by lawyers to be better lawyers, not by historians, who then decide to go into law, lol). YUCK, I was hugely turned off by history as a career, hated it, and it was a total DEAD END, anyways. I did learn though to write really well though, laughs. I JUST HATE research, especially research papers, though... I love to just be able to free-write, to give my own thoughts about something, as that's really better than pretending to write an 'objective research paper', when you're really just pushing a biased political agenda upon the populace. The secret truth: people write and find 'facts', that they want to find and write about.<br/><br/>So... I needed to find a real carreer... and I've been frustrated with not knowing anything about computers and paying huge amounts of money to get my computer cleaned of viruses, so I'm like why not go into computers, it's a wonderful carreer, having lots of real use and can live off of too. That's all true, but there's A LOT to learn, sighs, lots of competition, and I'm at the bottom, those good jobs are still way out of my reach, but it is a carreer... hopefully, I can learn enough to get a good~decent (livable) job, at some point before its too late, sighs. I wish I was a kid again, being born as a coding~computer genius, working at google at 12 years old, making millions... but alas, that sadly wasn't me, back when I was a kid... I'm old now, so I'm trying my best to catch up to everyone else.. but there's so much to learn with computers... sighs, and in being old... I'm not learning as quickly as I could when younger, even though I am generally a quick learner, I'm noticing the age factor in learning, sighs.<br/><br/>anyways, I got some job now... not a livable wage (part time of course, as there is NO full time jobs in the US, thanks to Obama Care!), but a wage, and at least a foot in the door, my first job in computers... now I just need to try to find time to learn more, so I can advance and find a better job... while still working at the job I have now (as it took me 9 months to get this job... I'm uber fearful of quiting... and not being able to get another job, laughs. The US economy and job-market is abysmal in reality for us 'non-well-off' people, sighs. And fewer and fewer jobs are available too, between globalization of cheap labor in other countries losing jobs in this country, hard working smart foreigners coming here taking up the good jobs here, and illegal immigrants from mexico taking up the lower jobs here too, there's literally like NO~ZERO jobs left for US citizens in the US, sighs. All for $@%#^#$% politicians getting votes for their party and staying in their lush 'elysium' life as politicians~congressman~senators~executive administration~etc). Anyways... let's see... I love gaming (electronic and board), I did like playing sports (soccer~world football, baseball, american football~rugby with pads) when I was young, I love stories, so I love to read (well, when I was younger I read galore, but now I don't read at all), watching tv, movies, anime, manga, and etc. I love sci-fi and fantasy for genres, and I 99% of the time, HATE comedy, it's so beneath me, I'm a smart nerd, so I just can't stand comedy (99% of the time), really the only reason I watch comedy at all is merely for its fanservice scenes, laughs. What else... I'm a decent chess player, not at the professional~competitive level obviously (I can't play fast at all, lol), but I'm not bad at chess for an amatuer player.<br/><br/>oh... if you haven't realized by now... I like to write... write a lot... I'm the opposite of a twitter'er, I'm a verbose writer... blame that on my history classes, laughs. Concise is not in my vocabulary, laughs. (my teachers hated me, whatever paper assignment I was given, I'd always at least double the maximum page limit, 10 page assignment, I'd write at least 20 pages and I would have to make it single spaced despite it being required to be double spaced ~ hey if it was double-spaced it would be 40 pages long!, laughs... ya my teachers hated me, but they still gave me A's, lol)<br/><br/>I love animals (well only some, I could care less about cows, but dogs... wolfs... and etc cool animals, I love), am a huge animal nerd (remember I LOVE ALL science fields), though I don't find others to talk about animal stuff, lol.
