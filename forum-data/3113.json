Using HTML has only given me errors.\n\nAlso, is it possible to have background music in gamebook games?\n\n(I realize that if I made the game a text adventure, there is a way to disable command inputs altogether which would probably give me more flexibility, but I'm a total noob and I have no idea how to do that, if that is my only option. However, for simplicity's sake I'd prefer to stick with gamebook mode, if possible.)",
