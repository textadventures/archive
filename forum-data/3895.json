      "EditableText": "Hi Everyone, I'm OhmSweetOhm, a Quest newbie!\n\nPlease forgive me if this has been asked before before, but can anyone tell me how I can add verbs for the use command for a particular object.\n\nI have a button, and I want the player to be able to use the commands 'use' 'press' or 'push'.  Only with the button should the the other two verbs be able to be used instead of 'use'.  I'm also not wanting the new verbs to appear in the sidebar... perhaps one of them, but not both.\n\nMany thanks!",

Click the &quot;Functions&quot; button on the tree, and make a new function. Name it &quot;buttonfunction&quot; and leave the parameters empty. Put whatever you want in the script.\n\nIn the use script, double click the script that says &quot;Call function&quot; and type in &quot;buttonfunction&quot;. Do the same for the two verbs.\n\nTo remove a verb, go the the Object tab, and under the Verbs list remove a verb.",

I am simply setting the flag for the object 'button' to 'on'\n\nI can add the verbs 'push' and 'press' in the object verb menu and set the same script, but the verbs still appear as separate verbs in the object's pane.\n\nI did it your way and set a function but all that appears to do is add another layer of code.  What I really want to do, is effectively hide the other verbs.  It's quite intuitive to type &quot;press button&quot; when you see a button, as opposed to 'use button' but it looks messy in the side pane with three or four verbs in there that all do the same thing.  Is there any way you know of that I can hide them?\n\nMany thanks again!",
