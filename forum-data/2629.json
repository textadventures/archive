Whenever you pick up an item it increases the numeric variable &quot;inventory&quot; by 1, and when you drop/lose it decreases by 1. What I dont want however is the variable inventory actually showing, because I feel it shouldn't be there and I already have quite a few variables in my game (health, mana, skills etc) so I am trying to reduce, variable clutter. \n\nIf this isn't possible are there any other suggestions at how I could go about this?
