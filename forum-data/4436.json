      "EditableText": "So...I literally just started playing with game creation and I'm trying to test out the features. I wanted room images in a static frame above the text, so I clicked the appropriate box in the game features to do so, and then chose a picture for the first room I was testing. I seem to have already gotten locked up in game creation. When I hit &quot;play&quot; only part of the image was visible and I was utterly unable to scroll down to see any of the text below the image. I tried to delete the image but didn't see any sort of option available to do so. I then went back to features to uncheck the image box in hopes of making it go away that way, but in game play the partial image with no ability to scroll down to the text was still there.\n\nAlso, in the room description it posted the description that I wrote, then immediately after that it arbitrarily showed the room title. So it's like, &quot;You are in a blue room...etc, etc, etc. A Blue Room.&quot; Is there a way to make that not do that?\n\nNormally I'm much better at figuring these things out, so it seems odd to me that I got stuck within five minutes of game creation. I'm using Chrome on a Mac if that makes a difference at all. Otherwise, what the hell am I doing wrong with this thing? I thought I was toying with the easy parts of game creation, lol.",

      "EditableText": "I'm in the text adventure builder.\n\nIn tinkering for myself it seems the issue is that you can't have the map feature turned on while also having the static picture feature turned on unless you want to size your pictures very small, more like a signature banner size. Game creators, perhaps this is something that should be mentioned in a tutorial, along with size specs for said limitations in picture size...\n\nAlso, I still can't seem to make the picture go away. There's no option to just delete an image once it's been selected. I can change it all day long, but I can't get rid of it, even when I go back and turn off the static picture feature in the game settings. That means to make it go away the only thing I can do is delete the entire room and start over again, which is frankly a huge waste of my time.\n\nIn fact, I've spent far more time just trying to figure out this glitchy image system than I have in actual game design, which is a definite negative against using this program. I'm testing softwares for a huge project in a rising production company and thus far I'm not exactly impressed. We wanted an easy-to-create text adventure platform but we want it to be fairly image heavy, so I need to be able to utilize the graphics features without a bunch of hassle. Maybe it's less glitchy in the downloadable version, but my teammates are spread out all over the country. I need them to be able to log in and make edits as necessary, but that's going to be difficult to do if I can't even figure out the program for myself. Adding images should be the least difficult thing to do, I would think.",
