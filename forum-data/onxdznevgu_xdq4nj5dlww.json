For a while now, I have wanted to make a Choice of Game or a textadventure but I've never completely understood the coding and language for it, so I thought I'd give this a shot... I'm looking for a writing partner to help me put a game out there.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of ideas and I'm willing to work for this to happen, even if it doesn't get much recognition from the community. I'm not looking for someone who is especially literate in coding and other computer wizardry. Should we hit it off, perhaps we could make some more adventures together and grow as a team?\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested, hit me up.",
