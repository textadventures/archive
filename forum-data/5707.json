So if you create a rock. It would be referred to as your rock.object. So in this case, you have your character Ole Miss Riley. She is Ole Miss Riley.object. So go to Ole Miss Riley, and click her &quot;object tab&quot;. At the bottom you'll see, &quot;Display Verbs&quot; and a list next to it. You have two options...\n1. Click the small box, &quot;Only Display Verbs from this object's Verb Tab&quot; ((which is what you added the &quot;Speak to&quot; verb to. \nOr\n2. You can add &quot;Speak to&quot; ((same spelling required)) to that &quot;Display Verb List&quot; \n\nNow either way you won't be able to type &quot;Speak to&quot;, the player will have to click her, and then select her &quot;Speak to&quot; verb and it'll activate the conversation. Try that!\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to try some coding Start with simple things. For example, click &quot;code view&quot; next to that &quot;Run Script&quot; thing, and it should show you an isolated part of the code that has to do with the &quot;Speak to&quot; thing. Now you'll see this...\n\nmsg (&quot;Conversation spoken here!&quot;)\n\nnow try hitting enter so that you are below that and write this exactly...\n\nmsg (&quot;&quot;) \n\nthen unclick code view and you should have a new blank message box below your existing one <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

Drag him in another room you want to see and play again.  The rooms are labeled like 'standard NPC room', 'showing images room', 'If Then room simple', 'If Then room Complex', 'Flag Setting Unsetting Room'.  You just have to search the room you are looking for in the 'tree of stuff' on the left and drag Magoo into it.\n\nI can send you the .aslx file over a PM or email if you wish, just know that it is not near completion.  It does have a lot of the basics in it - like naming objects, talking to NPCs, using flags, using If/Then scripts, fancy output, edibles, commands, etc.  Other things I have added as I see common problems on the forum.
