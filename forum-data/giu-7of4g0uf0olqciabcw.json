I did this and several several months later received an email to say it had now been fixed.\r\n\r\nI'm now considering having another attempt at making a small, traditional TA in Quest, but wanted to check the save/resume issue before I put any work in, and find that nothing has changed. I hide the border and background for the input box in my games, but on resume of a save the CSS isn't being read and the input box border pops up in a glaring white.\r\n\r\nIn that Alex doesn't appear to be bothering with Quest these days, does anyone have any idea where we are on this bug? Failing that, how I get hold of Alex? ",
