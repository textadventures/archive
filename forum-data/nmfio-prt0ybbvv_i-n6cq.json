I just get a blank screen.  (I don't think the built-in Chromium browser can have more than one window running.)\r\n\r\nSo, in the desktop player, try this on for size:\r\n```JS.eval (\"var myWindow  = $('#gameBorder');$('#status, #gamePanes').css('position','absolute');myWindow.dialog({height: 600, width: 1000});\")```\r\n\r\n---\r\nBack to online play:\r\n\r\nWhen I play online, I click 'Play' (either from the editor or from a game's main page), and the game opens in a new tab.\r\n\r\nNow, if the game is in a window of its own, you can do ```JS.eval (\"window.resizeTo(400,400);\")```, and your actual game's window *will* resize.\r\n\r\n---\r\nConfused?\r\n\r\nBecause I'm not sure if I am or not...",
