Marvelous by the way, but I hit a snag when it comes to the health.\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is give the player a warning when their health reaches a certain point (&lt; 10) but I can't figure out how to reference the default code for player health. I've see a lot of work arounds for this by adding health as an attribute for the player, however doing so pretty much invalidates every easy to use script feature involving the default health which would be a problem for me since I'll need to be changing health a lot during the game.\n\nDoes anyone know how to reference the default health value that the game uses? Is it even possible?",
