You can override Quest's standard error messages using \"error\" tags in the \"define game\" block, or if you're using QDK, by going to the Text menu and selecting Standard Messages.\n\nFor the player to be able to type in German commands, you just need to set the relevant commands up, using \"command\" tags if you're coding by hand, or in QDK by going to Game &gt; Properties &gt; Global Settings &gt; Edit Custom Player Commands.\n\nQuest 3.5, which will be available soon, will provide a way for you to translate Quest's menus and windows as well.\n\nIf you can come up with a German translation of Quest, I'd be really interested to see it.",
