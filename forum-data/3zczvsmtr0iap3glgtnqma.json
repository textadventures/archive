The game I'm building is heavy on images, somewhat similar to the infocom Hitchhiker's Guide game,  and I've played around with the display settings a bit but I've come to realize it would look much better if I could have the text parser and all subsequent text on the right side of the screen and display images on the left. Any advice on how to do this? I realize I'll probably have to do some genuine code work which is why I mentioned I only have minimal experience with the Python language before.",
