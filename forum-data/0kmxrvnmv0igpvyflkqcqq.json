I had no idea. I just forgot a little thing, but it is completely fixed now, so, enjoy the game. You no longer have to download it, turn it into a zip file, and delete the start script in the game tab. Again, my apologies to everyone who had wanted to play as soon as it came out and didn't know where player was, or why. I guess that is what they mean when they say \"mystery\".  \r\n\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/pxccddtidkuliax1vqxl4w/thalassas-thicket\r\n",
