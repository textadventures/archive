You could only print out plain-looking text one time.  (No game.)\r\n\r\nIf you only learned CSS, you'd have no HTML to stylize with your CSS.  So, that would be a waste of time.\r\n\r\nIf you only learned JS, you'd have no HTML to manipulate. (NOTE: You *could* use your JS skills in NodeJS or Deno apps, but each of those apps would need to be downloaded and ran as stand-alone apps. They would be severely less universally accessible than a website (made with HTML, CSS, and JS).  Plus, you couldn't post the apps on this site.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe good news is that you most probably already know much more HTML, CSS, and JS than you realize.  I opine this because you've been using Quest for so long, and Quest is basically a glorified browser that only loads Quest games.  It displays HTML, and we use CSS and JS to manipulate that HTML in our games.",
