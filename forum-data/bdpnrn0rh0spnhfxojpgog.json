Although when I did a game with a \"get out\" or \"leave\" command, I used alternate command scopes to put the object you're inside into scope (so that \"look cupboard\" is an alias for \"look\" when you're inside it; and \"leave cupboard\" behaves intuitively as an alias for the simple \"leave\").\r\n\r\nI would suggest that if you're doing it that way, the leave command could be changed to:\r\n```\r\nif (HasScript (game.pov.parent, \"leave\")) {\r\n  do (game.pov.parent, \"leave\")\r\n}\r\nelse if (HasScript (game.pov.parent, \"getinto\")) {\r\n  MoveObject (game.pov, game.pov.parent.parent)\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"What are you getting out of?\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat way, it will work for any object that has a \"get into\" verb, without needing to change the get out command if you want to add another one. And in this case, you can give an object a \"leave\" script attribute if you want to stop them climbing out of it so easily.",
