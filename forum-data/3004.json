I'm making one right know called the Treasure of Valhandra and I have a few questions about it…\n\nSo, I have a pretty basic quest scenario where the player is standing in front of a gate and must interact in a specific way with the guard blocking the gate so that the player can pass through the gate. I'm not entirely sure how I can pull off this scenario even after looking through help files and the tutorial. Specifically, my questions are …\n\n[b:3jo3bfec][size=150:3jo3bfec]1[/size:3jo3bfec]. How do I block and un-block an exit [i:3jo3bfec]conditionally[/i:3jo3bfec]?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nMeaning, how do I make an exit blocked until the player enters a certain command? For example, a player is in front of the gate but must KILL GUARD to pass through. Is that possible?\n[b:3jo3bfec][size=120:3jo3bfec]1[/size:3jo3bfec][size=110:3jo3bfec]a[/size:3jo3bfec]. Can I make an object react as though it has blocked an exit?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nSo, let's say a player is in front of a door, and must PUSH DOOR to pass through. Is it possible to have the player enter PUSH DOOR, then receive the message: [i:3jo3bfec]The door swings open, revealing an exit to the north[/i:3jo3bfec], while an exit to the north is un-blocked?\n\n[b:3jo3bfec][size=150:3jo3bfec]2[/size:3jo3bfec]. Is it possible for me to have the player interact with an object other than give/take/use/ask/tell?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nSo for example, could I make a command like EMBRACE &lt;OBJECT&gt; that would give the player the message: &quot;You embrace &lt;object&gt;?&quot;\nIf this question has been answered elsewhere like I expect, just refer me there ... I read something that sounded like it, but confused me to the point where I wasn't sure what exactly it was talking about. \n\n[b:3jo3bfec][size=150:3jo3bfec]3[/size:3jo3bfec]. Can I make the player die and restart?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nIf this question has been answered elsewhere like I expect, just refer me there.\n[b:3jo3bfec][size=120:3jo3bfec]3[/size:3jo3bfec][size=110:3jo3bfec]a[/size:3jo3bfec]. Can I make an object kill the player as a reaction to being attacked?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nSo, say the player tries to KILL ANT. Could I make the ant kill the player in response to that command?\n[b:3jo3bfec][size=120:3jo3bfec]3[/size:3jo3bfec][size=110:3jo3bfec]b[/size:3jo3bfec]. Can I make the player restart at a previous point in the quest instead of the very beginning?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nSo, if the player goes north twice, then dies in the second northern room, could I have them restart in the first northern room instead of the southernmost one they began in?\n\n[b:3jo3bfec][size=150:3jo3bfec]4[/size:3jo3bfec]. Could I transport a player to an exit without them typing the command to go there?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nFor example, the player SLEEPs, and receives the message: &quot;You fall into the dreamworld&quot;, then finds themselves in a completely different room than the one they began in, which would be a hidden, blocked exit from the first room? \n[b:3jo3bfec][size=150:3jo3bfec]4[/size:3jo3bfec][size=110:3jo3bfec]a[/size:3jo3bfec]. Could I make a player's command like DANCE let them reach a different room?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nSo, instead of NORTH making them go north, DANCE would have the same effect?\n\n[b:3jo3bfec][size=150:3jo3bfec]5[/size:3jo3bfec]. Can I hide objects [i:3jo3bfec]after[/i:3jo3bfec] the player has interacted with them?[/b:3jo3bfec]\nSo for example, if a player USEs a VASE, and they receive the resulting message: &quot;You accidentally drop the vase and it smashes into a million tiny pieces&quot;, could I have the object disappear in response to USE VASE? \n\nSorry about the question overload, I hope most of these haven't been answered somewhere else already <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> Thank you for helping!\n\n-Imagination",
