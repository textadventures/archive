      "EditableText": "So, I am working on a text adventure. I have tried multiple different things, but nothing, no objects, will work. In other words, when I try to 'look at' or 'take' anything, it will not work; it says that the object isn't found. I have tried linking objects, writing new verbs/scripts, and even deleting and recreating objects. The first paragraph/description or what not will show up and the objects do work, but once I try to do something with the specific object, it will not work for me. Does anyone know what to do to fix this?",
