Now, is it possible to save certain attributes and transfer it to another game altogether? And furthermore, while I'm here, and forgive me if I interpreted, but how does the update function work (ver. 1, ver. 2, etc.) Could I have an unfinished adventure published (unfinished meaning, will be added onto later... that was probably obvious huh)?",

You could, for example, write a function that stores all of the characters information in a password that could be used to transfer the character between games. That would be very complex to do, but it would work.",
