I mean the 'drop' command, for example, could easily be set up as a regular expression too, or is it just personal choice?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am only guessing, but... Behind the scenes it is all done with regular expressions, so they must have been implemented pretty much from the start (I am talking about during the development of Quest 5). It seems like HELP was implemented then, as an easy command to test it worked. Later the alternative of command pattern was added.</p>\n\n",
