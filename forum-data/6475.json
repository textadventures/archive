      "EditableText": "Sorry if i am writing at the wrong place, but occurred to me to be the most adequate at the moment,\n\nI met Quest for the first time, perhaps three years by now, and recently i begun a test project working on a parser game - not my favorite over game books, i confess - in order to test tools and coding. The intention is not just test something, but test the experience of making a full, ble to be published game.\n\nThe first thing i should note in this open letter is the quality - not only of skill and knowledge, but also as human beings - of the Quest forum members. Sounds a little unfair citing names, however feels even more unfair not recognizing Pixie's, HK's and Jaynabonne's efforts o commenting, clarify, council, discuss and even disagree on topics here. They do this as if they were working here. I can see a true dedication, if not using the word &quot;love&quot; to Interactive Fiction, writing and game designing.\n\nBut what really motivated me on writing this thread - or Open Letter, as i called it - came after a few tests on Quest tool There are many odd situations where i found Quest was pretty prepared to deal with. Many user friendly resources. Many &quot;self-solving-problems&quot; systems. It is not another tool. It is a powerful tool. And it is free.\n\nI imagine the amount of effort, nights solving troubles-shootings, researches, coding, buying new tools, investigating other tools for comparison and many others tactics in order to make it the way it is now, and even keep improving Quest. A full design compromise on something to be distributed for free, so everyone could dream stories and share it into a small - but steady - community.\n\nI decided taking some time to publicly say &quot;Thank you&quot;. Thank you for the powerful tool and thank you for sharing it with us.\n\nI am not sure if i will be able to someday, finally publish something nor if any game i design will be somehow appreciated by someone. But i am glad i have ways to give form what i dream about.",
