      "EditableText": "This is easy. The character's inventory believe it or not is actually a room called inventory. Just move the object from #quest.currentroom# to room name \"inventory\" to \"get\" an item into the player's inventory, or move it out of room \"inventory\" and into #quest.currentroom# to \"drop\" it. You do not need to actually create a room in your game called \"inventory\" to do this. It's a built-in room object. (Found this info basically in the help files somewhere in the QDK I think). In the QDK you probably will have to manually type in the word \"inventory\" as I don't think it shows up in the pulldown pick list as an actual room, even though it is a room. \n\nOr in the QDK there is an inventory selection category for giving and taking items to/from the player.",

Then you can loop through the room objects to list the inventory, etc. \n\nIn the QDP the script command editor window has a section called \"Game Control\" and when you expand that section there is a selection to \"Run a script for each object in a room.\" Click that and select the room name that you're calling your NPC inventory. Then you could do whatever... like a print statement with #quest.thing# to list each item in the room (i.e. inventory), or check if #quest.thing# is equal to the object you're looking for. (By the way #quest.thing# is not a made up name. It's the pointer you would always use in a room loop to reference the current object in the list). \n\nThe other way to do this of course is in a customized array, but that's kind of messy (in my opinion) when you can just use a room object and all the built in functionality that goes along with room objects.\n\nAnd if you do a customized get or put command to move objects from an NPC to the player, to notify the player that you did it you just do a print statement (i.e. MSG &lt;whatever&gt;) like:\n   [code:3ghzz9qc]\n   #&#40;NPC_name&#41;&#58;prefix# #@NPC_name# gave you #&#40;quest&#46;thing&#41;&#58;prefix# #@quest&#46;thing#\n   [/code:3ghzz9qc]",
