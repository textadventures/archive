After every 15 turns, an attribute switches from morning to noon, from noon to afternoon, etc.  I have different NPC's that come and go and events that happen when the time of day changes.  So far so good.\n\nMy question is this:\n\nI have an NPC (a Juju Man) that has some interesting articles he carries with him - a staff and his outfit.  I want the player to be able to look at each of those because there are clues hidden within their description.  So, when the Juju Man moves from his shack to the cemetery, for example, I want those items to move with him.  I realize I could make the Juju a container, but then when he is looked at, I would have an awkward &quot;on which there is&quot; response (I know I can change that to whatever) or a &quot;He is a Juju Man (who is carrying a staff and an outfit) - or something like that.  Right?  I don't want that awkwardness.  \n\nSo, my current set-up is to create two separate objects that I script to move with him when he goes from place to place.  When the time of day changes, I move Juju Man, outfit, and staff to needed location.  On the outfit and staff description, I have an 'If' script that checks to see if the Juju man is visible first.  Is there a problem with this and is there a better solution?  I have multiple NPCs I need to set up.\n\nThanks in advance.",
