I set everything up, click play, and it starts, but half way through the loading sequence, it comes up with a message box all in black, except the title and the outline of the ok button.  The title says \"Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library Error\".  I press ok, and the program ends.  Does anyone have any ideas as to why this may be happening?",
