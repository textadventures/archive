      "EditableText": "Right. So I wrote out a game a while back. It's actually mostly finished, and all ready to be published and everything. It's just that there's this glitch that keeps happening, that at a certain point seems to separate the player from the \"player\" object and removes their items from their inventory, essentially rendering the game unwinnable. I'm going to really try and get the sequence of events in order, to see if there isn't something I'm missing:\r\n\r\nSo the first step is that the player uses a bed, has himself a dream sequence (here the player object changes from the player to an alternate version of the player, with a separate inventory). The player does a few things while in this dream sequence and then, after flags are set, the game is arranged so that he's supposed to be sent right back to the original room and switched over to the original player the moment he passes from one room to another. What winds up happening instead is that they're sent back to the original room, their inventory is missing, and there's a new object called \"player\" in the room (which, incidentally, is not the name given to either of the player objects) which I can only _assume_ is where all the items have gone to. \r\n\r\nNaturally, I've tried changing around the order in which actions are performed when the player passes through the doorway, on the off chance that fixes things, but it doesn't. Furthermore, I can't do anything with this \"player\" object since, in the editor, it doesn't even exist; it's this bizarre artifact of the glitch where the game just seems to generate it out of thin air. At least, I'm assuming it's a glitch, and I haven't done some astronomically bone-headed oversight. Any kind of suggestions on what to try or where my attention should be would be pretty greatly appreciated.",

I assume your actual player character does not have the name 'player', but is rather an object you created with a given name.  When you switched the 'player' object to your created player, any script you have referring the original player cannot be completed as the code is searching for object 'player'.  You'll want to check that stuff as weird bugs will appear if you ever run into a reference that no longer exists.\r\n\r\nExample:  if I begin with an object I label as 'dog' and run scripts referencing object 'dog', all is good.  But if I go back and decide to change the name of object 'dog' to 'Fido', all scripts referencing dog will result an an error like the one you're seeing.  What I would do (take that with a grain of salt), is search in code view for 'player' and identify the scripts where this object name is referenced.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is where you encounter the error if I understand you correctly.  I've been plenty wrong before though.  Lol\r\n\r\nGood luck.",
