Hi to anyone that remembers me.\nAnyways, i ve been working hard programming and coming up with little games but all th ewhile i've been working on scripts and things for my newest game which is going to be in the style of the Broken Sword series. I originally wanted to make it a point and click game, but i cant find the a piece of software appropiate, i am not too good at programming so i was looking at AGS whichi s apparantly very good but i dont understand it at all. So anyway, i came to the decision i would make it a graphical text game, so hello again to Quest. I have just ebgun work on the game so expect a demo in a few weeks.\nIf anyone is interested in BETA testing demo versions of the game over the coming weeks, please reply here and let me know.\nThankyou",

That is all im going to say on that.\n\nROOMS + OBJECTS\nThere are going to be loads of rooms and locations absed in several different cities and countries throughout the world. Each room will have at least several objects, even if it is something pointless like the walls or the floor, the objects will be there. This will help the player visualise the room they are in. There are likely to be thousands of objects and overr a hjundred rooms.\n\nPLAY-TIME\nI hope to create a game that will have about five hours play-time. Which means it will take the ordinary gamer about five hours to complete.\n\nOTHERS\nAll of the characters in the game will be fully interactice (including the NPCs) and you will be able to have full menu-driven conversations with almost everyone in the game.\n\nI hope this has got some of you interested, if you would like to know more about certain aspects of the game, jus treply with oyur questions.",
