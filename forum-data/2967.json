      "EditableText": "I'm trying to create a string that will change dialogue depending on the character I'm addressing. For example: Say I have two characters in a room and I want to say &quot;Hello&quot; to each of them by typing something like &quot;Say hello to _whateverthecharacter'snameis_&quot; and have each character respond in a different way. Like this:\n\n&gt;say hello to mike\nMike says &quot;Hi there.&quot;\n\nand alternatively\n\n&gt;say hello to james\nJames says &quot;Good morning.&quot;\n\n\nSimple example, but I'm trying to achieve something like that. I've been able to change dialogue depending on which character is in the room by using the 'if' string, but when two characters are in a room at the same time it can't seem to distinguish which one I'm talking to no matter what I try. Is there a way to address characters individually that I'm just not seeing?\n\nAt present I have it set up as:\nsay #text# to #text_object# in the command pattern menu and am using a switch to denote the 'ifs&quot; as in 'if a character is present in the room&quot; but with more than one character present it just seems to get confused. Any help would be much appreciated.",
