It's first review is 3 stars.\nThat's our first game so don't think its bad. The 2 Developers are Joe Dell and I. We worked on it in 3 days and worked on it 15-20 minutes per day. We couldn't think of a story idea. We're probably going to make a sequel when this game is fully developed.\nIf you think our game is bad remember it's our first.",
