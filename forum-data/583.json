If you have an object called \"big fat dirty towel\", allow the user to refer to it as several shorter names such as \"big towel, fat towel, dirty towel\" OR at the very least just 'towel'.\n\nThere are too many games where I have to type \"use the four foot long double barrelled shotgun on the mad man with worn jeans and runs with a slight limp\" when all I had to type was \"use gun on man\" or \"shoot man\"\n\nTake advantage of these little options and you can make not only a good-looking game, but also an easy-to-play game.\n\nI've said my peace...now go make some games!",
