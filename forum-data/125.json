The story is set in Medieval times (obviously), and you have your basic swords and armour which you collect throughout the world.  The world is based on Severance: Blade of Darkness, as are the items.  most systems are set using string variables, as i havent used Quest properly for quite a while.  (havent used it properly since i first made Ebersmile, which you will probably all remember), but with help i can probably get things done quicker.  The gameplay and style is based on Diablo, as you will go through the world solving puzzles, and completing quests given by the NPC's.  I dont think there will be much combat involved as its not really a hack and slash game.  Any help would be much appriciated during the development of the game  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
