I plan on releasing an updated version in the future with one or two extra games in there, like maybe craps, and such.\n\nWhat RPS does:\nKeeps track of the player choices, and wins and losses.\nIf the player favors a specific choice, the computer will begin to notice this and choose more often the choice that will win over it.\n\nWhat I would like is for you all to look over it and help me learn ways to shorten the code / make it better.\nThe biggest roadblock I had to overcome was the &quot;divide by 0&quot; error. I wanted to create a rate where the probability the opponent would choose something would increase, but since everything starts off at 0, the game wouldn't let me. I didn't feel like writing a bunch of &quot;IF&quot; statements to get around this pitfall.\nI also wondered if there was a way to create a visible command. It would be similar to a Verb, but would be visible at all times as an option you could click and it would just execute the command without having to type it in.\n\nThanks guys,\nKitsune",

If you just want a link in the display area, you could have a turn script that throws up some hyperlinked text. And that text could execute whatever you want.
