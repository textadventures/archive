Here are my thoughts/comments as I was playing:\n\nI noticed that some of the room prefixes are a bit off, e.g. the first room starts with 'You are in a Welcome', and another with 'You are in an One Below'. You can change this by disabling 'use default prefix and suffix' in the 'setup' tab of each room, if you like.\n\nWhen I went into the Store Room, it made me laugh a bit when standing on a nail removed 99% of my health - I'm not sure if that was intentional, but if so, it was a humorous addition. If health gains/losses are going to be a main feature of the game, though, it might be nice / less frustrating to have some sort of warning beforehand (a description in the main Welcome area mentioning that the Store Room is dark for example).\n\nIn the canteen, I found that I couldn't take, use, eat or look at the banana (I picked up the other items). I also found that when I went into the Air Lock, I couldn't go back the way I came - going south resulted in the message 'You are in an End Game'. I assume this area is unfinished, though, so that's fine.\n\nIn general, it'd be nice to see more descriptions of what the rooms/objects look like, as at the moment, I don't have much sense of 'place' whilst playing. I liked the details you included about the key in the office being rusty, though, as well as the message about feeling warmer when picking up the coat. More of these sorts of details would be a good thing. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> It seems like you're off to a good start, so it'd be nice to hear how things progress.
