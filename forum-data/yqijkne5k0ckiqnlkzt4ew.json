Mat of System Masters here, author of The Shack and the upcoming The Foundation, it's direct sequel.\r\n\r\nI'm currently creating (whilst finishing up The Foundation) a fully fledged RPG, and I'm launching a Kickstarter for it on the 1st of July. It will run for exactly 30 days!\r\n\r\nI really need all the help I can get to get it off the ground, so please, visit the site where you can follow the dev diaries:\r\n\r\nwww.systemmasters.games\r\n\r\nAnd bookmark the Kickstarter page. You can preview it right now, but there'll be more added before it goes live! The link will continue to work once the project does go live:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mataeus/the-brothers?ref=7c8bjw&token=be285259\r\n\r\nIf you've never used Kickstarter before, a bit of useful info:\r\n\r\nAny pledge you make won't be taken out of your account until the campaign finishes. You can alter or remove your pledge until then.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't meet it's modest goal, NOTHING will be taken from ANYONE and the campaign will fail. It's all or nothing.\r\n\r\nSo, take a look at the game, see what you think and support this struggling one man dev team trying to make great games!\r\n\r\nThank you!",
