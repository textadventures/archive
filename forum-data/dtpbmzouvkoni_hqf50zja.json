One issue with your code is that you have all of the options inside the \"boots not reachable\" condition. So in order to reach the bank, they need \"boots in inventory *and* boots not available\".\r\n\r\nAm I correct in understanding that if the player is in Room 56, they can climb whether they have the boots or not? And that they can climb the bank as long as the boots are reachable (so either in the inventory, or in the same room)?\r\n\r\nIn that case, your code would look something like:\r\n```\r\nif (game.pov.parent = Stream) {\r\n  if (ListContains (ScopeReachable(), some Rubber Boots)) {\r\n    MoveObject (player, High Bank)\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"I try to climb it...and slip back down\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (game.pov.parent = Room 56) {\r\n  MoveObject (player, High Bank)\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"I can't climb at the moment\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to require the boots to be in the inventory, you'd change `ListContains (ScopeReachable(), some Rubber Boots)` to `Got (some Rubber Boots)`\r\n\r\nIf you want to require the boots to get to the High Bank from either room, it would be:\r\n```\r\nif (game.pov.parent = Stream or game.pov.parent = Room 56) {\r\n  if (ListContains (ScopeReachable(), some Rubber Boots)) {\r\n    MoveObject (player, High Bank)\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"I try to climb it...and slip back down\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"I can't climb at the moment\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne thing that seems a little awkward to me is that the player can climb a bank using boots that are reachable but not in the inventory. Some games do that, they assume the player character is smart enough to put the boots on if necessary. Which would look something like:\r\n```\r\nif (game.pov.parent = Stream or game.pov.parent = Room 56) {\r\n  if (ListContains (ScopeReachable(), some Rubber Boots)) {\r\n    WearGarment (some Rubber Bots)\r\n  }\r\n  if (GetBooplean (some Rubber Boots, \"worn\")) {\r\n    MoveObject (player, High Bank)\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"I try to climb it...and slip back down\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"I can't climb at the moment\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo me that feels more natural - in an area where the boots are needed, the character automatically puts them on before climbing.",
