      "EditableText": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm using the Custom Status Pane in my game to show off current buffs and (eventually debuffs), that tick down by 1 each round. I've fiddled around with it a bit, to ensure that it posts the information I want, but I don't want a bright orange color for the text, as it clashes with everything else textual in the game. \r\n\r\nProblem is, is that the custom status initialization script only accepts a single variable, a string, to display information in the Custom Status Pane. So, how would I get it to change the color of the text. I have found that text processor commands with the {} are ignored (thus {colour:grey:TEXT} doesn't work), but have found that bold, italic, and underline or linebreak using the <b></b> do work. \r\n\r\nAnyone know how to do it to make the custom Status Pane text be a different color?",
