      "EditableText": "Is the box \"Also create exit in the other direction\" ticked or not? If it's ticked, it should work in a spiral fine.\r\nIn fact, I don't know for certain what boardless means, but if you create exits along the bottom rooms to the south specified to the rooms at the top, they will enter from the north into the northern rooms, and if you have the box ticked for creating both exits, then leaving the northern rooms toward the north, you will enter the southern rooms from the south.\r\nIs that what you are trying to do?\r\nOr are you just trying to make them have no outline on the map?\r\nTo do that, you can just, in the map tab for each room, choose fill colour the same colour as the border colour and vice versa, so white room and white border. If you have other rooms not borderless, make the borders black, or choose another colour and make the rooms and borders the same again.\r\nIf you want a border around the nine rooms, you can create a bigger parent room. Its size in the map tab needs to be as big as the nine rooms together so add the widths 3x width of one, do the same with length, start in the centre room or specify where each box is on the map, which is what you would have to do if the outer exits return to the opposite side of the board, which I don't know that you were actually even trying to do, but earlier I had thought that.",
