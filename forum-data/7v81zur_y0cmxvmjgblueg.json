      "EditableText": "Okay, so this is gonna be super complicated but I'll explain as simply as possible. \r\n\r\nI'm basically making a game for an assessment that's due in a few weeks. I'm first year in a serious games design course so I know next to nothing about coding atm. \r\n\r\nI went through the Quest tutorial. Everything was going great, I was getting the hang of everything easily enough. But now I've run into an inventory problem that I can't work out. I've spent hours going through the forums and trying different things but I can't make it work for me, so here I am. \r\n\r\nMy character is meant to be going on a journey, in the first part she has to escape her home and she has to take some supplies with her. The catch is, there are four supplies (objects) available, and the player can only choose 2 for the character to take. They're all important. And the player's choice has consequences later on in the story. \r\n\r\n2 objects are in one room (kitchen) the player has to choose between these two. Then they go to another room (sleeping area) where the other two objects are. They have to then choose between these two. So, basically, they can only take one object from each room. \r\n\r\nHere's where I ran into trouble. The player can take the objects and they show up in the inventory, which is great. But, I want it so that if the player chooses one object in the room they can't put the other object in their inventory as well (otherwise what's the point in making the player choose if they can just put both in the inventory anyway, right?). \r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, I tried \"If ...\" statements. To keep this simple let's just stick with one room and 2 objects. I went to the inventory options of the objects in the kitchen. I went to \"Take\" and selected \"run script\" to put in the \"If ...\" statement. Which was basically  \"If you're carrying this object, you can't pick up the other blah blah blah\". I thought it would work, but when I played through to test it, I could pick up the objects but neither of them showed up in my inventory in the panel, nor were they there when I typed in the inventory command, even though it ran the \"You picked blah blah blah up\" when I took the object. I don't have either of them checked as scenery, so that's not the problem. And because they didn't show up in the inventory, I didn't get the message of \"you can't pick up this object because you have the other in your inventory\" when I tried to pick up both objects. It just let me pick them both up.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, I went back and tinkered with it. Eventually, I set the \"Take\" option as \"Default Behaviour\" and made sure the \"Object can be taken\" box was checked. THEN I went to the \"After taking the object\" section and put the \"If ...\" statements in there. So, I was hoping that it would work out like \"You've picked up this object, but oh wait, you've already picked up this other one so now you have to choose\". I played through again and it all worked just as I wanted it to. EXCEPT even though the text was telling you to choose, both items were in the inventory, so a player could just go \"I'm not gonna choose, they're both in my inventory\". \r\n\r\nI tried adding a new script in the \"Then\" statement called \"Remove object\" (or something along those lines) hoping it would just remove one of the objects from the inventory if the player picked the 2nd one up, but when I did the play through it just came up with an error.\r\n\r\nSo, now I'm stuck. How do I work this so the player can only have 1 object from each room in the inventory? Or is there a way where I can trap them so they can't progress through the game until they make a choice and drop one of the items from the inventory? \r\n\r\nI need an answer ASAP as I only have 2 weeks before the assessment it due. I'm not great at understanding complex coding so try and keep it simple, please? I'd ask my tutor but I live so far away from the university and I know she'll want me to go in so she can see it in person. I just don't have the time for that as I have other assessments for other classes too. \r\n\r\nThanks guys!",
