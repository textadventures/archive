Pardon my ignorance here...\n\nWhen I go to my walk-through in the GUI editor and click play, it zips through all my recorded commands but it does not add anything to my inventory.  The point of me making a walk-through is largely so that I do not have to restart every time I want to test the game.  X2 is a LONG game and this would be very tedious.  If I don't have the items in my inventory, I cannot test from the point at which I left off.  What am I missing?\n\nThanks in advance.",
