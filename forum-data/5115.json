So in quest, you just use the '=' for both cases of '=' and '==' coding\n\nand here's some big more examples (which unfrotunately wasted 18 hrs for you to find out, my sincere apologies!):\n\nlet me explain writing in attribute scripting... (it's a bit late, since you already wasted 18 hours figuring this out... HK feels very bad):\n\nQuest's terminolgy:\n\nVARIABLES:\n-&gt; Variables: local (only works for its own scripting block)\n-&gt; Attributes: global (can be used in any scripting block, so long as the Object, which it is attached to, exists, of course)\n-&gt; Parameters: these are just like Variables, except that they're special Variables, for being able to transfer (and also optionally rename) them among scriptings (see Functions, Commands, and etc)\n\ngeneral syntax for setting~defining and~or altering Attributes:\n\nglobal usage (Attributes): Object_name.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n~OR~\nlocal usage (Variables): variable_string_name = Value_or_Expression\nexample A (using quest's built-in variable for 'get input' and 'show menu' Functions~Scripts): result = Value\nexample B: handled = false // or true\nexample C: you_go_first = true // or false\nexample D: game_state = 0\nexample E: game_state = 1 // or 2, 3, 4, etc\nexample F: game_state = &quot;0&quot;\nexample G: game_state = &quot;1&quot; // or &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, etc\n// notice how NONE of these Variable examples are 'attached' to an Object\n\nOPERATORS:\n\nequals: =\nnot equals A: not Object_name.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n* not equals B: &lt;&gt;\n* lesser than: &lt;\n* greater than: &gt;\n** lesser than and equal to: &lt;=\n** greater than and equal to: &gt;=\n\n* if you're writing in the code directly (not via the GUI~Editor's text boxes), then you need to encase the scripting within these tags (as this tells quest engine that the encased '&lt; and &gt;' are not tags but OPERATORS):\n\n&lt;![CDATA[ scripting ]]&gt;\n\nfor example:\n\n[code:p7fkfxpk]&lt;function name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;\n  if (player&#46;strength_integer &gt;= 51) {\n    msg (&quot;strong&quot;)\n  } else if (player&#46;strength_integer = 50) {\n    msg (&quot;average&quot;)\n  } else if (player&#46;strength_integer &lt;= 49) {\n    msg (&quot;weak&quot;)\n  }\n&#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/function&gt;[/code:p7fkfxpk]\n\n** I think the equals *HAS TO BE* on the right side of the greater than or lesser than\n\nand then it (the setting~defining and~or altering of Attributes or Variables) can also being applied to 'if' scripting:\n\nif (Object_name.Attribute_name OPERATOR Value_or_Expression) { scripting } else if (Object_name.Attribute_name OPERATOR Value_or_Expression) { scripting } else { scripting }\n\nnow, here's where you wasted 18 hours, due to me not explaining this to you:\n\nAttribute Types:\n\nStrings, Objects, Integers, Doubles (Floats~Floating Points~decimal numbers), Booleans, Scripts, Lists, Dictionaries, etc\n\nFOR SCRIPTING WRITING:\n\nString Attributes:\n\nthe Value or its textual parts in an Expression, MUST be encased in quotes, as this is what tells the quest engine, the Value (or textual parts) are Strings\n\nAlso, the Value may NOT be these special strings: 'true' nor 'false', as these are set aside for Boolean Attributes' Values\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = &quot;Value&quot;\nexample: player.alias = &quot;HK&quot;\n~OR~\nexample: player.static_greeting = &quot;Hi, my name is HK.&quot;\n//outputs: Hi, my name is HK.\n~OR~\nexample: player.dynamic_greeting = &quot;Hi, my name is &quot; + player.alias + &quot;.&quot;\n//outputs (for my example of: player.alias=&quot;HK&quot;): Hi, my name is HK.\n\nLastly, do note, that numerical Values can be either a String or an Integer~Double, which is determined by whether you encase it in quotes (String) or not (Integer~Double):\n\nString Attribute: player.strength = &quot;100&quot;\nvs\nInteger Attribute: player.strength = 100\nvs\nDouble Attribute: player.strength = ?100.00? (actually, I've not worked with them, so maybe they do use quotes, or not, as I don't know, lol)\n\nString Attribute VS Object Attribute:\n\nString Attribute: player.food = &quot;apple&quot;\nvs\nObject Attribute: player.food = apple\n[code:p7fkfxpk]&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;food&quot; type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;empty&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;empty&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;take /&gt;\n  &lt;eat type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n    // I'm missing scripting needed to set the&#58; player&#46;food = apple, this is just an example anyways, so I'm too lazy to do it, lol\n    if (player&#46;food = apple) {\n      player&#46;life = player&#46;life + 50\n      msg (&quot;You eat the apple, re-gaining 50 life&#46;&quot;)\n    } else {\n      msg (&quot;You can't eat an apple that you don't have in your possession, silly&#46;&quot;) \n    }\n  &lt;/eat&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;[/code:p7fkfxpk]\n\nObject Attributes:\n\nby NOT encasing the Value in quotes, you're telling the engine that this is an ACTUAL Object (via its ID, which in quest is it's 'name' String Attribute), and NOT as merely a 'descriptive word (a String)' for its Value:\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = Value\n\nexample:\n\n[code:p7fkfxpk]&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;sword_1&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;alias&gt;katana&lt;/alias&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;function name=&quot;equip_sword_function&quot;&gt;\n  player&#46;right_hand = sword_1\n  msg (&quot;You equip the &quot; + sword_1&#46;alias + &quot; in your right hand&#46;&quot;)\n  // outputs&#58; You equip the katana in your right hand&#46;\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:p7fkfxpk]\n\nInteger Attributes:\n\nthe Value is (non-decimal) numeric, and NO quotes encasing it\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = numerical_but_non_decimal_Value\n\nDouble (Float~Floating Point~decimal numbers) Attributes:\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = ?numerical_and_decimal_Value?\n(again, I don't know if its Value does use quotes or not)\n\nBoolean Attributes:\n\nthe Value must be either 'true' or 'false, and NO quotes encasing it\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = true_or_false\n\nexample:\n\nthe orc starts alive: orc.dead = false // we'd usually actually use though the 'creation' tag for setting it's initial setting (unless you like using scripting for creating everything ~ good coders prefer doing it this way, anyways):\n\nthe '-&gt;' (arrow) on the left side is just my 'arrow' method to show the indenting needed (instead of using the code box). These 'arrows' of mine are NOT proper syntaxing, you'll have to delete them (but keep the indenting correct of course):\n\nexample:\nif (...) {\n-&gt; if (...) {\n-&gt;-&gt; if (...) {\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;blah&quot;)\n-&gt;-&gt; }\n-&gt; }\n}\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;dead&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\nthen we kill it (within a scripting): orc.dead = true\n\n[code:p7fkfxpk]// using Jay's preferred~correct~simple syntax for this example&#58;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;dead&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;function name=&quot;fight_orc_function&quot;&gt;\n  if (orc&#46;dead) {\n    msg (&quot;It is already dead, silly&#46;&quot;)\n  } else {\n    orc&#46;dead = true\n    msg (&quot;You fight and kill the orc&#46;&quot;)\n  }\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:p7fkfxpk]\n\nusing my conceptual example (though it's redundant and~or wrong at a deeper level of code understanding as Jay explains, but it does still works as a functional syntax in quest, if by chance you prefer doing it this longer typed way):\n\n[code:p7fkfxpk]&lt;function name=&quot;fight_orc_function&quot;&gt;\n  if (orc&#46;dead = true) {\n    msg (&quot;It is already dead, silly&#46;&quot;)\n  } else if (orc&#46;dead = false) {\n    orc&#46;dead = true\n    msg (&quot;You fight and kill the orc&#46;&quot;)\n  }\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:p7fkfxpk]\n\nanyways... that's it for now... hope this helps!

These 'arrows' of mine are NOT proper syntaxing, you'll have to delete them (but keep the indenting correct of course):<br/><br/>example:<br/>if (...) {<br/>-&gt; if (...) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; if (...) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;blah&quot;)<br/>-&gt;-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; }<br/>}<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;dead&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>then we kill it (within a scripting): orc.dead = true<br/><br/><pre><code>// using Jay's preferred~correct~simple syntax for this example&#58;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;attr name=&quot;dead&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;function name=&quot;fight_orc_function&quot;&gt;<br/>  if (orc&#46;dead) {<br/>    msg (&quot;It is already dead, silly&#46;&quot;)<br/>  } else {<br/>    orc&#46;dead = true<br/>    msg (&quot;You fight and kill the orc&#46;&quot;)<br/>  }<br/>&lt;/function&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>using my conceptual example (though it's redundant and~or wrong at a deeper level of code understanding as Jay explains, but it does still works as a functional syntax in quest, if by chance you prefer doing it this longer typed way):<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;function name=&quot;fight_orc_function&quot;&gt;<br/>  if (orc&#46;dead = true) {<br/>    msg (&quot;It is already dead, silly&#46;&quot;)<br/>  } else if (orc&#46;dead = false) {<br/>    orc&#46;dead = true<br/>    msg (&quot;You fight and kill the orc&#46;&quot;)<br/>  }<br/>&lt;/function&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>anyways... that's it for now... hope this helps! (well, it's a bit too late, but it might save you another 18 hours, lol)<br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>someone converted 'King's Quest V' (I think it's V~5 anyways) over to quest, so if interested, you can hopefully find it, download it, and play it, hehe.

      "EditableText": "some coding errors prevent the initiation of your game from even loading~starting up, and some coding errors just pop up during game play. Don't worry if your game won't even load up (it's not ruined!), as all you got to do is to open your game file via a text software~program (notepad, wordpad, notepad++, text editor ~ apple computer, or etc), and then fix (trouble shoot) the code errors... we can help with that too, especially the good coders here, whereas I only sometimes can do so (it's harder for me to look through someone elses code and spot the errors with it, than it is for the good coders here to do so, hehe).\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nmy use of these *general* VARIABLE syntax structures, is just MY method of depiction of its general structure (sorry for its confusion!):\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n~OR~\nvariable_string_name = Value_or_Expression\n(but 'variable_string_name' isn't going to be discussed, as it is simplier, no attachment ~ which is for global usage, as this is just local usage)\n\nyou replace my 'Object_name' with the Object's NAME, for example 'player' or 'game' or 'whatever' Object (which also has the Attribute you want to use: aka Object+Attribute must be correctly together, for it to exist and thus be used by you, lol):\n\nplayer.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n~OR~\ngame.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n~OR~\norc_1.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n~OR~\netc etc etc\n\nyou also do the same for my 'Attribute_name', replacing it with the Attribute's NAME, for example 'Flying_turns_left', 'strength', 'dead', right_hand', etc:\n\nplayer.Flying_turns_left = Value_or_Expression\n~OR~\ngame.event_flag_integer = Value_or_Expression\n~OR~\norc_1.dead_boolean = Value_or_Expression\n~OR~\ntable_1.material_type_string = Value_or_Expression\netc etc etc\n\nlastly, you either give it a Value or an Expression of whatever it is that you want to do with it obviously, for some examples:\n\nplayer.Flying_turns_left = 5\n~OR~\ngame.event_flag_integer = 99\n~OR~\norc_1.dead_boolean = false\n~OR~\ntable_1.material_type_string = &quot;oak wood&quot;\n~OR~\nHK.physical_damage_integer = HK.claymore_sword.physical_damage_integer + HK.claymore_sword.physical_damage_integer * HK.strength_integer / 100 - orc.full_plate_armor.resistance_integer - orc.full_plate_armor.resistance_integer * orc.endurance / 100\n~OR~\netc etc etc\n\nthe scripting's attachments (Object_name.Attribute_name) corresponds to the 'containment: parent-child' heirarchy (the indenting~nesting level), for example of this scripting:\n\nHK.physical_damage_integer = HK.claymore_sword.physical_damage_integer + HK.claymore_sword.physical_damage_integer * HK.strength_integer / 100 - orc.full_plate_armor.resistance_integer - orc.full_plate_armor.resistance_integer * orc.endurance / 100\n\ncorresponds to this:\n\n(or, add~create these Attributes to their Objects, as seen below, via through the GUI~Editor's: Object -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add)\n\n[code:rymy760t]&lt;object name=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;dead_boolean&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;endurance_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;25&lt;/attr&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;attack&quot; type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n    HK&#46;physical_damage_integer = HK&#46;claymore_sword&#46;physical_damage_integer + HK&#46;claymore_sword&#46;physical_damage_integer * HK&#46;strength_integer / 100 - orc&#46;full_plate_armor&#46;resistance_integer - orc&#46;full_plate_armor&#46;resistance_integer * orc&#46;endurance / 100\n  &lt;object name=&quot;full_plate_armor&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;attr name=&quot;resistance_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;40&lt;/attr&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;strength_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/atrr&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;claymore_sword&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;attr name=&quot;physical_damage_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;50&lt;/attr&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;[/code:rymy760t]\n\n-----------------\n\nthis might be an issue with quest trying to handle spaces, as when it parses a code line, it has to (tries to) figure out: 'okay is this a NAME String Attribute, a Command's PATTERN, a Function~Expression, and etc'... So, it's better to not use spaces if possible, to avoid any possible issues with them vs it being a separate issue causing the problem. Quest can handle spaces pretty well (Alex has done a good jo with the underlying engine), probably better than most other engines, but there are quite a bit of space issues that still pop up here that people post help on trying to troubleshoot (beware copy and pasting in accidentally copying too far, having some unwanted spaces being copied either at the beginning or end of the code line you're trying to copy, lol).\n\nSpaces okay as (in the) Values for String Attributes, but for the actual 'NAMES' of Attributes, Objects, Elements, and etc... you shouldn't use spaces.\n\n------\n\nin an MS-DOS-like language (not sure about the common languages as I've not learned them yet), you can 'save' a Variable, via pseudo (I'm still trying to learn it):\n\nVariable ==&gt; Name\n%Variable% ==&gt; Value\n!Variable! ==&gt; ?Altered Secondary Value?\n\nwith quest, it uses Objects to 'save' Attributes (so long as the Object exists ~ remains existing, of course):\n\nScripting's Initial Setting, Re-setting, and~or Altering~Changing of Attributes:\n\n(as you took 18 hrs to find out, the syntax of the Value is what determines the Attribute Type, and~or you use a conversion Function: ToInt, ToString, or ToDouble, on your Value to get it to being the right Attribute Type)\n\nexamples:\nplayer.strength_integer = 100\nplayer.strength_integer = player.strength_integer + 50\nplayer.strength_integer = player.endurance_integer + player.agility_integer\nplayer.strength_integer = 25\n\n(such as after casting a healing spell or using a healing item)\nif (player.current_life_integer &gt; player.maximum_life_integer) {\n-&gt; player.current_life_integer = player.maximum_life_integer\n}\nmsg (&quot;Life: &quot; + player.current_life_integer + &quot;/&quot; + player.maximum_life_integer)\n// example output: Life: 999/999\n\nmsg (&quot;What is your age?&quot;)\nget input {\n-&gt; // quest engine automatically sets a String Variable: result = &quot;your_typed_in_input&quot;\n-&gt; // thus we need to convert it from a String to an Integer:\n-&gt; player.age_integer = ToInt (result)\n}\n\nGUI~Editor's initial setting of Attributes ONLY:\n\n'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (see below)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: strength_integer\nAttribute Type: int (integer)\nAttribute Value = 10\n\nhow the initial setting looks as the coding tag:\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;strength_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\nsee how the 'player' Player Object holds~contains the 'strength_integer' Integer Attribute ???\n\nin scripting it is syntaxed as the dot~period 'attachment', of this:\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name:\nplayer.strength_integer\nexample usage:\nmsg (player.strength)\n// ouputs: 10\n\nand then (depends on the scripting you're doing, such as the above, or here, such as initial setting, re-setting, or altering~changing the Attribute and its Value) Value too:\n\nplayer.strength_integer = 10\nbut, say, now I want it to be:\nplayer.strength_integer = 30\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nso... for your GUI PIC example...\n\nin the box:\n\nAttribute: &quot;Flying turns left&quot;\n\nyou got some issues... due to me confusing you... it takes awhile to learn this stuff, and I didn't do a good job of explaining it enough.\n\nthis is the Attribute's 'name' (ID) String Attribute, so NO quotes encasing it. (The quotes are for encasing the Attribute's Value, HOWEVER via using the GUI~Editor's text boxes, you do NOT need to even put quotes encasing the Value, as the GUI~Editor does this underneath~unseen for you. ONLY when you're writing~typing in the coding yourself, aka NOT using the GUI~Editor's text boxes, do you need to put in the correct syntaxing punctuation, like encasing quotes on a String Attribute's Values.

So, it's better to not use spaces if possible, to avoid any possible issues with them vs it being a separate issue causing the problem. Quest can handle spaces pretty well (Alex has done a good jo with the underlying engine), probably better than most other engines, but there are quite a bit of space issues that still pop up here that people post help on trying to troubleshoot (beware copy and pasting in accidentally copying too far, having some unwanted spaces being copied either at the beginning or end of the code line you're trying to copy, lol).<br/><br/>Spaces okay as (in the) Values for String Attributes, but for the actual 'NAMES' of Attributes, Objects, Elements, and etc... you shouldn't use spaces.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>in an MS-DOS-like language (not sure about the common languages as I've not learned them yet), you can 'save' a Variable, via pseudo (I'm still trying to learn it):<br/><br/>Variable ==&gt; Name<br/>%Variable% ==&gt; Value<br/>!Variable! ==&gt; ?Altered Secondary Value?<br/><br/>with quest, it uses Objects to 'save' Attributes (so long as the Object exists ~ remains existing, of course):<br/><br/>Scripting's Initial Setting, Re-setting, and~or Altering~Changing of Attributes:<br/><br/>(as you took 18 hrs to find out, the syntax of the Value is what determines the Attribute Type, and~or you use a conversion Function: ToInt, ToString, or ToDouble, on your Value to get it to being the right Attribute Type)<br/><br/>examples:<br/>player.strength_integer = 100<br/>player.strength_integer = player.strength_integer + 50<br/>player.strength_integer = player.endurance_integer + player.agility_integer<br/>player.strength_integer = 25<br/><br/>(such as after casting a healing spell or using a healing item)<br/>if (player.current_life_integer &gt; player.maximum_life_integer) {<br/>-&gt; player.current_life_integer = player.maximum_life_integer<br/>}<br/>msg (&quot;Life: &quot; + player.current_life_integer + &quot;/&quot; + player.maximum_life_integer)<br/>// example output: Life: 999/999<br/><br/>msg (&quot;What is your age?&quot;)<br/>get input {<br/>-&gt; // quest engine automatically sets a String Variable: result = &quot;your_typed_in_input&quot;<br/>-&gt; // thus we need to convert it from a String to an Integer:<br/>-&gt; player.age_integer = ToInt (result)<br/>}<br/><br/>GUI~Editor's initial setting of Attributes ONLY:<br/><br/>'player' Player Object -&gt; Attributes Tab -&gt; Attributes -&gt; Add -&gt; (see below)<br/><br/>(Object Name: player)<br/>Attribute Name: strength_integer<br/>Attribute Type: int (integer)<br/>Attribute Value = 10<br/><br/>how the initial setting looks as the coding tag:<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>-&gt; &lt;attr name=&quot;strength_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>see how the 'player' Player Object holds~contains the 'strength_integer' Integer Attribute ???<br/><br/>in scripting it is syntaxed as the dot~period 'attachment', of this:<br/><br/>Object_name.Attribute_name:<br/>player.strength_integer<br/>example usage:<br/>msg (player.strength)<br/>// ouputs: 10<br/><br/>and then (depends on the scripting you're doing, such as the above, or here, such as initial setting, re-setting, or altering~changing the Attribute and its Value) Value too:<br/><br/>player.strength_integer = 10<br/>but, say, now I want it to be:<br/>player.strength_integer = 30<br/><br/>------------------------------------------<br/><br/>so... for your GUI PIC example...<br/><br/>in the box:<br/><br/>Attribute: &quot;Flying turns left&quot;<br/><br/>you got some issues... due to me confusing you... it takes awhile to learn this stuff, and I didn't do a good job of explaining it enough.<br/><br/>this is the Attribute's 'name' (ID) String Attribute, so NO quotes encasing it.

I added in a check for you... test it... you may be getting a qwasi-double message, if you already got it set up to message something in your own code, due to me putting in a message as well, when your flying turns run out.\n\n------\n\nlastly (a minor fix), in your:\n\n&lt;game name=&quot;Eanatas&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/game&gt;\n\nyou had a space in front of it:\n\n&lt;game name=&quot;(space)Eanatas&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/game&gt;\n\nwhich I edited out.\n\nthis (an unnoticed accidental space) was actually the cause of someone else's error that I was trying to help troubleshoot... somehow Pixie spotted it... amazing!\n\n----\n\nalso... you may be having a conflict since both your Game's name and your Player Object's name is 'Eanatas', you may need to change one of them...",

I added in a check for you... test it... you may be getting a qwasi-double message, if you already got it set up to message something in your own code, due to me putting in a message as well, when your flying turns run out.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>lastly (a minor fix), in your:<br/><br/>&lt;game name=&quot;Eanatas&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/game&gt;<br/><br/>you had a space in front of it:<br/><br/>&lt;game name=&quot;(space)Eanatas&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/game&gt;<br/><br/>which I edited out.<br/><br/>this (an unnoticed accidental space) was actually the cause of someone else's error that I was trying to help troubleshoot... somehow Pixie spotted it... amazing!<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>also... you may be having a conflict since both your Game's name and your Player Object's name is 'Eanatas', you may need to change one of them...<div><a href=\"/attachment/1194\">Eanatas edited.aslx</a></div>",
