      "EditableText": "New to Quest and have been playing around with the tutorial and stuff. But how do i update room descriptions to call the status of whether an object like blinds and/or a door has been opened? The blinds are just flavour and it would be nice to say if they are letting light in or not (i have them set as a open/close container) and the door is acting as a closed container since you don't really need to go into that room but it does contain an item (which i've got that part down).\r\n\r\nCan the scripts for the blinds/door print it's status back to the parent? Or would i just add a script to the room description that would be looking  to the door/blind status?\r\n\r\nProgramming is not my forte, hence using Quest which does help simplify things. :)\r\n\r\nThanks!",
