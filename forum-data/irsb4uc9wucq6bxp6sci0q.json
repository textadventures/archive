      "EditableText": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI'm using Quest to create a random generate with the split () function, like so: \r\n\r\n```\r\ngame.race_list_1 = split (\"Human;Elf;High Elf;Moon Elf;Dark Elf;Gnome;Dwarf;Halfling;Orc;Troll;Ogre;Molt;Fairy;Fetchling;Satyr;Ancient;Avari;AI;Merperson;Patagi;Titan;Dionae;\")\r\n\r\nrace_selection = StringListItem (game.race_list_1, GetRandomInt (0, ListCount (game.race_list_1) - 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese two lines effectively create the string list for me with split, and the race_selection line picks from that list created in the previous line and assigns it to that variable. Simple enough, but since I'm a beginner at coding and I nicked this code from one of the other posts on the forum, I can't for the life of me figure out why it's returning a blank result as it it's just another entry in the list when I actually generate it. This goes for every single list created by this means, often making a result like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe woman before you is a . She has nil skin. This is an error. Her face is exotic, with protruding This is an error. eyes, a hawk nose, and lips.\r\n\r\nShe is motivated by prestige. Her favorite sin is Lust. Her personality type is the Commander.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt outputs readable errors because I allowed the else on the skin_color, eye_shape, and the hair message, but that's the gist of it. Can anyone help?",
