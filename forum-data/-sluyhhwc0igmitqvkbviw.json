So I'm sorry if I missed the obvious solution.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to stack two background images atop each other within the body of the CSS. Then, I apply a background blend mode. (background-blend-mode: lighten;    for example)\r\n\r\nI can do all of this within the CSS of a webpage. But I can't wrap my head around the strange format Quest nests the Javascript/CSS in messages. In CSS, it would look something like...\r\n\r\nbackground-image: url(quest://local/forest.png),url(quest://local/fog.png)\r\nbackground-blend-mode: lighten;\r\n\r\nBut I just can't figure out how to properly set it when I have to format it the Quest way... like so:\r\n\r\nJS.eval(\"$('body').css({backgroundImage: 'url(\\\\'\"+ GetFileURL(\"forest.png\") +\"\\\\')'});\")\r\nJS.eval (\"$('body').css({backgroundRepeat: 'repeat-y', backgroundAttachment: 'fixed', backgroundSize: '100%'});\")\r\n\r\nHow can I append the \"fog.png\" so that it will be paired with \"forest.png\"?
