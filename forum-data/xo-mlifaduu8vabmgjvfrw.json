      "EditableText": "OK, I'm working on a game now (shock!) because my attention was bouncing around too much just doing libraries and stuff.\r\n\r\nSo, the player is trapped in a haunted preschool/daycare. The evil spirit controlling the place wants kids to look after, so it uses magic to make you into a child again.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a standard RPG-ish battle system, with a somewhat non-standard levelling. The monsters here are childish nightmares; and by beating them you can grow up again. Your level is your age; you can raise it by claiming XP. But unlike most RPGs, levelling up increases some stats but weakens others, so some monsters are easier to face at a lower level.\r\n\r\nAnd the question: Can anyone suggest some rooms (or even puzzles) that might require you to be a certain age? I'm thinking that there should be some areas of the school that can only be accessed above or below certain ages (harder areas you have to level up to reach; or areas you can't go back to once you've grown up too much).\r\n\r\nI've got a few puzzle elements based on the ageing mechanic; such as a string function that randomly jumbles letters, making any printed text you come across harder to read the younger you are. This will make the \"sticky note with the password on\" puzzle a bit harder. And stairs that are too big for you to climb, so you have to be a certain level to leave the basement. But I'm thinking that the (non-crazy) ghost staff might also remove you from certain areas if you're too old or too young. What places should be restricted to certain ages?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions welcome :D",

There would be some pretty tight spaces there. So if you find monsters there you're at a penalty for each level over a certain point, and if you're too old you just can't fit through the door.\r\n\r\nOne thing I was thinking about was non-evil ghosts. Maybe some other kids just running through the same little stories again and again; and adults who work there acting like nothing is out of the ordinary. They're just like memories of the people who used to run this place, repeating old routines. So if you do something they don't know how to deal with they kind of disintegrate. Their kindness is keeping the big crazy ghost suppressed; so killing a friendly ghost is super easy, but makes the game harder. (You get an XP penalty, and all the monsters get tougher).\r\n\r\nWhat I'm really stuck on is what age restrictions might be placed on different locations by the friendly ghosts.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that \"level\" will go up to 255 (though \"normal\" play is unlikely to require going beyond 100), and roughly correspond to an age in months. You could start anywhere in the range 20-80, depending on your character creation choices. If your age drops too low, then you can't even crawl, so your only choice is to wait for wandering monsters to come to you and hope you can level up again before you get beaten too badly.\r\n\r\n(I've also decided that character creation will be a bit odd. You can choose any number of character classes; which includes jobs, genders, races, and agegroups. While picking them, you might get some indication on screen of whether you're playing the game in 'easy' or 'hard' mode, depending if you pick particularly effective combinations)\r\nAnd after all the time I've put into a partially-complete character creation library… I'm not using it. You start in a \"dream room\" with all the classes scattered around you as objects. You have to pick at least one gender and one other before you can use the command \"wake up\", and then all the ones you're carrying have their stats multiplied onto yours.",
