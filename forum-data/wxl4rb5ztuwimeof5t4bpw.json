Congratulations!\r\n\r\nIf you're worried about the legal significance, I'm of course no lawyer, but I think you're being asked for something called \"performance rights\". That's totally a thing, and Nintendo for instance has been known to crack down on such uses, including Let's Play videos of their games. But unless the streamer will be making $$$ and not paying you a cent, it means very little. So relax and watch the show, whenever it happens.",
