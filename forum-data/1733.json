I decided to erase the verb, so I clicked on the verb heading in the right-hand column (the tab heading) to list verbs and remove option.  But in the right-hand column, underneath the heading Verb was listed all of the Rooms... Rooms under the Verb heading?  Huh?  So I clicked here and there and whereever to try and smack the Editor into sensibleness.  The Editor gave up after about 5 or 6 different tries, clicking here and there and whereever, and finally listed the verb under the Verb heading.  (This needs to be corrected.).\r\n\r\nAlso, I've experienced seeing a verb listed in the left hand tree column, but in the right column, there's no verb listed.",
