You'd need Android Studio as well, though, but I have made 2 Inform games into apps that way.  It's a little stressful the first go-round, but it's smooth-sailing after that.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe Phonegap method is supposedly easy as well, but, alas... my phone is my WiFi hotspot, so the hosting thing doesn't work on my setup.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAnyway, I'm no help.  \r\n\r\nGood luck!",
