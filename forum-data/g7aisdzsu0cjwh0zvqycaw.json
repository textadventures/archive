But I also want to drop all weapons in my inventory.\r\n\r\nCan some kind soul please tell me how to drop all items with a certain attribute from a player's inventory? Thank you so much. \r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n'If object in inventory has attribute x then drop object.'\r\n\r\nExample where your character may disarm, but only under duress.

It doesn't have to be an attribute. Any flag or other way of signifying the type of item would work.",
