Since it doesn't appear to be an object in the game, or have a parent, how can I use functions like ScopeInventory () or foreach ()?\r\n\r\nSay I want to use the second pane as an equipment panel, and I want each object contained to have a weight, and that the weight of all objects should be tallied together to check against the player's equip load. How could I go about doing this?",
