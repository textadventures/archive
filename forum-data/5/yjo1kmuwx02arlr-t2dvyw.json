Sorry I'm being such a pest! I hate that I feel like I'm asking step-by-step hints on this one, but you certainly have made a complicated puzzle. Please see obscured question below: \r\n\r\n<font color=white> OK. So I am in the tapestry room. I have managed to open the wardrobe, and now I am facing a hole. I presume it is a similar hole to that of the one in the main room, which I have never been able to examine due to being quite short. I have never seen a man do anything with a fireplace, which I noted other people mentioned prior to getting into the tapestry room itself, so I am afraid I've missed something else. I do have all of the stones, and initially thought maybe they fit into the knobs of the cross pommee hole somehow, but they're all notably squared, where the cross knobs are round. I try to manipulate the candlestick, which I suspect is part of the solution, but as of yet it does not move when I attempt to move/push/pull/lift it. So that's where I'm at right now. </font> \r\nThanks. :)",
