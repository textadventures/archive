I learned something without the need to read through some 50 page long scientific paper :D\r\n\r\nSecond half of the game gets bit tedious as it is all just talking during meetings. I would sprinkle some \"action\" to it by maybe having player doing some research, or collecting samples themselves. It would give another insight into the topic, and helps break the monotony. \r\n\r\nFor example examining samples for contamination to discard them (would affect how the research goes in the long run), collecting samples themselves (how far do you stick the spatula into the volunteer's mouth? Could be some funny outcome there :P) or just adding something in between. \r\n\r\nThere are some jumps like \"4 months later\" or \"1 year later\". Plenty of time to add some stuff there... for instance some crisis or government pulling the funds and player needs to defend the funding, or diffusing situation with some protestors protesting in front of the institute... you get the jist :)\r\n\r\nOther than that, a game well done and thank you for making me aware of this biobank business!",
