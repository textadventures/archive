Anyone know why that is, or how it can be fixed?\n\n Thanks,\nSlackers Inc.\n\n**Edit**\n So now it no longer says 'server not found' and I can log in, but when I click 'submit a game' and click upload, nothing seems to happen. It's like it doesn't like my game or something.\n\n**Edit**\n It took a few modifications to the game, but I finally got it uploaded. Hope you guys enjoy playing it!\nURL: [url:2h07w8sb]http&#58;//textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk//review&#46;php?game=336[/url:2h07w8sb]",
