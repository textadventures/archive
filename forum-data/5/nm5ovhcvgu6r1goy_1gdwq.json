I'm here to announce my project that I been working on.\r\nThe name of project is ***The Street***, the game is based on a young man who tries to save himself from \"ghetto\" because he is tired from poverty and being threatened with his life. I didn't started to write a storyline yet -but when I do, I guess it'll progressively evolve into a very epic one- but I assume that will not be much crime-driven like Grand Theft Auto, rather circulate around \"mystery\" a bit. I'm planning an advanced and interactive gameplay; you can *work, spend, buy properties, date, use objects, do sports...*\r\nCurrently the game is in version alpha 0.1.6 and has nothing much.  I might publish some early access releases there.\r\nGreetings.",
