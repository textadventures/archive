I missed IFComp this year, so it might just slip out in the cracks between comps. But regardless, I'm looking to get people's opinions and possibly address any issues before releasing it generally.\n\nIf you're interested (and contrary to what I said before, you don't have to be kind - just honest), then PM me.\n\nIt should be able to be handed out shortly. I can either hand you an unlisted online link or send you the actual .quest file if you have the desktop Quest installed.\n\nThe game itself is not big. In fact, I worry it's too short. But I can't judge anything since I'm too close. So feedback will be great.",
