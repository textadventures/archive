The warrior class is the only with RPG features (random events and stats).\r\nNow I need volunteers for beta testing.

It is amazing, but that thing still works, and most bugs are easy to fix. At least for a programmer :P\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, I'm not a native speaker. This is, after all, a way to test myself. Please be critical and point out any grammar, spelling, and even styling errors.
