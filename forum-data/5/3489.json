I love this Quest stuff!!!\n\nEdited to add:  The 'Trailer Park' is the enclosed 'world'....not sure if that was clear.\nEdited to add:  Although it would be rated &quot;Adult&quot;, the adventure doesn't use swear words, doesn't involve sex, and doesn't involve hard drugs ( a toke of marijuana would be the limit).  It should be rated 18+  ..... nothing beyond that.  It's meant to be a 'fun' adventure but not 'hard core'.",

I wouldn't have all of those room available to the player at once, I would ease them into it, if you're not planning to already.\nIt's difficult to give you guidance on that one, but I'm assuming that, just as no player would really be interested in sorting through three hundred rooms that have too much detail to appreciate, you aren't interested in making every single room in your game filled to the brim with takeable objects and unique scenery.\nSora also brought up a good point: I don't imagine that the majority of your rooms are in one straight line, but if you don't include a good method for navigation (the map feature would be very useful here) then your players are going to get lost.  A suggestion I would urge you to consider (if you can make it fit in your setting) is to make a fast-travel command.  Maybe a command that takes them to a sort of &quot;overworld map&quot; type of room with exits to important places the players might visit a lot.\n\nGood luck to your game, it sounds like it has a lot of potential!",
