My main contribution to this site has been the re-implementation of two games that were popular in the UK in the 1980s. Text adventures at that time generally didn't support interaction with items other that those that were explicitly named. Even 10 years ago, Quest 4 was distributed with nine sample games, all of this type, where the background was exactly that. We now seem to be in a position where a description of all mentioned objects is expected and the author considered 'lazy' if these descriptions are not provided. That takes quite a bit of extra effort, as I found when I added that detail to my 1980 games. Quest could help support that effort as I discussed recently in connection with Cloak of Darkness (type 'about' in: http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/cxbbr4mqakkylkr80ypjhg/cloak-of-darkness-another-version).\r\n\r\nI think there are positive aspects of the Quest site to promote.

That would mean that rejected games are much harder work for a moderator as they need to be played through to a greater extent (to see if there are any good points to mention) and a detailed explanation of rejection provided, with suitable suggestions for improvement.</p>\n<p>...and yes, I was much older than 4 in 1977!</p>\n\n",

You appear to be saying this is wrong and that annoying visitors to the site is preferential to making sure zero effort games are kept in the sandpit.\r\n\r\nLet me clarify. First, I think moderation is essential. There may be games that are completely unsuitable.  I also agree with the guidance provided by Alex on the moderation criteria (thanks for the link!):\r\n```\r\nIt's really just a matter of seeing whether any real effort at all has been put into the game.\r\n\r\nIf so, it belongs in a category - probably the same category that the author suggests, although sometimes they suggest the wrong category (for example \"Literature\" is supposed to be for works that are based on an existing book, but sometimes authors choose that category incorrectly, presumably because they think their game has words in and therefore is literature).\r\n\r\nGames belong in the Sandpit if they are:\r\n\r\n- mostly incomplete\r\n- test games\r\n- a small school project of interest only to their teacher\r\n- a small game clearly only for the author's own small circle friends\r\n- full of typos and grammatical errors\r\n- clearly the result of only a few minutes work\r\n- just generally not worthy of being on the site\r\n- etc...\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure what \"etc.\" means and so would probably be better left out! Also, I'd replace \"clearly the result of only a few minutes work\" with \"insufficient content\"...but apart from that this is promoting the minimum standard idea that I was going on about. Indeed it appears more generous. In the discussion there is the particular case of Frankenstein mentioned. I presume it is this version:\r\nhttp://play2.textadventures.co.uk/Play.aspx?id=ifsz8md0m0knnxpozpvjyw\r\n\r\nThe 'game' can be completed with three clicks and could reasonably be excluded on the basis of insufficient content but was let through.

      "EditableText": "Hey, let's play nicely! I raise issues that I think are fairly obvious, and should be looked at for the health of the site. Please don't call them 'gripes'.  :)\r\n\r\nAs the discussion has gone on, more issues have arisen. This started when a highly respected game author (his games have appeared among the editor's picks) had a competition game put in the sandpit as \"incomplete.\" That's now fixed but it raised the general possibility that other reasonable games, from less well known, and less confident authors, might be in the sandpit.

Why make a room that is truly empty? If it is there then put/hide <i>something</i> in it. It could be an item, monster, npc, or even the description of the room gives clues to what lies ahead or information needed later.\r\n\r\nI am very annoyed by <b>I can't see that</b> responses.\r\n\r\nA game  having responses, good grammar and the program working correctly is still a flop if it lacks a plot or action leading to some form of entertainment for the player. Players invest a lot of time into a game as well and the creator should give them something for their time. \r\n\r\nIf a game creator has spent a week or several months making a game they should realize that other game makers have several years in their game and have yet to publish it trying to work on the little details.\r\n\r\nI want a player to fall out of their chair at least once or twice laughing or jumping up in astonishment, yelling, \"Zork can kiss my a__!\", when they play one of my games. If they want to lick or smell an orc then have at it. If you get mad and want to throw that +7 sword into the lake, go ahead, have fun retrieving it after you cool down. \r\n\r\nI don't expect creators to go that far but dang it, put a little effort into it. Sheesh. Think about the player and what he is going through and what they may want to do to advance in the game, they don't have the answers and are looking for them.\r\n\r\nLength of game is not important to me.

If they want to lick or smell an orc then have at it. If you get mad and want to throw that +7 sword into the lake, go ahead, have fun retrieving it after you cool down.</p>\n<p>I don't expect creators to go that far but dang it, put a little effort into it.

On every IF internet forum I'd visited over the past 20 years - and there have been a lot - it's been considered the 'done thing' to implement them and the mark of a bad game when they're not implemented. I've known authors argue that it's a lot of hard work to cover everything - and it is - but then writing a good game is hard full stop and the game itself only gets worse when the author cuts corners because of one reason or another. Even here on the Quest forum, which is remarkably lenient regarding game design compared to the rest of the IF community, the majority of people seem to agree that scenery items should be covered. \r\n\r\nSo where does your opinion come? Is there some other IF community out there somewhere you're part of that doesn't cover scenery items? If you were very new to the scene and your only experience of IF was Quest games, I could kind of understand where you might have got that idea from, or if you've been sleeping since the 80's and have never played any modern IF, but neither are those are the case. So, please tell me, where does your opinion come from?",

Perhaps it could be a puzzle piece!'\r\n\r\nIt was not a puzzle piece, but there *was* a response other than \"I can't see that.\"  So, the world felt complete to me.  It was worth going east to see what other things there might be to see in that world.\r\n\r\nYou see, I imagine that many of us are wanderers at heart and are still just as curious as when we were little kids in a world which was mostly new to us.  All the things around we'd never examined closely, sometimes never even noticed.  Sometimes we want to focus on the trees while we're in the forest.  To stop and smell the air for ourselves when someone mentions the faint aroma of decaying oak leaves.  To take a good, long look at the waterfall.  (Those are all just random examples.)\r\n\r\nThe more details added to the game, the better the illusion holds up.  When playing a well-made game, it is easier to get lost in the world, still aware it's a game, but getting more into the world itself than into the mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn a good text adventure, the author creates a world filled with objects and descriptions (and sometimes NPCs) which will lead the player down the proper path.  Scenes can be planned to happen when the player performs certain actions, but lots of players just wander around aimlessly, examining and trying to take everything, until they finally decide to figure out what they're supposed to be doing and move on to the next room.  The player very rarely does what the creator would expect, because the player (unlike the author) doesn't already know what they're supposed to be doing.  Half of the fun is figuring that out by examining everything in the room, which should (technically) be everything which was mentioned in the text which printed when entering that room.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of like I'm standing beside a blind person (the player) in a park, and  I say, \"this park has billions and billions of strong, tall trees you can climb, and there is a path leading east from here.\"\r\n\r\nThe player seems interested.  \"Tell me about the trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't see that,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about the path,\" the player persists.  \"Does it seem heavily traversed?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, again, I reply, \"I can't see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, climb a tree, then,\" the player commands.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand your command,\" I say.\r\n\r\nThe player sighs, \"just quit.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\nNow, after having gone on that rant (again, for the last time, though), I will say this (again, for the last time):\r\n\r\nIn old games, any objects mentioned which were found to not exist in the world during play were immediately dismissed.  The INFOCOM instructions told us there would be things mentioned in the room descriptions which didn't actually exist in the game world.  This was simply to add to the atmosphere, and those items would in no way contribute to the story were they to actually exist in the game world.\r\n\r\nThis was acceptable (but, of course, it had to be).  We just moved on to the next thing when the game said, \"I don't understand the word 'waterfall'.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo, yeah.  I think I've tried to explain how I look at it from every possible angle.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I haven't mentioned is all the famous IF authors from the old days who still make games now.  They make sure every object mentioned in the prose exists and that every existing object has a description.  They take great pleasure in being able to add in all the silly responses for when the player interacts with insignificant things (or simply tries to do silly things).  It's those little laughs that make games truly great, in my opinion.  It also greatly increases the replay value.\r\n\r\nIt's more about what happens when you try to do something that doesn't fit the narrative than what happens when you do the right thing.  This is true in my case anyway, because I usually try to do all sorts of silly things before I land on what the author expected of me.\r\n\r\nI play a text adventure like it's a totally submergible book.  Each room is a picture painted by the author, in which I attempt to fiddle with everything in sight.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThat Ray Bradbury...  He's got me in a silly mood.\r\n\r\nNo one pay any attention to me.  I've gotten lost somewhere in the imagination.\r\n\r\n...and I am in darkness.  It is pitch black.  I can't see a thing.\r\n\r\nDid anyone else just hear that?!?\r\n\r\nUrmagosh, you guys...  There might be a grue in the other room.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna go check it out.\r\n\r\nBe right back!",

Half of the fun is figuring that out by examining everything in the room, which should (technically) be everything which was mentioned in the text which printed when entering that room.</p>\n<p>It's kind of like I'm standing beside a blind person (the player) in a park, and  I say, \"this park has billions and billions of strong, tall trees you can climb, and there is a path leading east from here.\"</p>\n<p>The player seems interested.  \"Tell me about the trees.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't see that,\" I say.</p>\n<p>\"Tell me about the path,\" the player persists.  \"Does it seem heavily traversed?\"</p>\n<p>And, again, I reply, \"I can't see that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, climb a tree, then,\" the player commands.</p>\n<p>\"I don't understand your command,\" I say.</p>\n<p>The player sighs, \"just quit.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now, after having gone on that rant (again, for the last time, though), I will say this (again, for the last time):</p>\n<p>In old games, any objects mentioned which were found to not exist in the world during play were immediately dismissed.  The INFOCOM instructions told us there would be things mentioned in the room descriptions which didn't actually exist in the game world.  This was simply to add to the atmosphere, and those items would in no way contribute to the story were they to actually exist in the game world.</p>\n<p>This was acceptable (but, of course, it had to be).  We just moved on to the next thing when the game said, \"I don't understand the word 'waterfall'.\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, yeah.  I think I've tried to explain how I look at it from every possible angle.</p>\n<p>The only thing I haven't mentioned is all the famous IF authors from the old days who still make games now.  They make sure every object mentioned in the prose exists and that every existing object has a description.  They take great pleasure in being able to add in all the silly responses for when the player interacts with insignificant things (or simply tries to do silly things).  It's those little laughs that make games truly great, in my opinion.  It also greatly increases the replay value.</p>\n<p>It's more about what happens when you try to do something that doesn't fit the narrative than what happens when you do the right thing.  This is true in my case anyway, because I usually try to do all sorts of silly things before I land on what the author expected of me.</p>\n<p>I play a text adventure like it's a totally submergible book.  Each room is a picture painted by the author, in which I attempt to fiddle with everything in sight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That Ray Bradbury...  He's got me in a silly mood.</p>\n<p>No one pay any attention to me.  I've gotten lost somewhere in the imagination.</p>\n<p>...and I am in darkness.  It is pitch black.  I can't see a thing.</p>\n<p>Did anyone else just hear that?!?</p>\n<p>Urmagosh, you guys...  There might be a grue in the other room.</p>\n<p>I'm gonna go check it out.</p>\n<p>Be right back!</p>\n\n",

      "EditableText": ">To me this has felt like a very heated thread!\r\n\r\nHas it?\r\n\r\nIt hasn't to me.  I never get heated (or even warmed).  If I am talking (or typing), I am smiling.  Perhaps my blue-collar mentality makes me seem angry in print, but everything I say (and post) is from a happy place.\r\n\r\nI promise you, guys and gals, that I will never get mad because of anything anyone says or thinks.  I may point out things I see as personal attacks, but words will never hurt me.  Personal attacks do not hurt my feelings for two reasons.  First, no one can put me under a more powerful microscope than the one I keep myself under.  I love to find my flaws.  I can either improve myself or make fun of myself, and I win either way.  Second, if someone gets personal, that usually means they know they have no valid arguments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> The 'red rag' for me has been the dismissal of authors who do not provide interaction with background objects as 'lazy'.\r\n\r\nSo you have felt provoked since the beginning of this thread (perhaps longer than that)?\r\n\r\nMan...  That makes me feel kind of sad...  I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nIs it the word \"lazy\", or just the idea that we know someone didn't put forth as much effort as they could have?  Because if it's just the word \"lazy\", I could stop using that word.  Otherwise, I can't stop noticing when authors don't put forth as much effort as they could have, especially when the majority of authors put forth maximum effort.  (I'm not trying to be unpleasant.  I just believe grading on the curve is only fair to those who put forth minimal effort (for whatever reason) when there are no overachievers.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n>Authors need to be cut some slack here and given reasonable stylistic freedom. \r\n\r\nThat's true.  It's one reason Alex created the Sandpit -- a place where non-traditional (and/or incomplete) games can still be published on this site.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> Also, some authors will not have picked up on the need to include background interaction and the depth of feeling among some reviewers and moderators on this subject, and so are in danger of having their games written off quickly if this interaction is missing. \r\n\r\nThey will learn as soon as they publish their first game.  (Just like many of us did.)\r\n\r\nIt's not like the games are deleted and the author banished.  It only took two days for this OP's game to get categorized once the OP asked why it had been classified incomplete.  The game could be played that entire time.  This site was still hosting the game.  The OP only needed to provide a link.  That's not writing a game off from my perspective.  To me, writing a game off is the IFArchive telling an author their game is not good enough to be hosted on their site at all.  This site has never done that.\r\n\r\n>This effectively elevates the importance of background interaction from \"improving a game\" to being an \"essential requirement\". \r\n\r\nIt is an expectation, and it has been for 20 years.  I mean, I see what you're saying, but...\r\n\r\n1. The site will host any game, no matter what.  Nothing is technically required except proper file formatting.\r\n\r\n2.  A text adventure living up to standard expectations is sort of essential to most players.  When a moderator sandpits something, they are trying to help the author.  Instead of putting a game on the main page for everyone to bash it, they sandpit and list a reason.  If the author objects (as in this case), the moderator(s) will look over the game again and either put it in the desired category or explain what the game lacks in greater detail.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> So, perhaps moderators on this site could agree their position and publicise it for authors? This can be at the time of submission but probably should be included in the tutorials as well.\r\n\r\nThree things:\r\n\r\n1. Each game is different, and the moderators are working off of a loose set of guidelines -- not even that, really...  It's more like instinct.  If the mod's gut tells them the game will get negative reviews due to a lack of effort (be it missing descriptions or scenery objects, or that a game is just too short or doesn't have enough choices), they will toss it into the sandpit and let the author know why they did so.\r\n\r\n2. Actual rules would be bad, I think.  They would defeat your purpose as well as mine, because we would no longer be given reasonable stylistic freedom.\r\n\r\n3. FROM THE TUTORIAL:\r\n\r\n>>The “Scenery” option means that the object won’t be displayed automatically in the room description, or the “Places and Objects” on the right of the screen.\r\n>>\r\n>>Why might we want to do this? Well, when we created our “lounge” description in the previous section, we wrote “This is quite a plain lounge with an old beige carpet and peeling wallpaper”. What if the player types “look at wallpaper”? Quest will reply “I can’t see that here”, which will be a bit strange.\r\n>>\r\n>>Although the wallpaper isn’t an important object, we should still have a response for “look at wallpaper”. If we make it a scenery object, it’s “in the background” as far as the game goes, as it won’t appear in the “Places and Objects” list, or in the list of objects in the description of the room. We won’t be cluttering things unnecessarily, but we will still be providing responses for anything the player might reasonably type in.\r\n>>\r\n>>So, create a new object called “wallpaper” and tick the Scenery box. Enter a description like “The horrible beige wallpaper hangs loosely on the walls.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n>Thank you K.V. for giving an opinion of which background items in the Sir Loin example should support interaction.\r\n\r\nYou are very welcome.  I enjoyed the bit of the game I played.\r\n\r\n---\r\n>You identified just one, the 'stalls'. For an author, however, the only practical choice is to cover all nouns in the descriptive text, so that means also including \"(royal) stable, place, castle (come-here-a-lot), shed, horses, exit, and courtyard\".\r\n\r\nThis is where I say, \"that would be overkill.  Most experienced text adventurers would not expect to be able to enter [EXAMINE (THE CURRENT ROOM)], nor would they expect to be able to examine an exit unless it was a door or a path (or something tangible).\"\r\n\r\nI think we both make valid points.\r\n\r\nIf an author doesn't know what the target audience expects from a text adventure, he or she will not know which scenery objects are expected to exist.  Creating every little thing may be time-consuming, but it could mean the difference between placing 11th and placing 1st.  \r\n\r\nThe worst thing that could happen is players overlooking details added by the author, and they would probably discover those details on future play-throughs, which would add replay value to a game.\r\n\r\nI don't believe a player has ever complained about a game being too detailed (unless someone gets frustrated with red herrings).\r\n\r\nFrom a programmer's perspective, all bases should always be covered.\r\n\r\nFrom an artist's perspective, there are no bases except the ones he or she creates (and I would think those should be covered).\r\n\r\nIn the end, I guess it boils down to trial and error.  Anyone with no (or little) experience who expects to create a work of art by following rules, guidelines, or advice will probably fail (with a few exceptions, of course).\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhat's the difference between these:\r\n\r\n>You are in a room with whatever in the background.\r\n>\r\n>You can see a ball and a bat here.\r\n>You can go north.\r\n\r\n> \\>x the whatever\r\nI can't see that.\r\n\r\n> \\>x the whatever\r\nThis game does not understand the word 'whatever' in that context.\r\n\r\n> \\>x the whatever\r\nNothing out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n> \\>x the whatever\r\nYou don't have time to go around examining whatevers all day!\r\n\r\n> \\>x the whatever\r\nIt's a very interesting looking whatever, but it doesn't look like something you'll need during this adventure.\r\n\r\nThe difference to me is that those last two are somewhat entertaining -- not just the default response.  When I read entertaining things, I am entertained.  When I read default responses, I am not entertained.  The purpose of a game is to entertain the player.  Therefore, it seems like someone creating a game would want to supply entertaining responses for any command their prose might make the player want to enter.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo, in my opinion (which is shared by many), if there are numerous objects mentioned which do not exist, that is a sign of a bad text adventure (unless it is an older game which had little space for objects and descriptions).\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't view Quest games as text adventures unless the panes and hyperlinks are disabled.  With the hyperlinks and/or panes, I view them as Quest games, which are not unlike text adventures, but not true text adventures -- more like hypertext adventures.  With the hyperlinks and/or game panes, I can see how a player could be fine with a game that does not have scenery objects, as the important objects are clearly identified.\r\n\r\nDavid W, Silver, XanMag and myself (among others here) are always talking about text adventures in general, not Quest games in particular.  Perhaps that is why we can't find common ground sometimes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n>This is largely a puzzle game with very little background description so, in general, the number of objects in each location can easily double.\r\n\r\nYes, creating an immersive world is a time-consuming process, and it is frustrating sometimes.  It makes me want to mention as few background objects as possible in my room descriptions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n>The author is also under pressure to give 'reasonable' responses to any interaction, as 'nothing out of the ordinary' and 'you can't do that' definitely look lazy!\r\n\r\nYes.  This is exactly my point.\r\n\r\nWhen an author says \"...you can see a widget...\", the default \"I can't see that\" (or any other default response when a game does not find the object mentioned in scope) is not a reasonable response to X WIDGET.  It definitely looks lazy, as if the author didn't feel the need to create what the player can supposedly see.\r\n\r\n---\r\n>The responses, however, must not be too interesting, giving the player the misleading impression that the background is part of the game...and, of course, avoiding the introduction of more nouns!\r\n\r\nAh...  Now we're getting into interesting territory.\r\n\r\nI say this is the difference between those of us with talent and those without.  XanMag and NecroDeath (just to name two) are talented.  Those dudes can come up with funny responses for anything on the spot.    I am admittedly without talent.  (I can entertain myself, but not many other people share my sense of humor.)  But I am a fluid thinker who pays great attention to detail and will spend however much time it takes to fully understand (or accomplish) something.\r\n\r\nMost good text adventures are not created by a single author.  There are also programmers, editors, testers, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do avoid the introduction of more nouns (as stated above (sorry for being repetitive)).  To me (and most players), every noun introduced is a possible clue.  Every possible clue should be examined.  That is the core of text adventuring.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> All of the action in Sir Loin takes place in and around the castle so the player could refer to it anywhere. I thought I had found a convenient shortcut by having the player carry around a 'castle' scenery object but it doesn't quite work (do you see why?).\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to find this (honestly, Pixie directed me to it and I didn't find it), but Quest has a backdrop script.\r\n\r\nFirst, turn on the advanced features for the game object (if you haven't already done so):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/49239621-ce99e100-f3c8-11e8-9bd2-38c28deaf8aa.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nThen, go the the Advanced Scripts tab, and you will see that the third field is for the Backdrop scope script:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30656341/49239672-f0936380-f3c8-11e8-898a-98f8436e47ab.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn the backdrop scope script, we can add items to a list which will be checked by Quest before each turn.

If I am talking (or typing), I am smiling.  Perhaps my blue-collar mentality makes me seem angry in print, but everything I say (and post) is from a happy place.</p>\n<p>I promise you, guys and gals, that I will never get mad because of anything anyone says or thinks.  I may point out things I see as personal attacks, but words will never hurt me.  Personal attacks do not hurt my feelings for two reasons.  First, no one can put me under a more powerful microscope than the one I keep myself under.  I love to find my flaws.  I can either improve myself or make fun of myself, and I win either way.  Second, if someone gets personal, that usually means they know they have no valid arguments.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The 'red rag' for me has been the dismissal of authors who do not provide interaction with background objects as 'lazy'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you have felt provoked since the beginning of this thread (perhaps longer than that)?</p>\n<p>Man...  That makes me feel kind of sad...  I'm sorry.</p>\n<p>Is it the word \"lazy\", or just the idea that we know someone didn't put forth as much effort as they could have?  Because if it's just the word \"lazy\", I could stop using that word.  Otherwise, I can't stop noticing when authors don't put forth as much effort as they could have, especially when the majority of authors put forth maximum effort.  (I'm not trying to be unpleasant.  I just believe grading on the curve is only fair to those who put forth minimal effort (for whatever reason) when there are no overachievers.)</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Authors need to be cut some slack here and given reasonable stylistic freedom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's true.  It's one reason Alex created the Sandpit -- a place where non-traditional (and/or incomplete) games can still be published on this site.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, some authors will not have picked up on the need to include background interaction and the depth of feeling among some reviewers and moderators on this subject, and so are in danger of having their games written off quickly if this interaction is missing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They will learn as soon as they publish their first game.  (Just like many of us did.)</p>\n<p>It's not like the games are deleted and the author banished.  It only took two days for this OP's game to get categorized once the OP asked why it had been classified incomplete.  The game could be played that entire time.  This site was still hosting the game.  The OP only needed to provide a link.  That's not writing a game off from my perspective.  To me, writing a game off is the IFArchive telling an author their game is not good enough to be hosted on their site at all.  This site has never done that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This effectively elevates the importance of background interaction from \"improving a game\" to being an \"essential requirement\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is an expectation, and it has been for 20 years.  I mean, I see what you're saying, but...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The site will host any game, no matter what.  Nothing is technically required except proper file formatting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A text adventure living up to standard expectations is sort of essential to most players.  When a moderator sandpits something, they are trying to help the author.  Instead of putting a game on the main page for everyone to bash it, they sandpit and list a reason.  If the author objects (as in this case), the moderator(s) will look over the game again and either put it in the desired category or explain what the game lacks in greater detail.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, perhaps moderators on this site could agree their position and publicise it for authors? This can be at the time of submission but probably should be included in the tutorials as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Each game is different, and the moderators are working off of a loose set of guidelines -- not even that, really...  It's more like instinct.  If the mod's gut tells them the game will get negative reviews due to a lack of effort (be it missing descriptions or scenery objects, or that a game is just too short or doesn't have enough choices), they will toss it into the sandpit and let the author know why they did so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Actual rules would be bad, I think.  They would defeat your purpose as well as mine, because we would no longer be given reasonable stylistic freedom.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FROM THE TUTORIAL:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The “Scenery” option means that the object won’t be displayed automatically in the room description, or the “Places and Objects” on the right of the screen.</p>\n<p>Why might we want to do this? Well, when we created our “lounge” description in the previous section, we wrote “This is quite a plain lounge with an old beige carpet and peeling wallpaper”. What if the player types “look at wallpaper”? Quest will reply “I can’t see that here”, which will be a bit strange.</p>\n<p>Although the wallpaper isn’t an important object, we should still have a response for “look at wallpaper”. If we make it a scenery object, it’s “in the background” as far as the game goes, as it won’t appear in the “Places and Objects” list, or in the list of objects in the description of the room. We won’t be cluttering things unnecessarily, but we will still be providing responses for anything the player might reasonably type in.</p>\n<p>So, create a new object called “wallpaper” and tick the Scenery box. Enter a description like “The horrible beige wallpaper hangs loosely on the walls.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank you K.V. for giving an opinion of which background items in the Sir Loin example should support interaction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You are very welcome.  I enjoyed the bit of the game I played.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You identified just one, the 'stalls'. For an author, however, the only practical choice is to cover all nouns in the descriptive text, so that means also including \"(royal) stable, place, castle (come-here-a-lot), shed, horses, exit, and courtyard\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is where I say, \"that would be overkill.  Most experienced text adventurers would not expect to be able to enter [EXAMINE (THE CURRENT ROOM)], nor would they expect to be able to examine an exit unless it was a door or a path (or something tangible).\"</p>\n<p>I think we both make valid points.</p>\n<p>If an author doesn't know what the target audience expects from a text adventure, he or she will not know which scenery objects are expected to exist.  Creating every little thing may be time-consuming, but it could mean the difference between placing 11th and placing 1st.</p>\n<p>The worst thing that could happen is players overlooking details added by the author, and they would probably discover those details on future play-throughs, which would add replay value to a game.</p>\n<p>I don't believe a player has ever complained about a game being too detailed (unless someone gets frustrated with red herrings).</p>\n<p>From a programmer's perspective, all bases should always be covered.</p>\n<p>From an artist's perspective, there are no bases except the ones he or she creates (and I would think those should be covered).</p>\n<p>In the end, I guess it boils down to trial and error.  Anyone with no (or little) experience who expects to create a work of art by following rules, guidelines, or advice will probably fail (with a few exceptions, of course).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What's the difference between these:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are in a room with whatever in the background.</p>\n<p>You can see a ball and a bat here.<br>\nYou can go north.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&gt;x the whatever<br>\nI can't see that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&gt;x the whatever<br>\nThis game does not understand the word 'whatever' in that context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&gt;x the whatever<br>\nNothing out of the ordinary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&gt;x the whatever<br>\nYou don't have time to go around examining whatevers all day!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&gt;x the whatever<br>\nIt's a very interesting looking whatever, but it doesn't look like something you'll need during this adventure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The difference to me is that those last two are somewhat entertaining -- not just the default response.  When I read entertaining things, I am entertained.  When I read default responses, I am not entertained.  The purpose of a game is to entertain the player.  Therefore, it seems like someone creating a game would want to supply entertaining responses for any command their prose might make the player want to enter.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, in my opinion (which is shared by many), if there are numerous objects mentioned which do not exist, that is a sign of a bad text adventure (unless it is an older game which had little space for objects and descriptions).</p>\n<p>Also, I don't view Quest games as text adventures unless the panes and hyperlinks are disabled.  With the hyperlinks and/or panes, I view them as Quest games, which are not unlike text adventures, but not true text adventures -- more like hypertext adventures.  With the hyperlinks and/or game panes, I can see how a player could be fine with a game that does not have scenery objects, as the important objects are clearly identified.</p>\n<p>David W, Silver, XanMag and myself (among others here) are always talking about text adventures in general, not Quest games in particular.

      "EditableText": "**FINAL THOUGHTS (EDITED)**\r\n\r\nby K.V.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nI hate to ignore a thread.  It seems rude.\r\n\r\n...but I don't think I can possibly come up with anything more to say that could add anything constructive after this.\r\n\r\nSo, this will be my last post in this thread, but only because I do not wish to \"beat a dead horse\", as the saying goes.  (No offense meant.)\r\n\r\n***For the record:***\r\n\r\nI do not think I've won a debate or anything, and I do not think anyone is completely wrong or completely right.\r\n\r\nNow, here are my final thoughts (and such):\r\n\r\n---\r\nI think the most important thing is to let the player know they are not playing traditional parser IF when (and/or before) play begins.\r\n\r\nI don't think this site will add a new category for parser games which purposefully omit scenery objects, and I'm even more certain that no other IF site (or community) would consider it.  Not at this juncture.  (Wouldn't be prudent.)\r\n\r\nHere's why I say that: 90% of text adventurers are expecting to lose themselves in an immersive world filled with prose, puzzles, frustration, and humorous responses.  We are choosing to play the most tedious and intricate of games: the text adventure.  We are choosing to put forth maximum effort, and we expect the author to do the same.\r\n\r\nIf authors want to make games which purposefully omit all scenery objects, that is their prerogative.  Knowing that the majority of the target audience will complain about this, said authors should make everything clear before the player enters the first command.  If this is done, and the game is still enjoyable, there should be no problem.  Emily Short has pulled this off once or twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n...but even Emily Short didn't attempt to add a new category for parser games such as this when she authored them, and she is a major contributor to Inform 7 and one of the most respected members of the IF community.\r\n\r\nShe knows the audience, and she knows we are more ornery and set in our ways than any other gaming crowd.  It's easier to just drop a game with special instructions on us than to attempt to persuade us that less is more.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't advise trying to convince anyone that less can be more, nor would I advise trying to get anyone to add a category for games which are considered substandard when you are purposefully doing what makes the games substandard, as this is an obvious ploy.\r\n\r\nJust make games.  Make them however you please.  If you choose to omit unimportant objects, just let that be known before the game actually starts.  \"Welcome, Adventurer!  I call this a 'foreground game'!  In this game, you only need to interact with items which are clearly marked by [WHATEVER].\"\r\n\r\nThat should stop the mods from Sandpitting the game.  After that, if your game is good, people will like it.\r\n\r\nIf multiple \"foreground\" games end up being popular, and lots of players are looking specifically for \"foreground games\", the rules of supply and demand dictate that a new category will come into existence.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'd like to take this time to point out that I am not being combative (or heated), although I can see how I could be taken that way.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, I'm only trying to help out.  My arguments are not just my opinions.  I'm putting out the opinions of the majority of the IF community.\r\n\r\nI'm also the kind of guy who lets someone know when I see them fighting for a lost cause.  I get no pleasure from this, besides knowing that I tried to help someone avoid wasting their time and energy only to be let down in the end.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the lost cause (from my perspective) is coming up with a new category.  \r\n\r\nThere seem to only be three people on this site who are pro \"foreground\" games:  DavyB, J_J, and the OP (even though the OP does not even seem to deem this discussion worthwhile).  Everyone else is pro \"complete\" games.  \r\n\r\nA few of us have conceded that sometimes a game can be considered \"acceptable\" (and sometimes even \"good\") when an author consistently lets the player know which objects should be ignored by somehow marking the important objects.  I think that's the best anyone could expect from this discussion.\r\n\r\nAgain, I am not at all trying to be mean or rude or anything like that.  There is no malice in me.  I'm just being honest.  The truth isn't always what we want to hear, but it's always what we need to hear.  (Anyone that says otherwise is lying.)\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe that your intentions are good, DavyB.  You are setting ground rules for the \"foreground\" games.  I see where you're coming from.  I'm just saying that I don't think anyone else but you (and possibly J_J) will want to move forward with this proposed sub-category.\r\n\r\n(I will say that allowing us (the authors and the players) to tag games with labels (and to create our own labels, just like on IFDB) would be great.  If we could do this, anyone could tag a game as a \"foreground game\", and then everyone could easily find them.  (I assume IFDB allows us to do this because it is much more efficient than creating hundreds of sub-categories.))\r\n\r\nSo, in summation, I'm not saying your ideas are bad.  I just think you should convince us with the games, not with the creation of a new category.  If you can provide enjoyable \"foreground\" games, the category \"foreground game\" will be forced into existence.  (Or that's how things seem to work these days, anyway.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n> **J_J said:**\r\nIn a graphic based game there is always a point where the world ends. There are always objects you can see in the background of the scene but you can't interact with. \"Look object\" in a text based game is a form of interacting with an object.\r\n\r\nIn a game with graphics, the player can literally see which objects are within reach.\r\n\r\nIn a text adventure, the player cannot see at all.  The player imagines the things which are provided in the descriptions.  When a thing is mentioned in a description, that tells the player it should exist in the imagination.  Telling the player that something exists when it does not actually exist is illogical.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAgain, I advise everyone to set the artist free.  Do whatever feels right.\r\n\r\n...just don't be surprised when purposefully doing less work than expected isn't met with praise, no matter how you package it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Some Words of Wisdom from Emily Short:\r\n\r\n***(These are only selections from these posts.  I implore everyone to read both posts in full.)***\r\n\r\nhttps://emshort.blog/2017/05/04/mailbag-the-endangered-art-of-parser-if/\r\n\r\n>You should write parser IF only if...\r\nPerhaps you are nostalgic for Infocom; perhaps you think parser is just so cool; perhaps you have a game concept that really fits parser and there’s just no better place to do it. Possibly you are tickled by a medium where you can spend half your time writing responses to commands like LICK PARROT. Maybe there’s something you aspire to learn about game design that you think parser IF could teach you.\r\n\r\n>. . .\r\n\r\n>A particular kind of control over prose. If you’re writing for parser IF, you have to know where you’re placing every noun, because every object you name to the player is a promise of future interactivity.

If you can do anything at the command prompt, where do you start?\r\n>\r\n>Yeah. That command prompt is a problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n>While I’m on the topic, I should mention that the parser isn’t a picnic for authors either. It’s thanks to that pesky command prompt that so much development time goes into implementing feedback for completely stupid and inane actions; and who among us hasn’t left in a bad response to >TOUCH MOON or >RUB PARROT, just because the possible combinations of verbs and nouns in our game world was too enormous to think through properly?\r\n>\r\n>These days there are some tools to help with that, and it’s often possible to tighten up the simulation in general rather than deal with every single annoying case individually — for instance, people making far-away things in Inform 7 could do worse than to check out Jon Ingold’s Far Away extension, which would let you designate the moon “far away” and then cope sensibly with all possible moon-fingering behavior.\r\n>\r\n>Still, a huge amount of creative overhead goes into the not-always-thrilling task of creating responses to commands that aren’t sensible, aren’t relevant to advancing the game or story, give the player no interesting character notes about the viewpoint character, deliver no jokey zingers, and are flat-out unlikely to be typed by anyone who isn’t actively trying to break the game.\r\n>\r\n>If you don’t work on that stuff, it makes the game look buggy and unpolished. Because it is buggy, because the player can make things happen that tear a giant hole in the illusion.\r\n>\r\n>But I’d be lying if I said I’ve never wondered why I was bothering, sometime during hour seven of implementing responses to the highly-unlikely instead of working on stuff the player is definitely going to see.\r\n\r\n>. . .\r\n\r\n>So what then? Do we pitch out the parser and go to a system in which the player’s options are clearly enumerated at all times?\r\n>\r\n>People have played with that idea too. Sometimes the approach is to fill a screen with lots of helps: a compass rose showing directions, a map, sometimes an image of the location, plus a menu or set of buttons representing all the major verbs available at any given moment.\r\n>\r\n>This can get overwhelming. If I’m playing a largely text-oriented game, I prefer not to have the window of text forced into a small corner of the screen while the rest of the territory is taken up with interaction helps. It’s unattractive — and it also represents a style of UI that’s rapidly becoming obsolete. More and more games in the commercial sector streamline away as much as they can in order not to crowd the player’s field of vision with things other than the screen in which the action is happening.\r\n\r\n> . . .\r\n\r\n>Another approach is to retain visual cues but embed them in the main text itself. [Bronze](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/oSQqFmpdsECJmQqns_iGQA/bronze) and Blue Lacuna both use the technique of highlighting (in bold or in color) important nouns in the text;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>",

It’s thanks to that pesky command prompt that so much development time goes into implementing feedback for completely stupid and inane actions; and who among us hasn’t left in a bad response to &gt;TOUCH MOON or &gt;RUB PARROT, just because the possible combinations of verbs and nouns in our game world was too enormous to think through properly?</p>\n<p>These days there are some tools to help with that, and it’s often possible to tighten up the simulation in general rather than deal with every single annoying case individually — for instance, people making far-away things in Inform 7 could do worse than to check out Jon Ingold’s Far Away extension, which would let you designate the moon “far away” and then cope sensibly with all possible moon-fingering behavior.</p>\n<p>Still, a huge amount of creative overhead goes into the not-always-thrilling task of creating responses to commands that aren’t sensible, aren’t relevant to advancing the game or story, give the player no interesting character notes about the viewpoint character, deliver no jokey zingers, and are flat-out unlikely to be typed by anyone who isn’t actively trying to break the game.</p>\n<p>If you don’t work on that stuff, it makes the game look buggy and unpolished. Because it is buggy, because the player can make things happen that tear a giant hole in the illusion.</p>\n<p>But I’d be lying if I said I’ve never wondered why I was bothering, sometime during hour seven of implementing responses to the highly-unlikely instead of working on stuff the player is definitely going to see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. . .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So what then? Do we pitch out the parser and go to a system in which the player’s options are clearly enumerated at all times?</p>\n<p>People have played with that idea too. Sometimes the approach is to fill a screen with lots of helps: a compass rose showing directions, a map, sometimes an image of the location, plus a menu or set of buttons representing all the major verbs available at any given moment.</p>\n<p>This can get overwhelming. If I’m playing a largely text-oriented game, I prefer not to have the window of text forced into a small corner of the screen while the rest of the territory is taken up with interaction helps. It’s unattractive — and it also represents a style of UI that’s rapidly becoming obsolete. More and more games in the commercial sector streamline away as much as they can in order not to crowd the player’s field of vision with things other than the screen in which the action is happening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. . .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another approach is to retain visual cues but embed them in the main text itself. <a href=\"https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/oSQqFmpdsECJmQqns_iGQA/bronze\">Bronze</a> and Blue Lacuna both use the technique of highlighting (in bold or in color) important nouns in the text;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n\n",
