I made a Youtube video once of a Chris Gaines song that I bought brand new on cd.  (I am not here to argue copy rights of ownership.)  In less then 24 hours my video was shut down and I had a warning from Youtube (which I found ironic) not to do it again.  I did a search of Youtube and at the time could not find a single Chris Gaines and as I recall, Garth Brooks video/song up.  However there were quite a few people playing and singing his songs.  I guess official videos are a no go, fan made videos are ok.\r\n\r\nSame with Saturday Night Live.  You just don't see them.  And some dramas on PBS can not be found on Youtube, only their trailers.
