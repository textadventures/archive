      "EditableText": "Hey,\n\n I stared playing around with your game today and I like your idea of switching characters. I have a question though... I went to switch my character to 'Tara the Thief' and it said 'You cannot choose her...she is dead!' This made me wonder why you had added her to the character list menu. Why add her if you can't switch? So I opened the game in QDK and found this..\n\n[quote:1lbwqi73]\nIf the flag &quot;tara dead&quot; is set  \nThen { Print &quot;Tara lies lifeless on the floor.&quot; } \nElse Print &quot;[SIZE 00]Tara is a slender brunette with a big cleavage.&quot; \n[/quote:1lbwqi73]\n\n After seeing the 'else' I figured that Tara's suppose to be alive, at least at the beginning of the game. That would allow you to switch to her character. The flaw is that under the [b:1lbwqi73]Game [i:1lbwqi73]setup[/i:1lbwqi73][/b:1lbwqi73] you have it to set up to 'Set the flag &quot;Tara dead&quot; to on'.\n\n Having said that, back to my question.. Is it supposed to be like that? Is she supposed to be dead at the beginning?\n\n***Edit***\n  \n Ah, I see. She IS supposed to be dead at the beginning. It took me a moment. Very good! I only have one suggestion..\n\nA) As you were going for a mouse driven style game, change it from 'look' at available characters, to 'use' available characters to show the \nmenu.\n\nB) You might like to add a global command for something like 'change character' to display the character list menu as well.\n\n Just a suggestion, and again good job!",
