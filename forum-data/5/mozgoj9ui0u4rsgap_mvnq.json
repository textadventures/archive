Did you have anyone playtest it for you other than family or friends who may not have wanted to offend you?\r\nHere is the opening text when played...\r\n```\r\nMT. PBLPHHTTTTTTTTTT\r\nJanuary 202X\r\nYou were an explorer, spelunking dangerously in a large, dark cave. It was just for fun, but then you fell.\r\nYou laid unconscious on the ground for some time, then slowly wake up.\r\nYou see a group of trolls. Green Trolls, and the Chief Troll.\r\nThere is a small underground reservoir, and a small river/stream leading out of there.\r\nBest to talk to someone.\r\nSuddenly, you smell something horrible. You spy a fish flopping on the ground.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**MT. PBLPHHTTTTTTTTTT** - Is this a typo, stuck 'T' on your keyboard, or something else. It is certainly not a pronounceable word in English or any other language for that matter. \r\n\r\n**January 202X**  - again, is this a typo or are you using some weird calendar system?\r\n\r\nIs this supposed to be past or present tense? You have both here.\r\nPast tense -  \"You **were** an explorer...\" and \"You **laid** unconscious...\" then in the same sentence you change to present tense - \"then slowly **wake up**\".\r\n**You see a group of trolls. Green Trolls, and the Chief Troll.** This would read better if it were a single sentence eg. \"You see a group of Green Trolls with the Chief Troll.\"\r\n\"**a small river/stream**\" - Decide which it is and then use only that. You are speaking like HK's posts.\r\n\"**Best to talk to someone.**\" - this sentence seems a little out of context. Is it meant to be a hint? Other than talking to yourself, who else is around that can talk? Certainly not the Trolls. (Can trolls talk? I suppose they can if you want them to but would you be able to understand them?)\r\n\"**Suddenly, you smell something horrible.**\" - If I was in a place with something that smelt horrible, I'm sure I would be aware of it from the start and not have it SUDDENLY attack my olfactory glands.\r\n\r\nFrom a start like this, I didn't want to go any further, so I quit.\r\n",
