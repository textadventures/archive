You are to be executed because you have been caught by and exposed to humans, endangering your kind and the multiverse. Your execution is in 5 minutes. What is your plan to escape?\r\n\r\nFrom the maker of \"Gilui & Orima\", this short game involves a minor character from that game before the events that unfolded in said game. This game is relatively quick and can be completed in 15-45 minutes depending on how you play the game. This game, just like \"Gilui & Orima\", may have some bugs, so report any bugs you find during your playthrough. This game is also a one-man project, so please be patient.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:**\r\nThis game contains the following:\r\n\r\nViolence (Torture towards person/child, gruesome depictions of murder, etc.)\r\nVehicular Manslaughter\r\nComic Mischief\r\nMild Language\r\nOther Possible Trigger Warnings (Gun violence)\r\n\r\nThis game is intended for those people 13 years old and up.
