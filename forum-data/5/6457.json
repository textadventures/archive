The only tool you have is a flashlight, which you can use to reveal clues about the game's story via notes. However, it might trigger the Beast into attacking in certain areas.\n\nYour only goal is to get out of the forest. There's no keys to find, no people to talk to, just get out before the Beast gets you.\n\nSound interesting? If you like this idea, check out the first The Beast here: [url:2lgg9yds]http&#58;//textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/games/view/hdbab1hoeeunmmdn38uoma/the-beast[/url:2lgg9yds] That's where I'll post announcements about Chapter Two until it's released.",
