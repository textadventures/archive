This is something I have been considering after refining the game a little bit. Watching Mattroks's youtube videos has been immensely entertaining but also a good way to find things I would like to improve about the game. \n\nSo thank you Mattroks! An update will definitely take into account such things as feeding the rat to the monkey, talking to yourself, and will include some more Pirate language. I would love to see you continue your videos!",
