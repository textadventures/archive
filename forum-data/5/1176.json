I usually start every game with an average score of 5 and then add points for every positive aspect about the game and take them away for every negative aspect. Here there were negative aspects all the way and no positives, hence the final score of 1. Sometimes if I've scored the game and found I've given it a 7, but didn't actually like the game, I'll adjust the score downwards.

Absolute masterpiece. Couldn't be improved on no matter what. The sort of game that everyone should strive to write.\n\n9 - Brilliant game but had a few flaws which prevented it getting a 10.\n\n8 - Very good game but several flaws or just not the best storyline.\n\n7 - Good game but probably let down by a few bugs, typos, weaknesses in plot, etc.\n\n6 - Above average but nothing particularly remarkable.\n\n5 - Average. Nothing good about the game, but nothing bad about it either.\n\n4 - Below average, though only just. Worth playing if you've got some time to kill but not recommended.\n\n3 - Poor. Bad storyline, lots of mistakes, atrocious spelling.\n\n2 - Terrible. Like 'poor' but even worse. Has almost nothing to recommend about it, but a few things that prevent it getting a 1.\n\n1 - Dire. The sort of game that needs to be avoided at all costs. Probably so littered with spelling mistakes as to be unreadable. So full of errors as to be unplayable. Most likely even the author wouldn't think this game was any good, although the authors of games this bad seldom take the time to explain why they wrote the game in the first place and didn't bother having it tested.\n\nSo far, I haven't given a single Quest game a rating of better than 4 and considering that the latest batch has so far yielded a 1 and 2, I'm not very hopeful of that changing any time soon.",
