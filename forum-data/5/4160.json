It got good reviews in the two leading Amstrad user magazines ([i:1btz433l]Amstrad Action[/i:1btz433l] and [i:1btz433l]Amstrad Computer User[/i:1btz433l]), and some pleasing responses from the 30 or so people who bought copies from me as a result.\n\nI have now made a Quest version using the original 8-bit pictures and Quest's alternative mouse-driven interface. I have also made a few minor adjustments to make the game more friendly to the player - in particular, avoiding the possibility of lock-outs.\n\nI believe this version is pretty robust, but I'm hesitant to call it a &quot;beta&quot; version without further testing. I would be grateful for comments of any kind, but especially for notification of any bugs, text errors, infelicities, or commands which should be provided for but are not.\n\nIf you're willing to act as a play-tester, and keep an &quot;issues log&quot;, please let me know through this forum and we can establish direct contact.",
