The game can be played at https://cruncha-cruncha.github.io/zork1-compiler but there's no way to save your progress. Any feedback is appreciated! I've been cooking this project for awhile, but wrote the actual game fairly quickly.",

I need to know I can't, for instance, climb a tree, but also, what I can do, if I can't climb a tree, not that I would have guessed I could, but not every game uses the same list of commands. Even some dead ends and red herrings are better, for me, at least, than nothing.The writing is really great. I love the descriptions of nature. Thank you for the link. I might try it again.",
