I've been working on a short text adventure game for a little while that I'm thinking of entering into IFComp in September, and I'm looking for playtesters who might want to try it out, see if it works, if it makes sense, and if it's any fun.  It's a short game called \"Night House\"; I think you could probably finish it in an hour or two, and it might appeal to fans of kids-in-supernatural-peril stories like \"The Gate\" or \"Stranger Things.\"\r\n\r\nThe basic stort is this: You're eight years old. You wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. But you soon realize that not everything is as it seems in this house tonight. Where has everyone gone? Things look different in the dark. Night House is an atmospheric horror text adventure about things that go bump in the night. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you'e interested in helping me out -- and, if so, let me know how's best to send you the game link. Thanks for reading!",
