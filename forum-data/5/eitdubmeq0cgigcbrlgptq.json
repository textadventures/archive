      "EditableText": "Hi guys, I'm Camero2K and a hobbyist game developer. I actually like Quest because it is a real training camp for people lacking graphic design (like me, of course). Now without further ado, let me present you my project \"Ghetto Grind\".\r\n\r\nIt's a (seemingly) typical \"ghetto type\" game made in text adventure, but I'm trying to keep the game inline with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas with plot, environment and gameplay. Currently the game is in alpha stage and has some decent things to do; like cooking meals (chicken, pasta, meat etc.), involving in gang fights, finding yourself new and (gradually) better jobs, interacting with environment and people and some realistic commands like sleeping and thinking.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the time of writing this entry, something remains buggy and gameplay remains largely cryptic. I'll add enough things to do and fix these issues and eventually release an alpha build of this game before advancing into beta status.\r\n\r\nAny ideas are welcomed.",
