      "EditableText": "Hey there. I have this question about the policy of publishing incomplete games for the purpose of allowing some friends who volunteered to test and provide feedback, while using the web player. I know I could just pass the .quest file, but I wish I could burden them the least possible, since they're already helping out of their own volition. After all, that would mean I had to ask them for download and install a program they don't know of. Plus, I guess that publishing the same entry after each update would be easier to manage.\n\nSo, is it ok or should I stick to presenting files after all? If so, are there any guidelines I must follow? I'm sorry if this has been answered already, but my searches turned nothing.",
