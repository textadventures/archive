In the Inventory screen it says &quot;Stew8&quot;.  I should only have one stew that I am aware of, I only did the stew quest once.  Is it a glitch or am I suppose to heal a different way?\n\nAlso is there a guide or at least something that shows all commands?  Me getting told I can not do something over and over again frustrates me enough to just stop playing.  I liked that there was the extra tab at the top for some special commands, like &quot;wield&quot; and &quot;mount&quot;, but nothing else.  Typing &quot;help&quot; only gives me very few of the generic commands.  I need something more in order to enjoy the game and story please.  Thank you.",
