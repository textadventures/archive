I'm looking for somewhere between 4 - 6 people so that we can get some usability feedback on the user interface being developed. If you're interested, please reply on this thread or PM me with your reason for why you'd like to be a playtester and once I've got the people I need I'll close this thread.\n\nThere is a couple of conditions to being a playtester for this game. First, you can't discuss the game with anyone except the developers (myself and Jay Nabonne). Second, you can't share the link to the online test with anyone. We're not quite ready to go public with the information of the game and depending on how much time I have, I might have some NDA's drafted up to be signed before the link is sent out to the testers.\n\nDon't let that discourage you though, it's just to protect us and the project until things are ready to be revealed! I look forward to working with a few of you in the near future!",
