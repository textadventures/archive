But I don't think it promotes laziness. I think it is possible to think of games as being mouse driven, or text driven, or a combination of both. Your computer comes with a mouse, why not use it? It should become obvious how to proceed as a player in each game, based on the way the game is devised. Some games are entertaining, with a minimal amount of verbs, so that you can play with the mouse only. As an example, if you are say 80% through a game and have only used your mouse, and then you introduce a verb like &quot;eat&quot;...and say it is the only instance it is used in the game...I think that takes away from game play. I made a mouse-driven game, but I alerted the players before starting of this, so that they could concentrate more on the minimal amount of verbs and push the keyboard aside. I had to risk the temptation of creating the verb &quot;eat&quot; for my game, so I compromised and developed a different game-playing strategy for the idea to proceed.\n\nNow on the other hand, if you immediately start a game with verbs like &quot;jump&quot; &quot;eat&quot; &quot;block&quot; &quot;grab&quot; etc...you would probably push the mouse to the side altogether and play exclusively with your keyboard. I might try this approach in my next game to utilize a bigger universe of verbs and possibilities for the game player.\n\nSo really, I think you can have the best of both worlds.",
