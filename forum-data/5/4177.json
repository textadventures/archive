Some of my friends have play tested the alpha version looking for broken scripts, etc. and I think I've caught them all.  However, most of my friends aren't very experienced with nor truly appreciate text games, and I'm getting a lot of metaphorical pats on the back and congratulations for a game that I know has tons of room for improvement.  So I'm about halfway between an alpha version and beta version of the game, I've tapped out most of my feedback resources and so I'm asking for some help.\n\nThe game is primarily focused around puzzles and exploration, there isn't truly much of a plot.  If you are interested, please just reply to this thread and I can PM you with a copy of the online link.  You are welcome to download it from there.  This will of course only be shared with the agreement that as a tester you won't share the link, steal code/puzzles/etc., and will give me honest feedback and constructive criticism.  All skill/experience levels are welcome, but experienced IF players will be particularly appreciated.  All play testers will be credited in an in-game about page by their preferred name.",

I'm in a final push to get this WIP into release so that I don't feel as bad devoting time to my newer WIPs without sending my first game into the wild.  I would really like to be able to say that I have 'finished' something that is as workable, as fully implemented, and hopefully as enjoyable to play as I am able.\n\n&quot;Wake Up&quot; is my first attempt at making a game. It is largely an exercise in implementing puzzles in a parser based work of IF. As such, it is puzzle-oriented with very little story. It is short and I expect that it could be completed in 30-45 minutes, depending on how long it takes a person to figure out the puzzles.\n\nMost of my previous testers have flaked out on me and none have completed the game (most very new/inexperienced with IF) although the first 1/3 of the game has been fairly thoroughly tested and I have secret commands to help skip sections for easier testing, if desired.
