Avalon was ahead of its time from the start, originating concepts and features that have since become staples of the MUD, online RPG and MMORPG genres – virtual economies, skills, abilities, classes, guilds, player housing, cooldowns, weather effects, player-run organisations and skill based PVP combat to name but a few.

The Pearl is one of the fifteen divine gems, its winner will obtain great powers over the &quot;Voodoo Firmament&quot; and contender status for Ordination. Contenders have the right to compete for the chance to become an Avalon deity in their own right - in the most competitive, challenging quest of any game, anywhere.\n\nThe format for the quest will be battle-sands; competition for the sands of time (a capture the flag style event). This is a junior inclusive format. All can participate and all can perform to a high level even if new to Avalon. There is no better learning experience nor opportunity to ride the rollercoaster of passions that collide in this most unique of game worlds - almost 26 real years old with unbroken continuity. \n\nAll with an interest can JOIN GEMQUEST in Avalon.
