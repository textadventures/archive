      "EditableText": "With my thirst for appallingly crap games satisfied â€“ thanks muchly to â€œSword Masters: Get Out Of The Houseâ€, â€œThe Tavernâ€ and â€œDoomed!â€ who definitely satisfied by thirst for a long, long time to come â€“ I decided to turn my attentions to better games. Good games? Wellâ€¦ better than the previous three I mentioned anyway. Here I went to the top games on the Quest archive and saw this little gem peering out at me amidst all the other little gems. It cried at me to download it and write a review telling everyone it really wasnâ€™t all that good. I was only too happy to oblige.\n\nI was impressed with the attention to detail in the accompanying READ ME which begins with â€œwelpâ€ and then informs me that itâ€™s not called a standard READ ME file because there are â€œfillionsâ€ of them around already. Fillions, eh? Thatâ€™s a lot. After amusing myself with these bizarre typos, I decided Iâ€™d put it off long enough and went to the game itself.\n\nI ran into problems quite soon. On my first command in fact. I was prompted to type HELP, did so, and found myself looking at a little pop-up window (nasty idea!) which was full of black text. On a black background. Hmmâ€¦ In one way, this is an effective, if slightly unconventional, way of ensuring as many people as possible quit your game as soon as possible and thus donâ€™t become even more disappointed with the gameâ€™s many other problems. On the other hand, it doesnâ€™t pose much of a problem to those of us with a cut &amp; paste command and an empty Word document. Now I'm not sure if this was the authorâ€™s fault, Questâ€™s fault or simply me changing the default colours of Quest and blindly assuming that it wouldnâ€™t be daft enough to try displaying black text on a black background. Even more impressive is the way one of my next commands â€“ X ROAD MAP â€“ produces another pop-up window, this time a white one withâ€¦ nothing inside. Even cut &amp; paste didnâ€™t help me here.\n\nVisually-challenged player characters seem to be a favourite in Quest games from what I have seen and here is no exception. In the hospital, I am advised to take a brochure from the front desk, however the game then advises me that I CANâ€™T SEE THAT ANYWHERE. I'm told the same thing when trying to examine the front desk. However â€“ and here the authors have begun to get into their stride â€“ there *is* a description for the coat rack. Nice. On the down side, the jackets hanging on the coat rack are invisible but I guess one description for an entire location is a step up from the standard I've come to expect.\n\nThe game goes out of its way to bug me. Location descriptions will be different depending on whether you just entered a location â€“ in which case you see a nice long description â€“ or whether you're in the location and just typing LOOK â€“ in which case you see a very short description. Often you need to exit the location and then re-enter it to see the full description as apparently the game interprets the LOOK command as â€œdonâ€™t show me everything I can LOOK at, just the basicsâ€. Still, on the positive side of things, the authors have decided not to include descriptions of anything you can see in the longer descriptions so itâ€™s not like you're really missing anything.\n\nIn an attempt to elevate this game to the lofty â€œnot thatâ€ instead of â€œa steaming pile ofâ€ on the Crap-O-Meter, the authors have taken great care to customise some of the room descriptions. Now Quest has an annoying habit of churning out default room descriptions that sound like a robot wrote them: all very mechanical, to the point and with every last ounce of warmth or depth thoroughly murdered. This problem is then often made worse by the author of pretty much every Quest game I've ever played deciding to repeat this description in the actual body of the text. So you'll often be told the same thing twice which doesnâ€™t do wonders for the gameâ€™s chances of ending up with anything more than a 1 out of 10 on the â€œis it any good?â€ scale. Here at least some effort has been expended to try and flesh out the descriptions to give the impression that they were written by real living human beings and not some faceless android. It succeedsâ€¦ sometimes. Not all the time but at least itâ€™s a start. \n\nOf course, at other times, in an effort to convince people that bad games are cool, the authors have decided to plonk wonderful location descriptions like the following ones down:\n\nW. ELM STREET PARKING.\nYOU CAN GO NORTH.\n\nAnd\n\nPRINT STREET PARKING.\nYOU CAN GO NORTH OR SOUTH.\n\nOh yes, filler locations. The bane of all that is good and proper in a text adventure. Whereas most people these days try and construct their games so that every location has a purpose, some still seem to enjoy the idea of filler locations. The purpose of these is simple: they have no purpose. They're just there. Why, the author wonders, should I have one location of use next to another location of use? Why, the author then wonders, shouldnâ€™t I have 17 empty and pointless locations between them? Why, the author concludes, donâ€™t I fill those locations withâ€¦ nothing at all? And so he does. And thatâ€™s why we have filler locations. On the plus side, they give the game the distinct impression of being a lot bigger than it really is without the author having to go to the effort of writing any more actual game. On the down side, they nudge it firmly out of the â€œnot thatâ€ category and into the â€œa steaming pile ofâ€ category.\n\nThen again, a lot of the locations in the game seem to be merely filler locations as there isn't actually anything to do in them. Take, for example, the second location I visited: the Laundromat, which is described as:\n\nHERE IS THE LAUNDROMAT.\nYOU CAN GO SOUTH.\n\nThe lengthier description you see when you first enter the location mentions several other things of interest, but, as with most of the things of interest in the game, the authors seem to have decided that they're not interesting enough to warrant a description. So no examining the Laundromat itself, no examining the washers, no examining the front counter or the mint on the counter. No taking the mint. No using the washers. In fact, try as I might, I couldnâ€™t find a single thing to do here. Hmmâ€¦\n\nAs the game progressed, I found myself recruited by the local mafia. The recruitment process was an amazingly complex and long drawn out one, no doubt designed to root out potential undercover cops and ensure the mafia heads remain safe, and involved me entering a tavern, being asked by a chap called Vinnie if I wanted to dehumanise people, and then â€“ lo and behold! â€“ I was a fully-fledged member of the mafia. Yes, it was certainly complicated this induction-into-the-mafia lark. Impressed with myself at the ease at which I had infiltrated this highly secretive gang of professional criminals, I went out on my first mission: I had to kill Red Jacket. Thatâ€™s actually an item of clothing worn by the victim and not the victim himself, by the way, though as the game wonâ€™t let you refer to the victim by anything other than Red Jacket, I found myself thinking of him in this way. Mr. Red Jacket, I thought to myself, your days are numbered and then I proceeded to blast away at him with my pistol.\n\nOr tried to anyway. Only just when the game seemed to have managed to lever itself out of the â€œa steaming pile ofâ€ category and into the â€œnot thatâ€ category, it went and hit me left, right and centre with an unholy torrent of guess the verb problems:\n\n&gt; SHOOT MAN\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMAND. TYPE HELP FOR A LIST OF VALID COMMANDS.\n\n&gt; SHOOT MAN WITH PISTOL\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMAND. TYPE HELP FOR A LIST OF VALID COMMANDS.\n\n&gt; SHOOT RED JACKET WITH PISTOL\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMAND. TYPE HELP FOR A LIST OF VALID COMMANDS.\n\n&gt; SHOOT RED JACKET\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMAND. TYPE HELP FOR A LIST OF VALID COMMANDS.\n\n&gt; USE PISTOL\nYOU CAN'T USE THAT HERE.\n\n&gt; USE PISTOL ON RED JACKET\nYOU PULL THE GUN SILENTLY OUT OF YOUR JACKET AND FIRE. THE SHOT HITS THE MAN IN THE NECK AND HE FALLS TO HIS KNEES AND THEN FALLS OVER.\n\nBy the time I finally hit upon the correct command to pull this off, I was more than ready to shoot myself in despairâ€¦ only I couldnâ€™t figure out the command so shooting poor Mr. Red Jacket was the only choice left to me. Impressively, Mr. Red Jacket did a rather remarkable disappearing act after I shot him and I was unable to find his corpse. Had he perhaps not been quite dead even though Iâ€™d shot him in the neck? Had he stumbled away and hidden somewhere out of sight and the game just decided not to tell me? Had he simply vanished into thin air at the moment of the bulletâ€™s impact? I had visions of the pistol I was firing being so inhumanly powerful that it could obliterate a red jacketed man with a single shot. This, I felt, would be a seriously cool weapon to have.\n\nWhatever the truth of the situation, Mr. Red Jacket was clearly not a red jacket-wearing man that anybody really missed as I approached him in broad daylight in the middle of the street and shot him dead with my pistol and no one seemed to be particularly concerned. Or even noticed it had happened. I even stood around afterwards wondering if the cops were going to show up and arrest me for this heinous crime, but clearly they werenâ€™t bothered either. Then again, with no corpse around (handy things these disappearing corpses!) there was little they could get me on save having a smoking gun in public.\n\nOn my way back to the mafia headquarters, still with a smoking gun in my hand, I am questioned by a police officer who isn't, to be kind, the brightest spark. She questions me about the shooting on Elm Street (apparently they found the invisible corpse after all, clever cops) and, even though I'm standing there with a loaded gun in my hand, she lets me go when I say I didnâ€™t hear anything. My god. I know standards in the modern police force are said to be slipping, but *this*â€¦\n\nAs you might have gathered from the fact that I played this far into the game without either a) slitting my wrists or b) firing the game into the recycle bin at slightly less than the speed of light, I didnâ€™t hate Assassin quite as much as the previous three Quest games Iâ€™d played. Actually no, thatâ€™s not strictly speaking true. To say itâ€™s a good game would be wildly misleading. In truth itâ€™s pretty darn awful, but there's just something so bad about it that itâ€™s almost good. Itâ€™s like a horrible car crash of a game that you know is going to be something you donâ€™t want to see, but itâ€™s purely *because* itâ€™s so horrible that you keep on looking at it. I have to admit, I had a good chuckle at the idea of someone being recruited into the mafia by simply wandering into a tavern and answering a simple question. Even more chucklesome was the police officer questioning me about a shooting and not even seeming suspicion of the smoking gun in my hand. But even that was topped by my next assignment which involved me heading to the park and reading a note that had a mafia sign on itâ€¦ in plain view of anyone who happened to wander past! The note even advises me â€“ this being the note thatâ€™s been left out in plain sight â€“ to acquire for myself a bomb and blow up a possible police base. While I'm at it, I might as well head along to the police station and turn myself in. It'll be quicker for me that way.\n\nUnfortunately, by this stage I had begun to have the sneaking suspicion that the game wasnâ€™t really very good. This was built up by a number of factors, but the main one seemed to be simply the feeling I had had right from the start that it was, well, a bit crap. I was tempted to carry on playing till I finished the game, but even though this was a step up from the masterpiece of interactive fiction that was â€œThe Tavernâ€, itâ€™s still not the kind of game I really wanted to be playing for any great length of time. Itâ€™s nearly got the makings of a half decent game here, and comes close to being amusing at times â€“ though never intentionally â€“ but there's a definite feeling that itâ€™s only been half finished. Why the empty locations? Why the multitude of items that canâ€™t be examined? Why are the mafia and the cops in the single figure IQ bracket? \n\nOn the Quest archive, the game boasts many scores of 4 and 5 (out of 5) and reviews which claim great things about it. Unfortunately, there must be two different versions of the game and I, cursed with bad luck as I am, picked the stinker to play. Anyone out there who has played the masterpiece which warrants 4 and 5 (out of 5), could you please send me a copy of the game as the one I downloaded would be extremely lucky to get a 2 out of 5.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I can think this one is safely out of the â€œa steaming pile ofâ€ category and into the â€œnot thatâ€ category on the Crap-O-Meter, but itâ€™s still kind of hard to recommend anyone play it unless they're actively seeking out bad games for one reason or another.\n\n2 out of 10",

I use it to print the skills, etc in my new battle code I'm making, to print two per line, it lines with the values so with the skill name before so they all start at the same place and then does that again on the line two make two.
