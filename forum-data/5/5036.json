I like how you're writing it in the third person where as most people write in the second person. I like the bar at the top that houses the commands that the player would need permanent access to and I like how you did away with compass directions choosing an alternative way of navigating. Are you planning on completing it? I'm a bit down on demos tbh. I understand the want to get feedback but you're asking people to invest time in a game that they won't be able to finish which is a job for testers rather than players.",

I always appreciate feedback.  Because of the scope of the project, the end product only required the demo.  I also produced the story of the rest of the game, it just hasn't been built yet.  I've kind of been living with this project for a while, so I'm probably going to step away from it for a time.  I wrote a 185 page research paper (~30 pgs of research and ~155 pgs of Design Document) to tag along with the game.  It's required a bit more of an investment than the typical project.  All that said, the demo itself is actually a fairly complete mini-story.  It doesn't just end randomly.  Hopefully, it ends both satisfyingly and leaving the player interested in more.  Depending on your play style, I put runtime between 30-60 minutes, maybe more if you're new to the style or intentionally take a long time with it.  The point here, though, isn't really that I'm looking for playtesters (though, again, feedback is always appreciated!).  I've just worked on bringing this story to life as much as I could, and now I'm sharing it with anyone interested.  Hopefully that satisfies some of your concerns?",

I know how to get rid of the location bar - it can be done in the game settings but then a blue bar keeps popping up on the top of the screen with the save button on it. I see you got rid of it successfully on your game (how will people save their game, btw?) so was just wondering how you did that? I suspect the code I've been given to do it is right, but there's some other setting I have which re-triggers it. Grrr lol.",
