What I'd like to do is establish a set of submission guidelines first, and then set a date.  Depending on how many stories are submitted by that date, the competition will go ahead.  I see a minimum of three entries as validation for the commencement of the competition.\n\nAs for &quot;best NPC interaction&quot;, I'm not sure that's practical in light of the limitation of the stories to be submitted:  one-room games won't necessarily include any NPC's at all.  I think more generic measures of merit are required, as already mentioned - grammar, spelling, difficulty, technique, style, etc.  The idea is that if you know a complete solution to a one-room story, you could finish it in roughly sixty seconds (probably faster).  This is not to say that you couldn't have an NPC, just that there is a good chance some games won't include them.  If you do have really neat NPC interaction, you may get a high score for technique or originality or story, but not for 'NPC Interaction'.\n\nOne requirement I would like is that, if you submit your game as a compiled file (because you don't want people to snoop), you release an open ASL version of it after the competition.  This is so that people can learn how you did what you did (whether you created your story through the QDK or not).\n\nAs to a kilobyte size limit, certainly one of the draws of this competition is that it doesn't have you commit to months of work.  You can whip up your idea in an afternoon, and then spend a week or two taking care of all the little stuff.  This promotes attention to detail, which you can then incorporate into any larger stories that you write later.  So hopefully no one is thinking of submitting a monstrosity.  I don't know that a size limit is necessary to enforce at this point (although you may argue to the contrary and change my mind).\n\nSo here is what I think is absolutely necessary to grade:\n\nLiteracy (as mentioned previously)\nStory (a subjective catch-all)\nDifficulty (too hard, too easy, just right)\n\nThose can of course be split into sub-categories if needed  Are there any other areas I'm missing?  Everyone feel free to chime in about submission guidelines and grading measures.  I'm open to anything and everything.",

If for some reason you cannot get a PayPal account, but want to enter the competition, chime in.  We'll figure something out.\n\n--------\n\nSubmission guidelines:\n\n1) Story must consist of one &quot;room&quot; only.  &quot;Room&quot; means a location, so any location is valid, not just an enclosed living space.\n2) No directional commands are allowed - save as a winning move.  As soon as one moves to another location, the game is won.  (* Alternate rule below - please weigh in.)\n3) All stories must be plain ASL.\n4) There is no size limit; ASL file may be of any length; story may be of any duration.\n5) You may submit your story as many times as you want until the deadline:  [b:o89y7std]midnight of May 3rd, 2009[/b:o89y7std].  That's a Sunday, so you've got a &quot;crunch&quot; weekend nearing the due date.\n6) Stories are submitted to my email account:  private message me for the email address.  (I will post all the stories on a Google Sites website.  They're easy to create, free, and look nice.)\n7) If you have more than one file (because you're including libraries, or just breaking up the parts of your game into smaller pieces) then zip them up into one file.  Google Sites doesn't allow the posting of files with a .lib extension - I guess for security reasons.\n\n* 2B) No directional commands are allowed - save as a winning or losing move.  As soon as one moves to another location, the game is either won or lost.  (In any event, the story concludes.)  Anyone have feedback on this?\n\n--------\n\nJudging guidelines:\n\n1) You cannot judge your own story.\n2) If you judge one story, judge them all.\n3) Try to judge all stories with the same level of scrutiny.  Know thyself.  If you mark many submissions in a row, your judgements may begin to jade.  Or not - your cognitive fortitude may be stronger than mine.  Just attempt to be fair.  (There is a purely subjective mark (story) in which you have a lot of leeway, but the other two marks (literacy &amp; playability) should be as objective as possible.)\n4) We will judge all the stories openly in the Quest forums.  Each story writer/group should create a thread in the Quest Games section for their story called &quot;OneRoom Submission:  [i:o89y7std]Story Title[/i:o89y7std]&quot;.  Perhaps a little intro post by the author(s) would be nice, too.  Only create this thread after you have submitted at least one version of your story.\n5) Judge a story once, and post your scores in the thread for that story.\n6) Please do not respond to judgements, whether of your own submission or others, in the submission threads.  (I can't enforce this - just asking.)  Rather, start another thread.  Perhaps the moderators could come up with some suitable rules.\n5) You do not need to have entered the competition in order to judge.\n6) Judging will commence on May 4th, and last 2 weeks.\n7) Total individual scores for games are out of 30.  The average of all your scores is your final grade.\n8) Any scores received by a judge who did not score all the stories will be disregarded.\n\n--------\n\nScoring guidelines:\n\nOffer a mark out of 10 for the following three categories:\n\n1) Literacy\n\nAll stories start off with the full 10 marks.  Any spelling, punctuation, or grammar errors you see deduct 1 mark.  OneRoom entries are small, so be nice to your sentences.\n\n2) Story\n\nThis is entirely subjective.  You may mark this however you see fit.  One person may find the story compelling, another cliche.  You may mark the story not just by its content, but by the manner in which it was told, the techniques used to convey the progression, etc.  For example, where some may like a surreal, doesn't-make-sense menagerie, others may not.  It's up to the judge.  \n\n3) Playability\n\nWas it a chore to play this story?  Too hard, too easy, just right, etc.  Did the story solution rely on sufficient clues, messages, and/or common sense - or was it impossibly obscure?  A simple example of where one should lose a mark for playability:  the player can 'get paper towel' but not 'get towel' or 'pick up paper towel'.  An example of obscurity:  you must speak the words &quot;bazzle-be-boo&quot; in order for the magical door to open, but no clue, message, common sense, or other indicator exists as to why this must be the case.\n\nThe best way to monitor your playability is to get others unfamiliar with your story to play it.  Since your story is short, it shouldn't be much of a bother for them anyhow.\n\n--------\n\nAlright, all the above is open to discussion and is mutable.
