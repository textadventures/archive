      "EditableText": "Ok. I don't know if i should be already typing this, but lets go.\n\nI did buy the game, but only played it for 15 minutes, what means i cannot talk much about the story itself.\n\nThe best things are the images and the sound track. The images are very competent. I do not think it should deserve an award, as illustration, but it is very cool. The sound track is the best. Very interesting and looks to be very well used.\n\nMay people here already pointed the text problems. I believe it begins when you can only get introduction movie on Russian or whatever be that language. Polish, perhaps? You may only change game to English after the opening video, what suggests there is not an English option. Ok, lets move on. It doesn't matters.\n\nBut, hey? Why doesn't matters? Because as you can feel at the very beginning of the game, there is only a barely believable argument for the character entering into a castle and steal everything. The game was designed to be a dungeon crawling without many motivations or character deep development. The character is treated as &quot;our hero&quot;, what means it has absolutely no name. No personality. No nothing. It is ok for old games and many theorists even prefer this lack of character, as it allows player to fill the gaps himself / herself. However the game also gives you no motivation. The idea is you get inside and steal everything. &quot;Here&quot; her is a dubious term, as the guy is a burglar. \n\nThen problems follows. One guy somewhere pointed it was a crap having to click on text in order to scroll it down. Actually, i thing is not an issue at all. The real problem is that the player gets absolutely vey few texts and very few information. The game offers at each step two or three options where the player must just guess things. There is no real information. Do you want to get the skeleton's sword, the game asks? &quot;I don't know&quot; is the most proper option - not possible in the actual game - because you have just a clue abou the character's items based on the pictures displayed. The dungeon crawling games simply lacks a system where player would base choices knowing about the character. As the text also gives no clues, the player must just guess about the options. This is very uncomfortable.\n\nAs a good point, there is always a picture illustrating every single scene, and every single move. The artist worked a lot for this game, and actually did a good job!\n\nYou may only expect to be walking around a huge castle as monsters pops in front of &quot;our hero&quot; as the player must guess how to deal with them. Each scene has not many steps. I mean, when planning what i call myself &quot;conflicts&quot; - a situation where player must make choices in order to outcome any kind of oppositions, be it a fight, a discussion, a persuasion task - there are steps. You win this little particle of the conflict and takes an edge, and then goes to the next step until you get victory somehow. Most of the conflicts are split into two steps or &quot;all or nothing&quot; steps. Do not even bother trying to figure out if there is a certain course of action more effective. There is no system to encourage you acting a given way or a good text indicating what would be best doing.\n\nIn short, the game has impressive props and a very competent design. But a poor planning. And a terrible text. Seems while a team was working on good pictures and an inspiring music, the head developer was concerned about making it big. Just big, like the old times quality measure for parser games - the number of rooms!",

I don't know if i should be already typing this, but lets go.<br/><br/>I did buy the game, but only played it for 15 minutes, what means i cannot talk much about the story itself.<br/><br/>The best things are the images and the sound track. The images are very competent. I do not think it should deserve an award, as illustration, but it is very cool. The sound track is the best. Very interesting and looks to be very well used.<br/><br/>May people here already pointed the text problems. I believe it begins when you can only get introduction movie on Russian or whatever be that language. Polish, perhaps? You may only change game to English after the opening video, what suggests there is not an English option. Ok, lets move on. It doesn't matters.<br/><br/>But, hey? Why doesn't matters? Because as you can feel at the very beginning of the game, there is only a barely believable argument for the character entering into a castle and steal everything. The game was designed to be a dungeon crawling without many motivations or character deep development. The character is treated as &quot;our hero&quot;, what means it has absolutely no name. No personality. No nothing. It is ok for old games and many theorists even prefer this lack of character, as it allows player to fill the gaps himself / herself.
