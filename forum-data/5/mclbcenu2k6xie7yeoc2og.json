I will double check the maze, but the first sequence is in working order. I don't know which games don't work for or you yet, but  I understand your need to work on your own game.  I am playing Thalassa's Thicket and it is playing through without hitches on my phone. I had it freeze after playing Fidget Gadget the match three game that makes matches up to Fifty something matches when making a negative match that coste the upgrade, but the way I see it, it is impressive that it plays at all over the phone with my own connection. I can barely pressIm not a robot in this forum, so, a freeze at that time is not unexpected. The second bed plays well. It is just a looped animation with a changing story, so that every time you sl3ep you can have a different \"dream\" or story.  It plays well now, but the problem before was lag, so you may be getting lag, but I'm not anymore. I fixed the maze. If it still has something wrong with it, I will find it. Mind you, it won't be easy to clean house over the phone and I need to clean the cabins to find the seeds.",
