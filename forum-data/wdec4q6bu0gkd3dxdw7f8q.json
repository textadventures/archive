Basically, one track would play and then the game would start a different track when the player clicks on a link, but I want the second track track to \"line up\" instead of just abruptly playing.\r\nMy idea is to play multiple tracks from the start, with all but one being muted. Then when a link is clicked, a different track is unmuted and the first one is muted, so they're effectively \"switched out\".\r\nI tried this on Scratch before, and it _mostly_ worked except for some lag caused by, well, Scratch being Scratch.\r\nAnyway, I'd like to know how to do this using Squiffy. I imagine my method might also be laggy, though, due to the multiple songs playing at once. If you guys have a better idea then please let me know.",
