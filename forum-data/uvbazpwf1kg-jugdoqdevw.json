Either free choice, dice division, or spending character points\r\n   * You can declare any attribute to be a 'character points' attribute, which can then be divided between other attributes\r\n   * Arithmetic, geometric, or exponential points cost\r\n4. **Choose an object** (eg class, race, starting equipment)\r\n   * Question object contains a number of 'answer' objects\r\n   * Allow pick-one/pick-up-to-X/pick-any-number/points-cost\r\n   * Flags to select some or all of:\r\n     * Copy the object's name or reference into an attribute of the player\r\n     * Move the object itself into the inventory\r\n     * Move the object's children into the inventory\r\n     * Copy the object's attributes (or a list of attributes) onto the player object\r\n       * Adding them together if the player already has such an attribute\r\n5. **Derived stats**\r\n   * An attribute that is generated using either a text-processor string, or a script attribute\r\n   * This \"question\" doesn't actually ask the player anything; it just calculates the attribute\r\n   * Can dynamically set up changedscripts (copies script attributes from the question to the player object once the base stats are configured)\r\n   * Can have semi-derived stats; allows spending character points to add on points.\r\n6. **Message**\r\n   * Display a message and wait before asking the next question\r\n7. **Choose Question**\r\n   * Optionally display a summary of stats so far\r\n   * Can allow the choice of which question comes next.

      "EditableText": "> Questions might depend on previous answers. If the player chooses to play a race with a tail, ask about the tail, otherwise skip it.\r\n\r\nI figure my system already allows that. In most cases, because a race is a complex thing that will affect multiple stats, you'd have it as a \"Choose an object\" question; a set of child objects representing the base stats of different races. If you set it to move their child objects into the inventory, then you could put the \"Tail length\" question inside one of them, and it gets added to the queue as soon as it's in the player.\r\n\r\nIf it's enabled by multiple races, you could either have the tail question's \"before\" script invalidate the question if not needed; or have the race question's \"after\" script move it in or out of the player object as needed. The question objects will sit around as invisible objects as long as their canundo flag is set.\r\n\r\n> This is kind of looking at it from the other side, but I prefer to see all the questions at once so I can build a holistic character.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about some kind of container for questions that displays several at once. For menus, that might be tough, but I think I can see a way to do it. (ShowMenu is non-blocking ☺. I was already playing with a similar system to take \"Skip question\", \"Help\", and \"Back\" options off the end of a ShowMenu call and displaying them as buttons rather than list items; while still keeping the scripts on them the same so that I don't need to edit ShowMenu or the parser code that deals with responses)\r\n\r\nHaving JS question widgets (especially for the numbers) would be good too… might leave that until I've got basic functionality, though.\r\nOr… I could make everything look like a menu.
