An object in the player's inventory is not technically in the current room, which is why the disambiguation fails. I'll add an extra check for &quot;take&quot; so it prints a sensible error.\n\n2. When adding an object to a container that hasn't been looked at yet, the container contents are still hidden. I suppose adding something to a container should trigger a &quot;look&quot; at its contents if they've not been seen already - if there was something already in the container, you would logically see that when adding something else to it.\n\n3. There's nothing stopping you from creating a loop in a chain of parents.\n\nI'll add these to the list for v4.1.",
