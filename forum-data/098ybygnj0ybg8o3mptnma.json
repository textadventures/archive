      "EditableText": "Hi\r\nIf I wanted to add some visuals to Quest, could I do that with the source, and if so, what am I looking for? I've got VS2017 to build with, and I mean actually editing the editor to add visual features. I don't care that they won't carry over to a game. I just want to add custom touches to the interface if possible. I realize I will have to do my own updating in the future too.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I wanted to take screenshots of what each Theme looked like when it was applied to a game, I could shrink them down and display them in the lower right corner of the editor pane as each theme is selected. Or how each of the Pane themes looks in the same manner. That sort of thing. It's nothing that affects any processing code, other than to add an extra option field to the drop down boxes.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n- Raist",
