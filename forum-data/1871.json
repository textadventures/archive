Now when I use &quot;Speak to&quot; option, everything says &quot;Gobbedly Gook!...&quot;  I have a Standard Message set, but more importantly, I have a verb set for an object for Speak To with a message attached, but neither print... just &quot;Gobbedly Gook&quot;.  Didn't have this problem before.  Anyone else come across this? Figure it out?",

If you can read my recent thread on &quot;Sounds&quot; not working correctly, and look at that, that would be a great help too.",
