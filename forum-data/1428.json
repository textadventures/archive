For example, if the lights are out, no movement is available.  If you turn on the lights, all possible movements are available.\n\nI would like to have a global command that will allow &quot;goto&quot; to be allowed in the place of &quot;go to&quot;.  Is this possible?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAlf",
