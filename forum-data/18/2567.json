Check the attribute &quot;being_worn&quot; to determine if the item is being worn in a script.\n\nThis is up for people to try out and comment on. I have tried to make it easy for language support, but I am not sure what you do aboyt the commands themselves. It includes a very simple example (one room, two objects). See what you think.",

There seems to be a problem with how templates are handled when used with square brackets, so I have changed the code to call the Template function directly (this makes it easy to change responses, say if translating to another language). Should have no effect on existing games.",

Just a small bug, or maybe an error on my part, I'm not sure.",
