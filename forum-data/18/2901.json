As it is now, I can equip clothing on the other characters, but if I try to remove said clothing it will activate the verb but then print nothing... no error message, nada, zip. This leaves characters with clothes just stuck to them, and multiple clothing sets (it's an RPG) is something pretty integral to the game.\n\nSo, does anyone have any idea how to go about modifying the library to support multiple player characters? After opening it up, i'm seeing a lot of lines that reference the object.parent = player as a requirement... wondering if removing those lines or perhaps modifying them from player to game.pov instead might fix the issue.\n\nBut ultimately, i'm out of my depth here. If anyone else knows where to begin with this, that'd be great.\n\nEdIt: My gosh, that feels like dodging a bullet! Fingers crossed and knock on wood, but I seem to have fixed it by doing just that. In DoRemove, in the first line (if (not object.parent = player or not object.worn or not object.removeable)), I have replaced player with game.pov. It now looks like this -\nif (not object.parent = game.pov or not object.worn or not object.removeable)\n\nThis has immediately fixed my issue, and now all different playable characters are able to equip and remove clothing and gear as needed. Quite the relief, let me tell you! I will update further if this causes any side effects, though I can't see why it would. You may wish to update the library with this change, unless I've missed something and this is causing serious side effects.",
