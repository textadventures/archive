This is what you load in Quest to run the demo.\nrot.js - The freely available JS library. I did make one minor change to have the DIgger cells reported in row-major order instead of column-major order. Besides that, it's untouched.\nrotglue.js - A small JS glue layer between Quest and rot.js.\n\nThere is one coding ugliness, which is the dependency (for this demo) on a &quot;launch room&quot; that the generated map gets attached to. I found that if the player has already entered a room and a new exit gets added, the map code does not see it, and things get really confused.
