I tried some with umlauts and things, but I haven't found one yet that gets anywhere near the top of the selection box. Part of it might be that the spacing between lines is factored into the overall font height, but then I tried changing the \"line-height\" CSS attribute, it even began clipping into the text, but it never changed the caret height.\r\n\r\nBut everything I've seen googling around looks like the answer is \"no\".\r\n",
