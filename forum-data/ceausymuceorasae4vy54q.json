Does he mean verbs that can be found inside every object? When I go there, all I can do is add new verbs. That's not what I want to do. I want to use the existing words. Does he mean changing verbs that can be found in attributes? Well, that would require you to change the default expression for every object manually, which I know how to do and which is exactly what I am trying to avoid. What I want to do is find that one place where \"That doesn't work\" is written and just change it to something like: \"You could do that, but it wouldn't achieve anything.\", so that this gets applied to every object out there.\r\n\r\nThen he writes: \r\n(replace my 'NAME_OF_OBJECT' with your/the name of the Object of the Verb)\r\n\r\nfor within the GUI/Editor:\r\n```\r\nNAME_OF_OBJECT.defaultexpression => {\r\n  msg (\"You can't do that!

I have already tried to unravel his messages many times before, but each and every time that has just led me down the path of wasting dozens and dozens of hours of trying to figure out what he meant. I am grateful for help, but I really need someone to dumb this down for me a bit.\r\n\r\nAll I want is to find where that part: \"That doesn't work\" is written (it has to exist somewhere) and change it. That's it. This should be pretty simple to do, right?",
