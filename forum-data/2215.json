I prefer the popup windows for system stuff, but its kind of awkward when I have 'What is your name' inline ... but then use the popup menu for the 'gender' choice ... so for right now, I feel like I need to use inline menuing or yes/no prompts ... just for consistency sake.\n\nThe bestter solution would probably be a 'script window' feature ... so a new script function, where it creates a popup window like the help or image window that runs a script ... so we could use it to do a variety of 'windowed' things ... from asking questions to showing inventory to whatever ... but my main interest is just the ability to have a windowed prompt that asks a question and fills out a variable for processing.\n\nThanks for even considering this request.",
