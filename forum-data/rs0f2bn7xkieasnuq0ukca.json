I leave the pane here to draw attention to the painfully obvious things, but any subtle thing in the description of rooms or objects I do not add to the pane.  Crucial things may NOT be visible in the pane.  Crucial verbs are never listed (no verb is ever listed actually).  I do my best to give the player clues and cues to what should or could be done with objects in game.  I really, really try to remove the annoyance of 'guess the right action/verb' (and take pride in doing so) from my games.  In doing so, I think it also makes my writing a little more clever.  A little more 'attended to'.  I just feel like the display verbs take a lot of cleverness and thought away from writing.  Whenever I play a game with these options, I tend not to read or not read as carefully as I should what the author was writing and my experience turns into a clickfest.  Kind of takes away from the game in my opinion.  Needless to say, but I also do not have hyperlinked words anywhere in my games.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of unfolding an object, possibly multiple times, in order to discover some important clue or item.\r\n\r\nJust curious on your thoughts.",

Meant to help me solve problems as I experience them but also, hopefully, a help to others who download/\"play\" the game.  Needs an overhaul with user friendliness.<br>\n<strong>Into the Dragon's Den</strong> - a fun little puzzle game that I wrote in rhyme.  I had fun with this one.<br>\n<strong>Xanadu 1</strong> - My first real lengthy adventure.  A total hack job with code but the result is a pretty clever game.  Might be a bit frustrating because the puzzles are pretty tricky with no REAL in-game help if you get stuck.<br>\n<strong>Xanadu 2</strong> - a colossal adventure with diabolical puzzles and a pretty interesting layout.  Meant to be difficult.  Has a built-in hint system to help eliminate frustrations.  At least get out of the prison cell before getting frustrated.  It is supposed to be linear and confusing at the start as you are trying to get out of \"limbo\".  Solid 10-11 months of developing.</p>\n\n",
