Not 100% sure, but I _think_ you should be able to do something like this instead…\r\n```\r\n<command name=\"lleps\">\r\n  <pattern>lleps #object#;cast lleps at #object#;cast lleps at #object#</pattern>\r\n  <scope>none</scope>\r\n  <changecommandscope type=\"script\">\r\n    foreach (cmd, ScopeCommands()) {\r\n      if (GetBoolean(cmd, \"learnt\")) {\r\n        list add (items, cmd)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  </changecommandscope>\r\n  <script>\r\n    [... as before, except you don't need to compare the parameter to the command names ...]\r\n  </script>\r\n</command>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you get the benefits of it working if you type \"lleps FROTZ\" or whatever; and possibly the disambiguation menu. (I've glanced over the code for ShowMenu, and I don't see anything that would fail if you hand it an objectlist containing commands, turnscripts, or exits. Just as long as every object in the list has a name)\r\n\r\nOn my phone again, haven't actually tested this, but thought I should suggest it.",
