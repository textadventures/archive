So this time, I'm working on a game called Space Travelers. My plan is to make it an Oregon Trail type game in space. Someone's probably done this already, but I'm hoping I can accomplish it.  Unfortunately, I don't think I can accomplish it on the web version, but that doesn't mean I won't try. If anyone's tried something similar, I'd appreciate some tips.",
