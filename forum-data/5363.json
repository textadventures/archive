      "EditableText": "Hello. I'm new in Quest and I am starting by writing a gamebook. It will be a basketball rpg kinda like what nba 2k's my career aims to be, but with much more story development. I know it is a weird idea but i'm just doing it to experiment and learn with it. \n\nMy question is: how do you let the player set his initial stats, in a nice way? Right now i can just ask them &quot;what's your speed stat?&quot; and then set the input as the attribute. But this is kinda sloppy, specially if you want to set various attributes and cap the total attribute points you can spend. \n\nI don't know if it's possible for a gamebook, but I think i've seen a text adventure where it showed you each attribute and then you could manipulate them by clicking a left or right arrow. Anyway, just knowing how to do something like that, even if I can't do it in the gamebook could be useful. Or maybe there are simpler, less fancy ways of doing it in a gamebook.\n\nThanks.\n\n\nedit: I just read about the if answers site. Maybe this should be there.",

I think i'll just stick to a simpler way while I keep learning the basics and advancing with the tutorials. I don't even know how functions work so i don't have any idea how to implement the library to my game. Maybe my idea is better suited for a text adventure. I figured that since I wanted to put a bigger emphasis on storytelling rather than gameplay a gamebook could be preferable. Maybe i'll take a look at that tutorial on making a text adventure with a gamebook style.",
