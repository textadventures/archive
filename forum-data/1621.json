      "EditableText": "I use multiple room descriptions for every room in my game and the following works very well and problem free for me. \r\n\r\n1.) Select run script option when making your room descrption.\r\n\r\n2.) Choose a conditonal (if/then) script option.\r\n\r\n3.) Let's say you are making a room called &quot;Front Porch.&quot;  In the top box of the conditonal select the &quot;if a flag is on&quot; choice.\r\n\r\n4.) Create a flag that is easy to remember.  I always use the name of the room followed by a &quot;d&quot; so in this case the flag would be called &quot;frontporchd&quot;\r\n\r\n5.)  In the &quot;then&quot; box, type a shorter description of the room like a sentance or so.  Something like:\r\n&quot;The front porch remains quiet, almost unaturaly so.  The house is south.&quot;\r\n\r\n6.)  In the else box type the long room description.  In this case we'll type the following:\r\n&quot;The concrete steps outside the house were probably made long before you were a twinke in your father's eyes.  From the front porch you can see the long rows of pine trees that still bring back visions of your childhood.  The door into the house is south.&quot;\r\nAfter you type in the description add a command to turn on the frontporchd flag.\r\n\r\n7.) One last step.  Go to custom commands for the room and make one of the following:\r\n&quot;look;look room;look at room;look at the room;x room;examine room;examine the room&quot;\r\nThen copy and paste your long room description into the &quot;print some text&quot; block on the script.\r\nThis will allow someone to get the long description again at any time by typing look (this overides the natural look that will only give the short description becuase the flag &quot;frontporchd&quot; is on.\r\n\r\nThis has worked great for me.  My game has over 200 rooms and I have yet to encounter a problem doing things this way.  (on a side note, if you need a bunch of crazy stuff happening in a single room there is  a good way to do it.  Make several versions of the room (front porch 1, front porch 2, etc) and give them all the same alias.  You can then give two differant descriptions for each one using flags and make scripts that change the surrounding exits to differant versions of the room.  This will allow you to create some very complicated scenarios using QDK.  Just do not forget to have a script that moves any items the player dropped in front porch 1 to front porch 2 when you change the exits.)\r\n\r\nGood Luck,\r\nDr. Froth",
