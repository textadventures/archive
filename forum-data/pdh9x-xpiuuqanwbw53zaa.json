      "EditableText": "Virtually everything display-related in Quest is done using Javascript. In this case it's fairly simple, as you just want to change the style information of an element.\r\n\r\nThe command you want will be something like:\r\n```\r\nJS.eval(\"$('#endWaitLink').css({color: 'green'});\")\r\n```\r\nThat will change the colour of the \"Continue…\" link to green; and it should stay green whether it's shown or hidden. But it will go back to its default colour when a saved game is reloaded, so I would recommend sending the JS command in your \"UI Initialisation Script\" (which is on the 'Advanced Scripts' tab of the game object, but you might have to enable it by ticking a box on the 'features' tab first). This is just what UI Initialisation is meant for: that script is run before the start script on a new game, and when a saved game is reloaded, so it ensures you will always have the colour you want.",
