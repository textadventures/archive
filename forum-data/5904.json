It seems that I'm cramming in a substantial amount more detail than in most other text adventures, and I'm not bragging about it. I should hope that the quality of my writing is up to scratch, but no matter how good the writing is, what are the inherent risks of excessive descriptive passages? (Maybe mine aren't 'excessive', but they're certainly big).\n\nI'm already aware that I'm certainly straddling the line between interactive fiction and interactive storytelling with my project. It's linear in the regard that the player has a distinct primary objective which serves as an endgame, but as the plans currently stand, there would be three possible, distinct routes which could be taken to reach it, and multiple ways to go about taking them. Puzzles in the conventional sense play a small part in the game experience, which focuses primarily on story-telling, although there would be parts where the player would have to use their head a little. \n\nThe problem is, I can't see the game working in any other way. The environment is exceptionally rich, but I don't want to put people off with walls of text. Part of me thinks that I ought to just write it out in full, then chip away as necessary, rather than start gaffa-taping lines onto it here and there later on should I decide then that I want more.\n\nAs it stands, the description for the first room, and the sizeable in-room description of the sole major object within it at the moment, not including a one-off message displayed at the start of the game describing the unique state of an object within it, is 302 words long, and just under 1800 characters. Too much?",
