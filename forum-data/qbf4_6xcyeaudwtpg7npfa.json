I think you want something like this:\r\n\r\n    msg (\"Enter your name:\")\r\n    GetInput() {\r\n      player.alias = result\r\n      msg (\"You are \" + player.alias)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nGetInput, ShowMenu and Ask all store the answer in a variable called ```result```, which is available within the curly braces. Also be aware that control flow splits here, and only the block within the curly braces is waiting for player input, not the code after that. There are workarounds for that, but first get familiar with this stuff before you look into that.\r\n\r\nWhen in a gamebook you need the page to be either script or script + text. If it is script only you need to set up the page links differently or move the player to a different page within the script.\r\n\r\nIn general, following the tutorial and trying to convert an existing gamebook (pdf) to Quest was a big help in learning this system. Just keep in mind that if you use existing gamebooks as template there is most likely a copyright, so you are not allowed to share your work on it. It is just for your personal training purposes. So just look through it and pick some pages that include some \"mechanics\" that need some work.",
