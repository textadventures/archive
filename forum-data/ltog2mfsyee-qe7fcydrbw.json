I've been looking on the forums and I've seen this discussed a few times but-- does anyone know of a good tutorial on programming more dynamic conversations? \r\n\r\nlike for example you talk to a character and a menu pops up with:\r\n\r\nWhat would you like to ask?\r\n- Example one\r\n- Example two\r\n- Example three\r\n\r\nand then it would branch off from that point. Basically the way your conversation goes would be set in stone (think of like a dragon age game where what you say effects your relationship and you cant really go back on it) \r\n\r\nwould something like that be possible without being too clunky? As it stands I have sort of an idea of how to do it but I'm not certain. Any help would be appreciated, sorry that I'm asking so many questions on here! \r\n\r\n(also for context im doing a text adventure game where you're stuck inside on a rainy day and exploring the house and stuff inside of it, then an event triggers where your romantic interest comes over.)",
