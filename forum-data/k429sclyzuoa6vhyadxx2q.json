I only said \"Henry is not here\". You were supposed to assume that you were looking for Henry. If you look in shoe before finding Henry, after, and at home you get progressively more info, butI have deliberately given no clue to do that unless you are replaying it.  I fixed door 301 and capitals. Thanks for that. (I changed room numbers to make it higher floor. I missed a reference. Your feedback much appreciated.",

Apart from the rooms that can’t be entered the secondary cereal bar theme would be better if integrated with the main mystery. I have found a few more glitches but announcing them in the forum might be too much of a spoiler? Two I can mention are (i) try looking at door 302; (ii) use ‘look’ in the final home location.",
