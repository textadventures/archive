I tried to use a string list in an attribute on an object but couldn't code it, so the list of objects and where they should be moved to would be executed. Then I thought I using an object list but I couldn't figure that out either. And it would really only be good to move objects on mass to the same location.\r\nHow do I do this?",

Why not just make a script that moves all the objects to where you want them?\r\n\r\nIf you want to code both the object and its destination, it makes more sense to use a dictionary. So, here's a sample function `MoveObjects` which has a single parameter, `dict`.\r\n```\r\nforeach (key, dict) {\r\n  obj = GetObject (key)\r\n  if (not obj = null) {\r\n    destination = DictionaryItem (dict, key)\r\n    if (TypeOf (destination) = \"string\") destination = GetObject (destination)\r\n    if (not destination = null) {\r\n      obj.parent = destination\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could call this something like:\r\n```\r\nstuff_to_move = NewDictionary()\r\ndictionary add (stuff_to_move, \"bell\", church)\r\ndictionary add (stuff_to_move, \"book\", library)\r\ndictionary add (stuff_to_move, \"candle\", pantry)\r\nMoveObjects (stuff_to_move)\r\n```\r\nOf course, this is more code than just moving the objects directly. But you could use an attribute instead of the local variable `stuff_to_move`, so you can make the dictionary at one point and then move all the objects later.\r\n\r\nYou could also use it with the QuickParams function, but this is limited (I can't remember if it's a maximum of 3 or 4 dictionary items this way):\r\n```\r\nMoveObjects (QuickParams (\"object1\", \"room1\", \"object2\", \"room2\", \"object3\", \"room3\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in this example, the rooms can be given either as a room object, or a string containing the exact name of the room.
