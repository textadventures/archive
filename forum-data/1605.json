I pressed OK and the box disappeared, and QDK didn't shut down.  Now QDK didn't hide my task bar.  As a test, I pressed max-button again (as in double-box mode) and my task bar was hidden again, but no &quot;error 384&quot; pop-up box appeared.

Also, I've noticed that you've eliminated the About link and swapped it for the Quest logo.  Although that'd a neat idea, it'll be harder for people to discover, and I don't think you should be put in the background, Alex.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of backgrounds: I've noticed that the Help menu's background-color can be altered, and I thank you for that. :}",
