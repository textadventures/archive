Create the room using the name in the string variable,\n3. Create exits using the name in the string variable,\n\nI've tried a really simple attempt (see attached) but it fails with Error 9 - Subscript out of range in RoomExits.addFromTag.\n\nI would welcome any advice or help!\n\nThanks, Verbojuce",
