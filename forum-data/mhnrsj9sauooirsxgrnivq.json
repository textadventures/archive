So you have game 1 and game 2. presumably it would be cool to have a storage place, Lets say.. a \"File\" we will call \"Game Progress.\" that you could store thngs in, that both game 1 and then laer game 2,3,4,5 can all access the vars so as you write the \"modules\" your have the same character in the series. Something like that. \r\n\r\nNow if you can declare a \"global\" so like @set g_charstr  (using the naming convention) or @setGlobal \"<game><charname>\" Strength. So several games can share storage. \r\n ",
