      "EditableText": "Since I found more time, I'll explain more about the Living Nightmare.\n\nI loved playing the old click and point games when I was a kid. Even though Quest is not a click and point game maker. I decided since the text adventure is similar to how a click and point game works. That's exactly what I'm aiming for.\n\nSince this is my first text adventure game and working on it being a long game that might take the player two weeks or more to finish. I sat down and thought about how other games gave a challenge and or stretched their game to being a longer game to finish.\n\nI finally realized that, Even with a good story and a lot of dialog. Puzzles is the key to creating more time within any game.\n\nI came up with an idea, Thanks to my old favourite game Diablo. Since in Diablo the maps are always different when ever you started a new game.\nSome key items within my puzzles, Will not always be found in the same place. Though there will be hints given out to the player by talking to other characters and or the old method of trial and error to finding the key item(s) for that puzzle.\n\nI would love telling everyone more about the story but I really dislike spoilers and I'm sure some may feel the same way. Though what I will say and it will be referring to my first post here. \n\nWhat touchy subject have I chosen?\n\nWell since it happens a lot in my country, I decided to try build an awareness towards child abuse, rape and things a long those lines. It's sad that things like this happens in the world but all we can do is try and support the victims by teaching others that this is wrong. This is also why I am putting this game in the horror genre, Since putting it in comedy or any other genre would not be very appropriate, Well in my point of view.\n\nIf anyone has any questions or like to give ideas towards other puzzles or anything else. Please feel free to post here.\n\nI hope some of you are looking forward to playing the Living Nightmare when it is ready to be released.",

      "EditableText": "I finally started working on other rooms and other characters while also still busy with the Pharmacy. I kinda had another idea and gave myself extra work for the Pharmacy lol. I realized once the medicine is used, There wouldn't be away to get it back. So I thought up a solution for the player to work out on how to get the medicine refilled. This also would work well since if the player used up the main ingredients for a recipe, They would need away to get the medicine back. So that's going to take time to put in.\n\nI've also started working on a Game Manual for the game and when it's ready, It will be in PDF format and I'll post it here or on my friend's website. Since I'm going to be posting my game here and there. The only reason why I'm making a Game Manual is because new people that have no knowledge of text adventure games, Would never realise to type &quot;help&quot;, So I'm solving that issue by doing this.\n\nI also had a little problem with my Mall Announcements that I didn't notice before but I fixed that now. Seems I'm the only one using timers in a completely different way lol. If it works, I'm happy.\n\nPlus most of the conversations in this game are only run by timers and I'm happy with that.\n\nI'm quite shocked to how much I've done so far since I took a three day break from this project. When I finally had a clear mind, I was able to do a lot more than I did before. Also during that three day break, I came up with three other puzzle ideas and already put in one of them and will soon add the other two. Just wish there was a quicker way to spot an error than to always testing the game.\n\nI've also by luck came up with four other game story ideas for other games that I hope I will work on when this project is finished. Not to mention also helping my friend by testing his games and helping him with game descriptions for his games lol. Since one day we want to work and make other games together. Basically he wants to use my stories for his games and it's my job to come up with every little detail for the story, characters and dialog.\n\nAnyway until my next update. Cheers all.",
