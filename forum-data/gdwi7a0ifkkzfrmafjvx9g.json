It appears on the right, where all objects are listed but if player doesn't look there he won't know about it. Therefore I want the list of objects (that appear when entering the room) was printed again, including the new object.\r\nThanks in advance!",

I want for a player to know that there is a new object to interact with. I want that mostly because when I showed my friends my previous short game they were so into it that they even didn't notice the menu on the right. Just want to make sure no one will stuck just because an object didn't appear where the game takes place.\r\nI hope what I say is understandable ;)\r\nThanks",
