I'm very eager to be able to produce exe files of the games I make in Quest, so the first thing I did, after downloading, was test the packager and the compiler on one of the example games. Unfortunately, both seem to very quickly crash. The bar goes about a quarter of the way and then the programme stops responding. Is this perhaps some in-built copy protection on the example games? I've just been trying it on 'Assassin'.\n\nI'm using Windows 7 and I believe I downloaded version 4.1.5.\n\nThanks a bunch if you can help!\n\nJon",
