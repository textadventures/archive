You can use QDK for non-script like interface (ie for beginners) but jumping into ASL shouldn't be hard for some-one with previous programming skills. I rocommend making a few games in QDK then looking at the code through say notepad first to see what the code looks like and what it does, as it's a bit different from the kind of code you've posted. Roms aren't done by locations though, but with nifty arrays you can randomly pick them.... t'd take a bit of codnig though. lol. If you nood any help come to me or tron, as he's best generally, I'm second best generally and best with multiplayer.  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /><!-- s:wink: -->",

You are a bunch of really nice people to be associated with.  I will have questions, My problem now is I don't know what I am talking about yet. in a couple of days the Questions will start. I work 11 hour Graveyard shift, and have little time to do anything. so I lose sleep to program :')",
