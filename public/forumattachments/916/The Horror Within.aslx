The tall man behind you is holding a bloody axe above his head ready to drop it on your already wounded body. Yet, even though you managed to catch only a glimpse of him, the image was horrifying. His face is hidden behind a dirty triangular hood and his slender muscles are covered in sweat and blood behind a transparant plastic butcher's outfit. It is an image you quickly wish to forget.</look>
