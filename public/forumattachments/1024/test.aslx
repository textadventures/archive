      <description>From here it sppears you can go anywhere in the house.  The most obvious feature is the staircase that goes upstairs.  Down the hallway in front of you and past the stairs seems another door that leads outside.  To the east seems to be some sort of bar room while to the west there are multiple many chairs that are covered in dirty sheets.</description>

      <description>To the north lies the {object:rundown house} that your friend said he would meet you at.  Like the house, the yard is in equal disrepair; the grass is untamed and left to grow as it wills and there is no visible pathway to speak of, though the grass is a couple feet shorter in a line from the road making it a bit easier to traverse.</description>

        msg ("The road from Mistakonic University was slightly longer than you had anticipated as can be easily seen by the blood orange rays clinging to the hills in the west.  The setting sun leaves you on the doorstep of a rather old and neglected house in the middle of the New England countryside.  There is nothing else around you for miles, save for the dirt-packed road that leads through the thick woods and back the way you just came.  The cold had come early this year and as you stuff your hands in your coat pocket you happen to feel something touch your right fingers.  A letter from an old colleague that asked you to come to this forsaken property.  Hopefully he has already arrived, but the place seems deserted.  The wind picks up slightly as you look at the house, causing you to pull your coat closer to your body.<br/>")

        <look>The house is old and looks like it hasn't been lived in for many years.  The style seems to have echoes of early 19th century rural design but the house has seen many additions over the years so it's hard to tell exactly how old it is.  The wood construction has varying levels of quality depensing on where you look and along the roof you can barely make out the top of a stone chimney.</look>

      <description>You're in what appears to be a bedroom, though it seems so ill-cared for that it is doubtful that anyone actually lives here.  Aged and rotting furniture dot the room, which includes a bed, a dress and a nightstand.  The rug in front of the bed looks to have been chewed on by something over a long period of time.  Everything has a thick layer of dust that makes it seem as if the room has not been used in a great many years. </description>

The shelves lining the walls have various boxes, sacks and tins of different foods...well...at one point they were probably food.
