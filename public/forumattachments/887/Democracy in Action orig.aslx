    <description><![CDATA[Yesterday, a woman dressed in black cloaks and veils appeared in your village and invited you to take part in special training for the best rogues, mages, and fighters in Cognosco. You were shocked to receive her invitation, but you quickly accepted. Now you are standing in a huge room. You don't know how you got here, but it's easily the most impressive place you've ever seen.<br/><br/>Rich velvet banners hang from the wall. Marble pillars bracket you on either side. There are a few people in the room -- a mage and a fighter talking quietly in a corner, and a rogue sharpening a dagger while he chuckles to himself. There is one exit, a huge white gateway. The woman in the black cloak stands in front of it.]]></description>

There is a black iron throne in the middle of the room, surrounded by some dark liquid that you don't want to touch. The entire room seems to have been carved out of a gleaming black material. The only light comes from a globe hanging in the middle of the room. It shines a beam of welcome warmth over you and when you step into the beam, you smell the rich scents of home: meadows, baking bread, fresh fallen rain. <br/><br/>The throne seems to cast too many shadows. You remember that Ignarus is a dictatorship under the rule of King Nocens, and that this means he is the ultimate authority in that dark kingdom. He is the only one who makes decisions, and his word is law. You shudder, grateful that Cognosco allows its citizens so much freedom and participation in government.<br/><br/>To the northeast, a massive iron gate stands closed.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[You are in what looks like, but cannot possibly be, the throne room of the kingdom of Cognosco. A large white throne dominates the room where the king would usually sit. However, you recall that in the year 1215, King John signed the <i> Magna Carta, </i> or Great Charter, transforming Cognosco into a <i> constitutional monarchy </i> -- a democracy, where the power lies in the hands of the people.<br/><br/>That means that in Cognosco, even though the king is the head of the government, the people are the ones truly in charge. In front of King Ion's throne sits a round table with space for twelve representatives, elected from the provinces of Cognosco. You excitedly find the chair labeled <i> Praesto, </i>, the name of your home province. You know that a local shopkeeper named Minerva was elected to this position. She is your province's voice in the government.<br/><br/>Aside from the gleaming white throne and the round table, the walls are white marble. The crest of Cognosco hangs behind the throne. Two smaller thrones sit to the side. Princess Lenis often occupies the one on the right. Before her death, the Queen Mother sat in the one to the left. A large white gate leads to the north. ]]></description>

Although... when you remember some of the "tricks" mages have performed in your village, you have to wonder. Are you sure you chose the right class?<br/><br/>The only thing in the room -- aside from a whole lot of green -- is a pedestal in its center. The pedestal also seems like it was carved from marble. You approach and see that there is a clear glass lid covering a piece of paper. The glass lid has a circular space that looks like you can press something into it.]]></description>
