<!--

A very simple module that lets you easily put a shop into the game.
To use:
1. Have a Boolean attribute on your shop called "shop" set to true.
2. Have an integer attrubute on the player called "money", set to the
   amount of cash the player starts with. It would be good to set this
   as a status attribute too.
3. Any goods for sale should be placed in the shop. Set to scenery and
   not takeable (these will be changed when the item is purchased).
   They also need an integer attribute "price"; this will be deducted
   from the player's money.

Feel free to modify this code as you wish.
