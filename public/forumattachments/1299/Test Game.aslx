    <description><![CDATA[It's Autumn in the year 1234 SC here in the south of Reres. The Rerisian weather, as usual, is cold and unforgiving though you're long used to it by now. A small fire crackling in the hearth of your family's shared bedroom dispells some of the chill, but not all whilst you wash and dress for the day.<br/><br/>Today is your sixteenth birthday, and you're dressing up in your finest to attend the celebration. Clothing had been left out for you for the occasion, but you're alone now to spend the last few minutes of your childhood in contemplation. <br/><br/>After today, your family's first priority will be to secure a marriage alliance for you. There have been talks practically from birth about your marriage, and that of your younger sister, but thus far you've escaped any bethrothals.  <br/><br/>Looking into your mother's most prized possession, a polished metal mirror the size of a plate, you see...]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[And an attractive one at that. Nature has been kind to you in a way that it hasn't to others. Regardless, the mirror reflects you standing in the outfit selected for you earlier in the day.<br/><br/>It is quite traditional, though of high quality.  Your léine, dyed red, falls long, almost to the floor, covered by a fine airisaidh worn over the shoulders. A circular iron brooch fastens the plaid at the breast and a leather belt secures it to your waist. Your long hair falls down your back, unbound as you're not yet married.]]></description>

Regardless, the mirror reflects you standing in the outfit selected for you earlier in the day.<br/><br/>It is quite traditional, though of high quality.  Your léine, dyed yellow, falls to your thighs, further kept warm this time of year by trews. A fine plaid covers your shoulders, secured at the waist with a leather belt. Your long hair flows down your back, combed into neatness. ]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[{if player.sex = female: Female!}<br/><br/>Upon arrival at your celebration, the first thing everyone notices is your outfit. Several eyes feel heavy and full of disapproval upon you, whispers strike up as you as you pass.  <br/><br/>Ianka, the eldest daughter of your neighboring clan, turns from the rest of your childhood friends as you approach and gives you a delighted, devilish smile, "Well look at you. I never would have thought you'd dress so scandalously, but I guess I was wrong. Oh dear, here comes your father..."<br/><br/>You only just digest the fact that Ianka's wearing the headdress of a married woman herself when you spot the aforementioned father making his way towards you through the crowd, a scowl on his face...]]></description>
