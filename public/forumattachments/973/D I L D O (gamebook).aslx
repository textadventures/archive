    <description><![CDATA[<b><i><u>“THE TIME…DRAWS…NEAR…”</u></i></b><br/>-<br/><b><i>“Turn, turn, clock of despair…”<br/>“Bring back the heart of my hate…”<br/>“Travel, travel, remnants of the past…”<br/>“Never cease on the path against fate…”<br/>“Trickle, trickle, sands of time…”<br/>“Count down the end of all things…”<br/>“Live on; live on, soul chosen by gods…”<br/>“Against Dangers in Lands Deemed Obscene.”</i></b><br/><i>“Now, would you kindly wake up?  I’d rather not do this all over again…”</i><br/>-<br/>A sudden shock wracks your system, and your eyes fly open, panic taking a firm hold in your chest as you suddenly feel like you’ve woken up in a very strange place.   The moment passes, and as you look about the building, you realize that you’re actually at home, and what you had was just some kind of panic attack.<br/><br/>You sit up in your bed, pulling the covers away and taking a moment to breathe deeply before looking out the window.<br/><br/>For as long as you can remember, you’ve lived within this town, Laveran, and grown up in a peaceful existence.  You’ve worked hard, followed the law, admittedly fucked (up) here or there but so does everyone.  However all in all you’ve lived a life you wouldn’t trade for anything.<br/><br/>Slowly, you take a moment to stretch and enjoy the morning, as it seems to be yet another start to yet another great day.  You can smell fresh bread set out on the bedside table, the sunlight pouring through the window makes everything seem bright and cheery, and it looks as if you’ll have plenty of good things to do today.<br/><br/>A knock at the door disturbs you from your happy little stupor, and as you go to answer it, you already know who it is.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>(I’m no great shakes at programming.  If I can find someone who knows it better than me I can start putting in some decision making stuff.  But for right now, I’m sorry, you’ll have to go with choose your own adventure stuff with some small actions here or there.  At least for now.)<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>The door swings open, and not a moment after that a yellow furry mass wraps itself around your midsection and nearly throws you off of your feet.  You manage to somehow catch yourself, however, and the sound of a contended purr reaches your ear.  A cold, small wet sensation also digs under your chin, and it seems whoever it is happens to be very friendly.<br/><br/>Although you already know exactly who it is.  And you have no problems with them being friendly.<br/><br/>To be honest, your relationship with her is a bit…complicated, and you remind her of this fact with a gentle tug on her iron collar.  Though it’s not something she wants to do, or you’re really psyched about yourself, she slowly lets you go.  You do give her a quick rub on the belly to show there’re no hard feelings, which she tries to resist the urge to scrunch her shoulders at in pleasure.<br/><br/>You smile.  Sometimes it’s easy to please girls like her.<br/><br/>Then her pointed ears flicker and she ducks inside, doing her best to seem busy.  Her rough, dirty rags that were a poor excuse for ‘clothing’ did help her blend in, but made you feel guilty.  One day, you remind yourself, one day.<br/><br/>Then you look to your left.  And you see exactly why she ducked inside.<br/><br/>A huge man with four arms was headed in your direction, and the fact he had brown instead of pale skin under the thick set of armor didn’t make you feel any more confident in the situation.  Nor the upset expression on his face.<br/><br/>Shit. <br/><br/>Then you brush off your trousers; try to get any wrinkles out of your shirt, and just in general try to look more intimidating.  <br/>Maybe you can just get him to mind his own business.<br/><br/>You look back over at him.<br/><br/>He brought friends.<br/><br/>Fuck.<br/><br/>You look up to the sky and exhale, well, so much for a good morning.<br/><br/>And all of a sudden…<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<b><i><u>“HEAR ME UNFAITHFUL.  THY TIME HAS COME.  THY PLIGHT HAS RISEN TO TAKE THEE AND PURIFY THIS TAINTED LAND.  LET JUDGEMENT BE DONE.”</u></i></b><br/><br/><i>BONG</i><br/><br/>A loud, massive noise rang out throughout the whole place.  No, that didn’t quite exactly describe it.  It rang through EVERYTHING.<br/><br/><i>BONG</i><br/><br/>The earth beneath your feet shook with great, terrible force, nearly throwing you again, if it wasn’t for your cat lover and servant running up behind to catch you.<br/><br/>The brown, four armed man looked over and saw the two of you together, and raised a hand as if to say ‘I knew it!’ only to then be smashed by a giant flying stone.<br/><br/>The ground started to crack with the force of a thousand smith’s hammers.   The buildings around you suddenly were catching fire, smoke climbed to the sky like the flight of millions of crows.  The world still shook, but you feel something tugging on your left arm and find a friendly yellow hand-paw trying to lead you away.<br/><br/><i>BONG</i><br/><br/><b><i>Turn, turn, clock of despair…<br/>Bring back the heart of my hate…</i></b><br/><br/>She pulls you through the maddening streets as the chaos slowly grows around you.  Now people seem to be going insane.  For a moment, you think you have a goblin pulling you by the hand, and almost pull away in sheer fright, but something tells you to keep hold, and the vision passes, her normal lithe stature taking shape outside of the next smoke cloud, which forces you to cough as you inhale it.<br/><br/>Then the hackles along the back of your neck suddenly raise eerily, a cold sensation dripping along your spine that makes you pull her to your chest and duck down behind an overturned cart.  Not a moment too soon, as a glass vial flies overhead, and a moment later, the roar of an explosion brings the world mute.<br/><br/>Dear Dei, they’re throwing firebombs.<br/><br/>You can’t hear a thing.  You can smell the acrid, painful scent of smoke in the air and the sudden metallic taste of blood fills you mouth.  Your eyes take in the insanity unfolding around you.<br/><br/>Then you feel a tug on your shirt and see her pulling you onward again.  Why move?  Things are just so insane, there’s no point.  We’re all going to die.  We’re all already dead.<br/><br/>The ground is still shaking.  It is shaking and the world is on fire.  Everyone is running everywhere but no one is getting anywhere.  So what’s the point in running anywhere?<br/><br/>She pulls on your arm again, and you feel your foot shift forward.  You look her in the eye.  There’s a tear in there.  A single, crystal tear.  She is not letting you go.  Not without a fight.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>How dare you do anything less for her?<br/><br/><i>BONG</i><br/><br/><b><i>Travel, travel, remnants of the past…<br/>Never cease on the path against fate…</i></b><br/><br/>You shake your head clear of these dark thoughts.  What were you thinking about?  We need to get moving?  Your legs feel a bit like lead, but you manage to keep putting them one in front of the other.<br/><br/>Your hearing is starting to come back now…and you wish it wasn’t.  There’s an awful lot of screaming now.  Screaming and crying.  And exploding, we can’t forget the explode-<br/><br/>You hear something…something big…and coming from-<br/><br/>You pull her out of the way and manage to turn around just as the figure from before, the four armed man, stabs you in the shoulder with a knife, pinning you to the ground and grinning maniacally over you, bloodied to a pulp, cuts all over his face and arms.<br/><br/>“At last I have you!  I’ve known for the longest time you’ve been far too kind with that little bitch over there.  But now I have you where I want you, you can <i>SAY GOODBYE TO THAT WHORE!</i>”<br/><br/><i>BONG</i><br/><br/><b><i>Trickle, trickle, sands of time…<br/>Count down to the end of all things…<br/></i></b><br/>Then he sudden got thrown sideways by something fast and yellow and-<br/><br/>“YOU!”<br/><br/>The four armed man smacked her across the face, and she crashed to the ground, a gash across her head, blood leaking onto the ground.<br/><br/>“I’ll deal with you later…bitch.”<br/><br/>He spat on her face…and without a second thought, you launched yourself at him.  A stray sword crossed your path as you charged, and you yanked it out of the body it protruded from, lopping off the bastards head with a single mighty swing, cutting straight through his chain-mail with berserker-rage and a serrated blade.<br/><br/>The four armed man didn’t even have time to open his mouth in shock before it hit the dirt, his body slumped over.  Then you looked at the sword, threw it aside, and pulled her body over your shoulder, carrying her on your back, looking for somewhere you can hide out and be safe.  Somewhere that you can wait this all out.<br/><br/><i>BONG</i><br/><br/><b><i>Live on; live on, soul chosen by gods…<br/>Against Dangers in Lands Deemed Obscene…<br/></i></b><br/>She seemed to be getting heavier with every step forward, and the sounds of the insanity of the town were drawing closer.  You had to get away, you had to, and you <i>had to now</i>!<br/><br/><i>There!</i><br/><br/>A little distances away, a cave.  It looked like the entrance was covered over by a large stone partway, but with a little, okay, a lot of shoving, the stone gave way and the cave opened itself to you.  Without pause, you dragged the both of you inside and covered the entrance with some of the twigs and leaves.   There was no way you’d be able to move the boulder from the inside, at least in your current condition.<br/><br/>Then, slowly, you leaned back, and didn’t even realize that you’d turned her stomach into a pillow.  Because the moment you felt something soft under your head, you passed out from sheer exhaustion…<br/><br/><b><i><u>“IT. IS…NOT DONE.  THIS LAND IS STILL OBSCENE.”<br/></u></i></b>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[…<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>(Hours later)<br/><br/>A groan escapes your lips as you slowly arouse yourself from your slumber.  Then you crack your neck, and just as you look left…<br/><br/>Oh.<br/><br/>She’s just lying there…asleep, and her head is still bleeding a bit.  It doesn’t look too bad, but you take the time to rip cloth from your destroyed shirt, clean up her wound as best you can with the not-supplies you have around you (thankfully there’s a pool of crystal clean water in the cave) and wrapping it up as best you can.  It’s a slip-shod job, medicine is her strong suit, not yours, but it should keep her in good condition for now.<br/><br/>You step around her swishing tail and make for the mouth of the cave.  It’s very likely you aren’t the only one who needs this space, and perhaps there’s someone else who could use it.<br/><br/>That is…if anyone is left.<br/><br/>You immediately push the thought aside.  There are bound to be survivors.  The two of you made it, so why couldn’t anyone else?  In fact, it’s still probably a complete and utter mad-<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>It’s…quiet…<br/><br/>That in itself brings a chill to your spine.  There should be some kind of noise out there.  The earth shaking, that odd voice saying…something, people screaming, fire burning, just something.<br/><br/>Instead, there is nothing.  It is pure, unbroken silence that reaches your ears through the barrier of plants and sticks covering the cave entrance.  The kind of silence that only permeated graves and places of the dead.  It crept into the bones and spoke of all sorts of unnaturalness.<br/><br/>It was so quiet…that…<br/><br/>You break through the covering to the world outside, and right away regret your actions.<br/><br/>The world is as ashes.<br/><br/>It is as ashes and blood and sorrow and death.<br/><br/>As far as you can see, there are ruins.  The ground is cracked and jagged, even shifted toward the sky in some places, like a maw of the earth trying to swallow away the broken land.  Bloody, burned, and brutal corpses are scattered like so many stones, left hither and thither in a careless, loveless fashion.  As you walk through the town, you see that not even the smallest animals were able to escape this…this…whatever this was.  In one corner, which you try not to get a better view of, it looked like someone was getting eaten.<br/><br/>You hope that it was a trick of some sort.<br/><br/>The air is thick with smoke and ashes, and it makes breathing seem a little difficult.  You take a seat near the cave, and just allow your will to crumble.<br/><br/>Why did this happen?<br/><br/>Why did this <i>happen</i>?<br/><br/>“Well, it looks like this place has gone to hell in a hand basket.”<br/><br/>You look up, and see a man casually strolling through the wreckage.  He’s dressed oddly to boot.  He’s got this dark blue vest on, but it doesn’t look like it would make very good armor, and it’s over a pure white shirt.  As he walks toward you, a hand reaches up to adjust something secured around his neck, nearly the same color as the vest.  His pants are a gray tone, long, and have some sort of folding lines pressed into them.  Atop his head was some kind of black hat with a white feather sticking out of it.  However, the oddest thing, besides a loop of gold chain casually swinging from the side of his pants, was his shoes.  They had two colors.  The back and toe were black, but the middle part was pure white, and they didn’t look like any shoes you’d seen before.<br/><br/>The odd man walked toward you, and twirled a long staff in his other hand.  The staff itself seemed to be made of a long, thin hourglass and topped with a glass ball no wider than the staff was thick.  But even the staff seemed to be strange, as the sand was apparently falling down the hourglass without end, and continued to fall in the same direction no matter what angle it was held at, with the sand descending from under the glass ball all the way to the bottom, and never filling it.<br/><br/>The figure catches your eye, and you realize why he has a staff.<br/><br/>His eyes are completely white.  Not even the merest hint of a pupil or iris.  It was so strange.<br/><br/>“Like what you see?”<br/><br/>You suddenly blink, realizing that you were staring at him.  Hey, wait…can he actually see you?<br/><br/>“I can do a bit more than that.”<br/><br/>You jump to your feet, and angle yourself away from this odd man.  Whatever he is, he feels dangerous, it seems like he read your thoughts, and the more you think about it, the more it seems likely, and the less you like it.<br/><br/>Then he looks right past you and at something behind your right shoulder.<br/><br/>“Up and about now, are we?”<br/><br/>Up and…oh!<br/><br/>Your guess was correct.  Drowsily, she climbs her way out of the cave and rubs the lingering tiredness from her eyes.  By the time you get to her side, however, she’s already seen what happened to your home, and it shocks her to the core.<br/><br/>“By…the demi-gods…”<br/><br/>You sit her down on the rock you were using just moments ago, and try to keep her from freaking out, but it looks more like she lost…well, everything.<br/><br/>“Ooh…that’s one sexy cat you have there.  Hey kitty-kitty, why don’t you come play with me?”<br/><br/>Your death glare doesn’t deter the man in the slightest, but he winks at you, as if he suddenly gets an understanding, “I see, already got a partner, do you?  Shame…the good ones are always the first to go.”<br/><br/>Then he laughs at his own joke, slapping his knee as if it was the funniest thing in the world, and for a moment, you wonder if there’s a spare stone lying around to bean him upside the head with, until she raises her head and takes note of the strange guest for the first time.<br/><br/>“Who…are you?”<br/><br/>He blinks, as if someone just told him that his ears were kumquats, and then took the strange hat off of his head, placed it in front of his chest with a flourish, and bowed.<br/><br/>“Ah, do forgive me, darlin’.  How rude to not properly introduce myself.  Though, to be fair, how DO I go about introducing myself?”<br/><br/>What?  Just what was this fool going on about?  He tapped his foot on the ground, scratching his chin after putting the hat back on his head.<br/><br/>“Well, there are a number of names I go by.  Too many to go over right now, so I guess I’ll just have to pick the one most relevant.  I am Tickaera, essential fragment of Dei, demi-god and the Lord of Time, at your service.”<br/><br/>A demi-god!?  Here!?  What would one of the worldly lords be doing here?  Unless…<br/><br/>You ask him why he’s here, and he smiles at you, before taking a seat on thin air.  Yup.  Demi-god.<br/><br/>“Well that’s one hell of a way to thank me for saving your asses!  Though to be fair you had a good hand in it yourselves, I half expected that brutish Kael’e to gut you then and there with that knife were it not for your lovely little friend over there.”<br/><br/>He waggles his eyebrows, and you feel her grip you more tightly.  This seems to make him sigh in response, “All the time in the world and no one to spend it with.  Tch, such a shame.”<br/><br/>He saved us, how?<br/><br/>“Well I can’t exactly go out and tell you right away, can I?  I’ve got to have some fun SOME how.  Although I can see you are confused and getting a wee bit angry at me, so for the sake of avoiding pointless confrontation, it’s time for a little exposition!”<br/><br/>“But first…”<br/><br/><i>TINK<br/><br/>TINK<br/><br/>TINK<br/></i><br/>“Oi!  You there!  Yes, you at the screen!  You reading this carefully?!  Because I’m only going to tell you this once, so PAY ATTENTION.  This is IMPORTANT SHIT.”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>You have no idea what in Crypt he’s doing.<br/><br/>Then the demi-god clears his throat and leans forward on his staff, looking you in the eyes.<br/><br/>“Well, how I saved you both is not really the important part, though I will say it did involve a bit of cleverness of my own, if I may be so bold.  The important part is that right now you and I have a common goal.”<br/><br/>A common goal?  What could that be?<br/><br/>“You’re dicking with me, right?  No, no you’re not, because if you were there’d be a lot more booze, girls, and boom chicka boom to go around.  Damn.  Although I do admit I’m surprised at you.  I’d figure that someone like yourself would WANT to go after the asshole that wrecked your hometown.  At least, that’s what I’d be after in your position.”<br/><br/>You feel angry at him suddenly; your loss, your sadness, your fury at what happened boiling in your veins.  How does he know that ISN’T what you want?  How DARE he presume otherwise!  Where does he get off even SUGGESTING something like that!  Who does he think he IS!?<br/><br/>You want to hurt him, to make him suffer for accusing you of such things.  But as you try to step forward, you feel a tug on your arm and look down to see her shaking her head.  She’s scared, if the slight shaking she’s making is any indication.  Tickaera, however, simply grins at you slyly.<br/><br/>“So that is what you want after all.  Vengeance.  Payback.  An evening of the scales.  Then we do indeed have a common goal, my companions.  You want to destroy the thing that brought you such sorrow, the ‘Plight’ as we can call it.  Well it just so happens that I want it taken down as well.  That thing is not very conducive for the acquisition of Heaven in my books, but I have a small problem.”<br/><br/>He looks down and what little carefree attitude was in his stance vanishes, his two-colored shoes no longer tapping on the ground every so often.<br/><br/>“I do not know much about that mysterious phenomenon we’re calling the Plight.  But I do know whatever it is; it has an awful lot of power behind it.  An awful lot of unusual power.  So, in order to bring an end to it, I intend to enlist your help.  If you truly want to defeat this monstrosity, you’ll take whatever help I can provide.”<br/><br/>He extends his hand toward you; smiling again, his…‘joyful’ air returning and you look at his hand, unsure of what to do.  When you look in her eyes, the fact she distrusts him is very clear.  However, he’s made a good point, even if it’s roundabout.  You need help to find it, this ‘Plight’, and kill it dead.  Without allies at hand, you have no chance.<br/>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[You take his hand, and he shakes it once.<br/><br/>“Excellent!  Now, first thing’s first.”<br/><br/>He snapped his fingers, and then there was a deafening crack of thunder, so loud you had to cover your ears and turn away.  When the echoes of the crack of thunder subside, you look back and see a pale white structure beside him, a square pillar taller than yourself, topped with a triangular head, and inscribed with glowing words that seemed to hum quietly with power.<br/><br/>Tickaera taps the structure with the ball end of his staff.<br/><br/>“See, I’ll be lending a sort of backseat supporting role in your quest.  The reasons being a bit too complicated to get into at present time.  So for now, I give you this.”<br/><br/>You look at the writing, its yellow glow a little difficult to see past, and for a moment, you wish you could understand what was on the object.<br/><br/>The thought doesn’t even pass through your head before the inscriptions darken and transform before your eyes, and they become a series of numbers, the top most unchanging, with the numbers near the bottom flickering by faster than you can see.  It looks like some kind of…counter.<br/><br/>“That’s EXACTLY what it is, friend!  This little beauty here is a clock that counts down to the Plight’s return.  As for how I know that and when, well I AM the Lord of Time.  I know a few things.  But, point being, when the numbers on this thing all hit zero…well that means its show time pal ‘o’ mine!”<br/><br/>Show time…so when that thing hits zero…<br/><br/>Then she speaks up.<br/><br/>“Now hold on, why are you doing this?  Why not just tell us how to kill it?”<br/><br/>He shrugs.  “Didn’t I say?  Reasons!  I have them!  That’s good enough!  I promise to explain everything, but for now, this is all I can provide.  So, are you clear on it all?”<br/><br/>For a moment you look her in the eye again, and you can tell she doesn’t like this, but she’s going along with it for your sake.  So you nod once.<br/><br/>He claps his hands, apparently pleased by your decision.<br/><br/>“Excellent!  Well, that’s everything!”<br/><br/>He pulls out a gold chain from his chest pocket, and then flips open…something…attached to the end of it before swearing under his breath when he glances at it.<br/><br/>“Piss and vinegar, I’m late!  I’ll never hear the end of it!  Well, I have to scoot!  So…”<br/><br/>He dropped the golden round object low…and then begins to spin it in a circle.  As he does, it starts making a strange noise as it spins.<br/><br/><i>TICK<br/><br/>TOCK<br/><br/>TICK<br/><br/>TOCK</i><br/><br/>“…I guess…”<br/><br/><i>TICK</i><br/><br/>“…I’ll see you around.”<br/><br/><i>TOCK</i><br/><br/>And then he was gone.  Just like that.  The golden object spun around, erasing him along its path, and at the tip of its arc it flashed in bright golden light before vanishing, leaving no trace of itself or its owner to be found.<br/><br/>So now it was only you, your love/slave, and time.<br/><br/>And a note at your feet, which you notice and then pick up.<br/><br/>     <i>“Dear Player,<br/>Don’t worry about having to actually do any of that ‘revenge’ stuff right now.  This is more of a build map to help get all this crap organized before the main game is built.  So feel free to explore to your hearts content without any fear of punishment or reprisal.  Or real prize at the moment either.<br/>Sincerely, GM”</i><br/><br/>…<br/><br/>You throw the note away, just one more piece of clutter to clear when the two of you get to rebuilding this place, you figure.<br/>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Your 'camp' is really just a cave, the Plight Artifact, your love, and the ruins of your hometown.<br/><br/>Looking right you can see the cave the two of you were hiding out in during the attack by the Plight.  The entrance has leaves and branches all around it, and if it were covered, you wouldn't be able to tell where the mouth was.  Right now it's open, and from what you can tell can make a good home for now.  Or a storage space.  You can see the tail end of your significant other from the mouth of the cave as she tries to make herself comfortable.<br/><br/>To your left is the ruins of your old hometown.  The ashen ruins and cracked ground don't make for a good remnant of the sweet, homely place you remember, and looking at it brings a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>Before you lies the Plight Artifact, a pale stone structure at least 7 or 8 feet in height.  Along it's face lies a series of numbers, the bottom most flickering in rapid succession while the top is still as rock.  To you, the shape of it looks like a ray of light carved out of stone.]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[You take a moment to look over body, and she takes notice, twisting around a bit to make it easier for you to see.<br/><br/>She's got a fair height, no taller than yourself, and her body is feline in nature.  Yellow fur goes from her head to her uncovered feet, and there are even small pads on the ends of her toes and fingers.  Her hands are actually somewhat soft, despite the 'role' she played at home, and she giggles a bit as you play around with them.<br/><br/>Her eyes are a pair of dark, emotional orbs with white around them, no color inbetween.    Two triangles lie on her head for ears, pink coloring their insides.<br/><br/>At the top of her ass is a long thin tail covered completely in fur, swishing back and forth slowly as you watch it.<br/><br/>You ask to see her goods and she grins for a moment before she drops her clothes to the floor, no underclothes to worry about.<br/><br/>She carries a pair of lovely A cup breasts that bounce around a little as she moves.  Between her hips lies a single pussy, that seems to be getting excited a bit by all your staring.  She has a pair of nice, supple ass-cheeks, which you smack once to her suprise.<br/><br/>Then she gets dressed again, and lingers bent over in your direction for a moment before at last pulling her pants up.]]></description>

The moment passes, however, when you come upon a large holy building at the end of the road.<br/><br/>Large and holy seem to be the two most apt descriptors of this place.  The front of the enormous...<i>temple</i>, as no other word seems to fit, towers over you in the same pale stone as the monument back at your campsite.  Six large pillars of ornate design hold the roof up, standing like sentinels at an eternal attention.  Even the doors, a polished bronze with no real design to them, were oversized, more accomidating for giants rather than yourself.<br/><br/>As you step forward, however, the bronze slab of door folds inward, as if you are expected, and a bright interior blinds you as winds howl forward from within, a sense of something unleashed settling down upon you.<br/><br/>The light subsides, and you can now see the inside of the doorway, but it refuses to stay stable before your eyes, a small haze keeping you from seeing clearly enough to make out much of anything.<br/><br/>You could go inside the temple and see if that helps, or you could turn right around and head back.]]></description>

It is said that altars raised in the name of a demi-god could be used to commune with them and seek wisdom, to allow the mortal to make contact with the IMmortal when they required guidance.
