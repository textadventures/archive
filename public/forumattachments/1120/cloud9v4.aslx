I had a few of my contacts gather this information, but it's as far as they were prepared to go... and they weren't best pleased about doing that." He opens the notebook and shows you a small photo lying between the pages. "There's also this - it's a photo of Yazmin. A bit worn, but you're not having my decent ones."
