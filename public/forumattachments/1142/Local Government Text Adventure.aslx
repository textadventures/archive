    <description><![CDATA[The lobby is a plain but functional room outside the main meeting hall of the village. In keeping with the darkness of Ignarus, the room is dimly lit. Swords decorate the walls as a warning to those who would trespass in this government building. A fancy wooden door is set into the north wall. When you enter, a purple door swings shut behind you with a heavy click.<br/><br/>For all that, the people here are more cheerful than in other villages you have visited in Ignarus. You can hear friendly chatter from rooms on either side. Ignarus may be a dictatorship, but here in the village of Somed, the people still run their <b>local government</b> as a <b>democracy.</b> As long as King Nocens doesn't find out, everything should be just fine...]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This is a huge, echoing chamber shaped like a hexagon. The polished walls shine in the candlelight. A massive circular table sits in the center of the room, surrounded by eight empty stools. Each stool has a sign in front of it. There is one red chair with a plaque reading MAYOR on its arm.<br/><br/>Benches line the walls around the chamber. Although they are currently empty, you can tell that many people have sat in them over the years, enjoying the right to participate in democracy -- even if they have to do it secretly so King Nocens won't find out the truth!<br/><br/>There are many doors in this room, each decorated slightly differently. To the north, there is a tiny door so small it might have been made for a hobbit. There is a poster tacked up beside the tiny door.<br/><br/><b>HINT: There are a few things to do in this room. Try using different objects and exploring! </b>]]></description>

There are a few desks in the room, but they've been shoved against the wall so that they won't be in the way of all the people.<br/><br/>"Hurry up, people!" bellows the bearded man. "We have an election in just a few days, and I want to make sure we're ready when those votes start rolling in."<br/><br/>You can see a beautiful golden pebble high above the charts -- way too high for you to reach. The bearded man could probably get it, though, if you ASKED him about the pebble...<br/><br/><b>HINT: You will have to ASK this man about something, and also TELL him about something. Remember, you will need to say "ask man about ______" and "tell man about __________" -- not just "tell about" or "ask about." </b>]]></description>
