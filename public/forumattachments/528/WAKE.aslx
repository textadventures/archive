          msg ("First, the beacon offers a note about the concept behind evolution that should help in ordering the creatures from the earliest ancestor to the most recent species: <br/><br/>Evolution is not to be confused with adaptation. Adaptation is the process that a creature undergoes to live in a changing environment. Adaptation occurs several times within the life of a single organism. <br/><br/>Evolution, on the other hand, occurs over generations. Evolution occurs not because a creature desires it to, or needs it to. Evolution simply happens. And if the evolved trait (mutation) happens to be useful, then that trait is passed on to the organism's offspring. The overwhelming majority of the time, a mutation is not beneficial to a creature, and is in fact harmful. This makes survival difficult, and passage of a nasty mutation onto offspring very unlikely. <br/><br/>The beacon sputters around your head, telling you that the following is a hint. \"Only use this if you must.\" it says.<br/><br/>Remember the primer that stated the creature evolved at a time when the great majority of species lived in the ocean, as opposed to on the land masses. If you think critcally about that statement, then you can pose this question, and then answer it; \"If most of the life is in the ocean, then what is more likely to happen; A) a species evolves from an aquatic one to a terrestrial one - to fill the empty niches available on land, or B) A species evolves from a terrestrial one to an aquatic one - to compete with the plethora of ocean-dwelling species already established. <br/><br/>The answer to this question is much more likely to be 'A'. That's not to say that 'B' can't or won't happen, but it is significantly less likely. With this in mind, you can much more easily order the organisms in terms of their evolution. Using logic to determine which traits would help an aquatic species as opposed to a terrestrial one, you can start ordering them in that manner.<br/><br/>Finally. the beacon says, \"If you still have difficulty, then 'request order with help' to have me display the current constellations and their orders, which I will tell you is correct, or incorrect.\"<br/>")

Sections within WAKE are defined as \"Parts\" (ex. Part 1, Part 2, etc.). If the hints don't help enough to solve the puzzles, a walkthrough is available from the game's listing page. As one might imagine, the walkthrough is a spoiler for all major parts of the game; but aspects of the game that are not necessary to completion are not covered in the original walkthrough. They can only be accessed through exploration, or possibly, fan-made walkthroughs and advice.<br/><br/>(Also, there are hidden commands that are not necessary to completion or enjoyment of the game, but that reward people who try to find them)<br/><br/>Important Notes #1<br/>-The puzzle types in Wake are not in the \"Escape the Room\" format. Not only that, but the objects or information that is absolutely necessary, all exists within a short sequence of locations. At multiple parts in the game, you will not be able to backtrack. So everything that is necessary to a puzzle's completion is nearby. Sometimes the answer is not a hidden object, but your own problem solving capabilities, based on hints that you gather. <br/><br/>The game progresses in a manner similar to a console shooter. The main areas have a linear path, but each of these main areas often has a plethora of side locations to explore.<br/><br/>Most locations have hidden items. Many of these items are necessary, but some of them are part of the story environment. Some will reward you for exploration with an object that may come in handy - or - some of the rewards are extra plot that fleshes out the story even more.<br/><br/>Important Note #2<br/>-Not all possible commands are listed under the \"objects and places\" or \"inventory\" lists on your Quest, Heads Up Display (HUD). Some things require you to use a command to probe whether or not a response is available. For example; if a description of a scene/location/item describes something specific, that you don't see on the HUD, or as an active conversation, then you may want to try to search for a hidden interactions. <br/><br/>A good example of this occurs in the second location of the game, called Medical Station, there is a crate called \"Alien Supply Crate\". The player obtains this key by talking to Duffy, who will then give the you the key. However, the conversation is not active when choosing to \"talk to\" him. You must type, \"Ask Duffy About Key\" to initiate this conversation.<br/><br/>However, if you use the same command at the previous location, Duffy will not have this special conversation available.<br/>")
