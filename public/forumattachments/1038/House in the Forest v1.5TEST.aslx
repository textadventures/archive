Who are you? Why do you fear one of the people there? And what do they want you for? <br/><br/>These are the questions you ask yourself as you figure out your identity in a little house in the forest. <br/></b></i><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~` <br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br/><br/>This is a simulation of a place where me and my friend made up in a roleplay we deicded to keep it as the home for any RP that use's the certain characters that live here and it consists of the house the forest the field behind the house and a portal in the backroom that leads somewhere special! I made it for them so that they could walk around and interact with the things we desribed in the roleplay but i had to make it so that the person playing it could discover things about the character's since they are the characters we use to Roleplay with.<br/>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[As the door opens you can see that this wasn't a typical girl's room the walls were bright pink but they were darkish purple almost like they wanted the walls to be black but they weren't trying to scare people away so they went with a purple. The carpet on the floor was the only thing that was purple and it made the room look inviting to someone who wanted to come visit. <br/><br/>She had everything a typical room would have on the wall that the door opened up on the bed was extended off the wall. <br/><br/>But there was something off about this room it didn't seem as livable like the others that you've been too. It felt musty and a little cold almost like noone's ben in this room for a while there were books like the ones in the basment scattered all over the place and there was dust everywhere. <br/><br/>The bed looked like no one had slept in it for a while. Just like maddie's room there was a window leading outside of the house but instead of looking out into the forest this was looking out into a field of flowers behind the house so her room was brighter then maddie's. There was also a desk underneath the window also with a bunch of books almost as thick as the ones in the basment but there was also a thick layer of dust covering everything meaning that no one has touched them in quite a long time.<br/><br/>]]></description>

Underneath the window there was a desk with a lamp that was angled down on a laptop that was closed and an old looking book almost as old as the ones that you saw in the basment where you woke up but the title on this one was in english and it wasn't that thick maybe you'll be able to read this one? <br/><br/>To the right of the window her bed was up against the wall and it was surronded by a bunch of roses and other kinds of flowers that she must of picked out in the forest and the field on the other side of the house. They gave the room a nice sceant that floated around making you feel calm and rested and almost a little sleepy. <br/><br/>Right next to you on the wall that the door was opened at was a drawer that she kept all of her clothes in and there was a jewlery box on the top of it. <br/><br/>On the wall to the left was a bunch of art's and crafts stuff that looked like had been used quite recently and if you looked closer you might be able to find something in one of the art's and crafts boxs. <br/><br/>On the wall right next to the window was a key that looked smaller then the key you used on your guest room but it must unlock something. <br/><br/>The floor had a brown carpet that made the room look even more like the bottem of the ocean all that was missing was a bunch a fish somewhere maybe she hadn't made them yet or she hid them from you so you wouldnt think she was wierd. <br/><br/>]]></description>

When you look in front of you there's a path leading to the left and to the right in front of the gate that's surrounding the house. There's a mailbox in front of the gate telling you that they aren't in the middle of nowhere and that a mailman comes out here and delivers the mail so you're not alone. The gate has a hinge and it was hanging open telling you that someone has been through it and they forgot to close it. <br/><br/>To the right there's a forest the one that you could see through the window in Maddie's room and the path winds right into the darkness of the forest so you couldn't see if theres anything at the end of it you might just have to explore to the right you couldn't see anything since the forest extends to the front of the house and to the right as well but there aren't any paths leading into it so it'll be more dangerous to go into there the path that leads to the right goes around the house and leads to behind it maybe to the plains area you could see from lily's window maybe if you go over there you can stand on one of the hills and look to see if you can spot another house or a town...or another human being. <br/><br/>Other then that there was nothing else out here but there was a waterhose laying in the front yard rolled up in the tall uncut grass.]]></description>

It's not a painful feeling more like a continual tug that if you leave the front lawn and not know where you are you'll always know the direction of the house so you wont get lost.<br/><br/>You can see everywhere the path takes you, you can go left to the forest or you can go to the right so you can walk behind the house.<br/>]]></description>

And then you could see bunnies lots of bunnies running around the hole and into the forest and through the tree's carrying plants and food and things into the hole and out again. <br/><br/>But there was a family of black bunnies not doing what the other's were doing they were sitting on the outside of the whole looking around for something and making noises like it were looking for something.]]></description>

    <look>You had it in your pocket and it seemed very very scared of you but it was so small and scared that it couldn't get anywhere and it just layed there in your pocket looking at you with so much fear in it's eyes. It was a black bunny so thats why it was so hard to figure out what it was in the closet in lily's room. I wonder what you need to do with it...don't you remember seeing bunnies somewhere else before?</look>

She seemed to be the same Hieght as lily or a little shorter but 1 or 2 inchs and she also seemed older then her as you could tell by the "shape" of her body, that she was more mature then lily and a lot more then Maddie. <br/><br/>And the more you look at her the more she looks at you and it's a "what are you looking at" look on her face and she's crossing her arms. <br/><br/>That feeling you got when you first walked up to Christan was there when you looked at her too. That gut pulling feeling like you were being drawn to him like some kind of GPS inside of you.
