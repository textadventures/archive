Quest 5.5.1 is now available.

- Containers can now be locked using multiple keys (contributed by Pertex)
- Gamebooks can now have a script that runs for every page (contributed by Pertex)
- New Grid\_DrawImage function to draw an image on the custom drawing grid
- New Setup uses InnoSetup instead of InstallShield, and has a smaller file size

Various bugs have been fixed by me and Pertex. In particular, there were a couple of bugs with timers that meant they used to work unreliably, particularly when playing a game on the web. These have now been resolved, so if you were avoiding using timers, please try them again!

This release is now live for the [web version of Quest](http://textadventures.co.uk/create), and you can also [download the Windows version](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop).

Please [log any bugs you find on GitHub](https://github.com/textadventures/quest/issues).
