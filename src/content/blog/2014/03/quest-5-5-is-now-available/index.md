Quest 5.5 is now out of beta:

- [Download Quest 5.5](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop) for Windows
- or run Quest 5.5 [in your web browser](http://textadventures.co.uk/create)

For details on what's new in Quest 5.5, see the [beta announcement blog post](http://blog.textadventures.co.uk/2013/12/19/quest-5-5-beta-is-now-available/ "Quest 5.5 Beta is now available").

Changes since the beta:

- **Mauricio Díaz García** updated the Spanish translation, and added a new editor translation - so the editor now is _mostly_ displayed in Spanish when editing a Spanish game.
- **Pertex** fixed a few bugs and did some more work on allowing the Editor to be translated.

Thanks once again to everybody who has contributed to this release: Pertex, Jay Nabonne, The Pixie, Guillaume Poulain, Katzy and Mauricio Díaz García, and also to Phillip Zolla for sponsoring the new drawing features in this release.
