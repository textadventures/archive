I am planning to release the first beta of Quest 4.0 in the next week or so.If you would like to help beta test the new version, please email me at [alex@axeuk.com](mailto:alex@axeuk.com) asking to sign up as a beta tester.

Once signed up, I'll send you an email with download instructions when each beta version is released.

I'll be giving away free copies or upgrades to those people who submit useful bug reports and suggestions, so sign up now!
