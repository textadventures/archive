You can now upload games created with [Inform](http://inform7.com/) directly to textadventures.co.uk.

Previously, you could upload an HTML game created using Inform's "Release along with an interpreter" option, but now it's even easier - you can now upload a .z5, .z8, .ulx, .zblorb or .gblorb file directly.

Just head to the "[Submit a Game](http://textadventures.co.uk/submit/submitfile)" link and submit your file. After uploading the file, enter a few basic details and hit Publish. That's it! Your game's listing page is created, where it can be played online (using [Parchment](https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment)) or downloaded.

When publishing a game, you can also choose to keep your game unlisted, which means only people you give the link to will have access.

If you upload a blorb file that includes cover art, that will be automatically added to your game listing.
