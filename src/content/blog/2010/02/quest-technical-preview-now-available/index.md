The first Quest 5.0 Technical Preview version is now available.

This is a **very early release**. Most importantly, it's limited to hand-coding games (there's no visual editor yet), and there's no support for games for earlier versions of Quest. These features will be added over the coming months/years (it's going to be quite a while even before the first proper beta versions).

You can download it from the new Quest 5.0 wiki at [**quest5.net**](http://quest5.net)

If you have any feedback or questions, please drop me an email or [see the forums](http://www.axeuk.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=10).

Enjoy!
