I have created a new website to replace the Quest Games Archive.

It's here: [www.textadventures.co.uk](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/)

It's more flexible and powerful than the old archive. As well as allowing you to post reviews again (something that was disabled a while ago on the old Quest Games Archive due to spam), you can now upload a game and it will be **instantly available for download**.

Logging in

If you ever submitted a game or posted a review to the old Quest Games Archive, you will already have an account on textadventures.co.uk as everything has been transferred over.

In order to log in, click the "forgot your password?" link to receive an email allowing you to create the password for your account.

Once logged in, you can start posting reviews and comments, and you can upload games.

Uploading games

When you upload a game, it will be available immediately for download. Please note that at the moment, each game has to be manually set up for the "play online" feature, so you may have to wait a day or two for this feature to be available for your game.

Also note that I will of course check each game after it has been uploaded, and will remove anything inappropriate - e.g. anything that isn't a Quest game.

Feedback

Please let me know if you have any questions, suggestions or comments about the new website - please email me at [alex@axeuk.com](mailto:alex@axeuk.com).
