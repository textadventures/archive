I am currently developing an extension of the Quest Games Archive that will let you play Quest games within your web browser - no additional software required.

To give this a go, please go to [http://www.axeuk.com/cgi-bin/gamesonline.cgi](http://www.axeuk.com/cgi-bin/gamesonline.cgi) and just click on any game link to begin playing.

All you need is a browser that supports JavaScript and Flash.

So far I have tested this with Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2.

Please post any comments [to the forums](http://www.axeuk.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1595), or drop me an email at [alex@axeuk.com](mailto:alex@axeuk.com).

Note that as this is a beta, the facility may go down from time to time - but if you do notice any problems please let me know.
