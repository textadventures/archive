Inevitably, a few bugs were logged against last week's Release Candidate 1, so I've now fixed them and uploaded a new Release Candidate 2, which you can [download here](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/ "Download Quest").

The biggest bugs fixed were that the Exits tab wasn't showing existing exits, and a memory leak that could cause a hang after switching back and forth in the Code View after making edits. See the [issue tracker list](http://quest.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced?keyword=&status=Closed&type=All&priority=All&release=Quest%205.0%20Release%20Candidate%202&assignedTo=All&component=All&sortField=Id&sortDirection=Ascending&page=0) for full details.

The only thing that might remotely be called a new feature is the ability to translate the labels for the panes in the language template.

I'll be up in Edinburgh watching comedy for the next week, which will be nice as London has descended into rioting as I type this - I'm drowning out the sound of distant sirens with some soothing music, so it will be nice to get away from it for a few days (presuming it doesn't spread to Edinburgh too). If only we could persuade these kids to sit quietly indoors playing text adventures instead. Anyway, I'll be checking my emails and the forums but may be slower to reply than usual.

When I get back I'll fill in the remaining gaps in the documentation, fix any bugs that have been logged and then we'll be ready to go!
