Quest 4.1.5 is now available.

This is a small bug-fix and performance release:

- Loading QSG (save game) files is now faster.
- Fixed a QDK bug with the "create corresponding exit" checkbox, which would become re-checked if it was turned off.

You can download the update from [http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/)
