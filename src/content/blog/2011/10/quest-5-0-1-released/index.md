The first bug-fix release of Quest 5 is now available - [download Quest 5.0.1 here](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/ "Download Quest").

I'm pretty pleased that nothing _too_ major was discovered in the v5.0 release, so thanks once again to the beta testers!

Here's what's new and what's fixed:

- **New feature:** Players can now customise fonts and colours for a game from the new Options window.
- **New feature:** Container "open" and "close" messages can be customised per container.
- **Improved:** More useful error messages if Quest can't load a game file due to an error in one of your scripts.
- **Fixed:** Various issues with Quest 4 games - locked exits in CAS files, sounds in ZIP files, and timers running at the wrong time.
- **Fixed:** Memory leaks in the Editor which could cause Quest to hang when switching to/from the Code View with large games.

For the full list, see the [Closed Quest 5.0.1 Items](http://quest.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced?keyword=&status=Closed&type=All&priority=All&release=Quest%2b5.0.1&assignedTo=All&component=All&sortField=Id&sortDirection=Ascending&page=0) on the Issue Tracker.
