I have reworked the [textadventures.co.uk](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/) website - it still works in much the same way as before, but it's now got a fresh new look. Please take a look and let me know what you think, and if anything's broken!

I've also moved the Quest pages over to [http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/) - I've set up redirects so all the old links should continue to work.

The blog has also been moved to [http://www.textadventures.co.uk/blog/](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/blog/)

There's nothing much new yet, but now the site is fully powered by WordPress it will be much easier for me to expand and update, as we add new sections for Quest 5 etc. Exciting times ahead!
