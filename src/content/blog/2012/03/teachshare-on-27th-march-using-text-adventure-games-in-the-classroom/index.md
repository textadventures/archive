I'll be presenting an online TeachShare on 27th March, giving an overview of Quest and discussing its uses within the classroom.

It will run from 19:00 - 20:00 [UK time](http://time.is/London) (UTC+1).

[See the Vital site for more information](http://www.vital.ac.uk/content/using-text-adventure-games-classroom)

It's free to join in, and the session will be recorded so you should be able to watch it later if you can't make it.

Hope to see you there!
