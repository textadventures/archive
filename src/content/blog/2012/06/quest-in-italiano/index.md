Thanks to Francesco Cordella and Luca Salvicchi, you can now create Quest games in **Italian**.

This is now live on the [web version of Quest](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/create/), and will be added to the next release of the desktop version.

This brings the total number of supported languages to seven:

- English
- French
- German
- Spanish
- Dutch
- Italian
- Esperanto

It is great to see Quest making non-English text adventures possible - and it's nice to see the first non-English games being published on the site. Recent additions include:

- Spanish game [El secreto de las tres fuentes](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/review/567/)
- German game [Bumerang Jack und das Amulett des Lebens - Teil 1 - Die Flucht](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/review/494/)

I look forward to seeing even more - as well as bringing text adventures to audiences who may not speak English, I believe this kind of game could be a great resource for teaching foreign languages too.

It would be wonderful to have even more translations - Welsh, Russian, Chinese would be very interesting additions. How do you create a translation? It's as simple as editing a text file. The page [Translating Quest](http://quest5.net/wiki/Translating_Quest) on the wiki has details, and I'm happy to help with any questions you may have.

Arrivederci...
