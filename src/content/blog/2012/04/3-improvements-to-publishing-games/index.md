I've just finished three improvements to how games are published on [textadventures.co.uk](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/):

**Publishing from the web version of Quest**

You can now publish games from the [web version of Quest](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/create/). From your game list, you can use the "Publish" link that appears next to your game. From the Editor itself, select "game" and hit the "Publish" button that appears in the top right of the screen.

After publishing your game, you can carry on editing it. Changes will not appear publicly until you re-publish.

**Publishing from the desktop version of Quest**

The process for [uploading a game](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/submit-a-game/ "Submit a game") has been improved. The first step is to upload your file - after that, the game name, description and category you've specified in the Editor will be automatically extracted, so there's no need to enter this information again on the upload form.

**Unlisted games**

You can now publish a game without making it fully public - handy if you simply wanted to try out your game online, or maybe to share a game with just a few friends. Simply select "Unlisted", and your game won't appear when browsing the site - only people who know the link will be able to see it (so it works in a similar way to unlisted videos on YouTube).

When logged in, you can see your unlisted games by clicking onto your profile. You can edit your game details to toggle it between public and unlisted at any time, so this may be useful if you want to have a few people beta test your game before releasing it more widely

Combining this with the new "publish" feature in the web editor means that, whether you're using Mac, Linux, Windows, iPad or Chromebook, you can go through the entire game-making process in your browser:

- create a game from scratch and edit it
- publish it as "unlisted" to get a few of your friends to beta test it
- carry on working on the game, publishing updates when you're ready
- when you're finished, switch it to public and share with the world.

So you can now throw away your desktop PC (presuming you weren't using it for anything other than making text adventures).
