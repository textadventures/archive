Microsoft have released [Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2012/09/12/visual-studio-express-2012-for-windows-desktop-is-here.aspx). This is the first time there has been a free version of Visual Studio which is capable of editing mixed-language .sln files.

This means you can now open and edit the source code for the desktop version of Quest without having to use a paid-for version of Visual Studio.

[Download VS Express 2012 for Windows Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-express-windows-desktop)

[More information on contributing to the Quest open source project](http://quest5.net/wiki/Developers)

When you open the .sln file in VS Express, it will complain that it can't open the Setup, WebPlayer and WebEditor projects. You can safely ignore these messages, as they are not required to build and run the main Quest project.

If you have any questions about the code, please visit the [Developer Forum](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=15). Happy hacking!
