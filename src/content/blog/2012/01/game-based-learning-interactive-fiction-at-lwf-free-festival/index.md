[Learning Without Frontiers](http://www.learningwithoutfrontiers.com/) (LWF) is at London Olympia on Wednesday 26th and Thursday 27th January, and alongside the (expensive) main conference there is a [free festival](http://www.learningwithoutfrontiers.com/lwf12/future-of-learning-festival/), featuring a variety of sessions on digital learning.

On Thursday from 10.30 - 12.00, [iO](http://www.io.uk.com/) are hosting a session on Game Based Learning at Salon Bourdieu (S2):

_This session will cover three different areas of the use of games in learning and most importantly games creation in creating learning opportunities for students. The session will draw on practical experiences that have already taken place in schools, refer and develop thinking based on newly released research outcomes, and give delegates solid starting points for them to take away and develop in their schools or organisations._

As part of this, myself, Kristian Still and Tom Cole will be talking about Interactive Fiction and Quest.

_This session will explore how classroom practitioners have enabled their students to start writing, creating and engaging with Interactive Fiction games. The speakers will examine how disengaged readers are now reading and even better engaged in writing games. Examples of how IF is being used in other subject areas such as Science are being explored and developed._

[Register for the festival](http://www.learningwithoutfrontiers.com/lwf12/future-of-learning-festival/) - it's free.

More details are in the [full schedule](http://www.learningwithoutfrontiers.com/lwf12/programme/schedule/) (annoyingly there seems to be no way to link to a particular session, so scroll down to Game Based Learning at 10.30 on Thursday. Also for some reason the programme has me down as "Alex Ward").

Hope to see you there!
