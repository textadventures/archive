Quest 5.2 has now been released, and you can grab it from the [download page](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/ "Download Quest") or [use it online](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/create/ "Create a text adventure game").

For full details of what's new in this version, see the [Quest 5.2 Beta announcement](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/blog/2012/04/14/quest-5-2-beta-is-now-available/ "Quest 5.2 Beta is now available"). The only things changed since the beta are:

- a few bug fixes
- exit links now immediately move the player (unless they have more than one verb) - thanks to James Gregory for suggesting and implementing this
- the Editor will now not save invalid expressions (with mismatching brackets or quotes) to prevent a problem where this would cause the game file to become unloadable
