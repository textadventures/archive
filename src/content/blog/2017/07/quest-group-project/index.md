We are experimenting with creating a large game as a group project. This was started on the forum, and has now moved to Github, where the basic ideas are being thrashed out.

The basic idea is that the player starts at a hub location, and can travel from there to numerous dimensions, with each author creating their own dimension (or two?). We have a framework to handle this, which allows each author to work on their game starting from a simple template, and when we are ready to go live, each game will be sent in, converted to a library and added to the master version. This means people can join the project at any time (even after it has been released potentially), and it can keep going if one person drops out - and in fact it would be quite easy to convert your game to a standalone game, if the whole thing ends up going nowhere.

The project wiki is here: [https://github.com/rheadkid/Quest-Group\_Project/wiki](https://github.com/rheadkid/Quest-Group_Project/wiki)

And there is a forum thread here: [http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/design/topic/3usjedp8bkcgxdbfsd-jza/were-starting-up-a-group-project-who-wants-to-collaborate-the-pixie-has-a-temp](http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/design/topic/3usjedp8bkcgxdbfsd-jza/were-starting-up-a-group-project-who-wants-to-collaborate-the-pixie-has-a-temp)

It looks like it will be a science-fiction/fantasy romp across time and space in a classic, old school style. If you want to get involved and to have a say in how the game will develop, now is the time to join, before it all gets set in stone!
