A couple of months ago, we started accepting more game listings on [textadventures.co.uk](http://textadventures.co.uk), opening the site up to allow [all kinds of web-browser games](http://blog.textadventures.co.uk/2013/06/11/now-accepting-all-kinds-of-web-based-text-adventure-games/ "Now accepting all kinds of web-based text adventure games"), such as those created using Twine, Inform or Undum.

We've now opened up listings even more - with new links to off-site games, all of which can be played in a web-browser, and/or downloaded as an app.

So far we have added listings for [Choice of Games](http://textadventures.co.uk/user/view/bsxtluev90svk5v0nlnbsa/choice-of-games), [Tin Man Games](http://textadventures.co.uk/user/view/53er39qvcu608-rukfpoka/tin-man-games) and [Failbetter Games](http://textadventures.co.uk/user/view/g40_dctgr0sbhvszq52v5g/failbetter-games), with more to come.

We're adding listings manually at the moment, so if you have a link you'd like to add, email [alex@textadventures.co.uk](mailto:alex@textadventures.co.uk) with a description, cover art and category. The only rules are that the game has to be a text-based story game of some description, and it needs to be easily playable - by which we don't mean that the game itself should be easy, just that it should be playable directly within a web browser, or at least available from an App Store.

**Calendar**

We've also added an [events calendar](http://blog.textadventures.co.uk/calendar/). The idea is to list any events that are of general interest to the world of interactive fiction, digital storytelling, and anything related. This includes conferences, meetups, competitions, performances... basically, if we think it's interesting, and it relates to the world of stories, interactivity and technology in some way, then that's the kind of thing we want to add to the calendar.

So, [take a look](http://blog.textadventures.co.uk/calendar/), and [send us an email](mailto:alex@textadventures.co.uk) if you know of anything we should add.
