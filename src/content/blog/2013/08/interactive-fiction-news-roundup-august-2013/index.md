Here's the first of what will probably be an irregular roundup of what's happening in the world of interactive fiction and digital storytelling. Got something to share? Let us know! You can email [alex@textadventures.co.uk](mailto:alex@textadventures.co.uk) or tweet [@TextAdv](http://twitter.com/textadv).

**Choosatron:** This wi-fi interactive story printer is [nearing the end of its Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jerrybelich/the-choosatron-interactive-fiction-arcade-machine) - it's already achieved way over its target amount, and you have until 30 August to pre-order one.

**Seltani:** Andrew Plotkin has unveiled [Seltani](http://eblong.com/zarf/essays/seltani-talk/), an online environment for creating multi-player works of multiple choice interactive fiction.

**IFComp:** The deadline is approaching for signing up on the [IFComp website](http://ifcomp.org/comp13/schedule.html) as an author - you have until 1 September. But don't worry, you have until 28 September to actually submit your game. Looking at the current [prize list](http://ifcomp.org/comp13/prizes.php), you could win $250 - or, if your game isn't so good, you might be the unlucky recipient of a CD of the best of the Eurovision Song Contest.

**A Very Serious Game:** Allyson Whipple and Carly Kocurek are seeking funding on Indiegogo for an educational interactive fiction game called [Choice: Texas](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/choice-texas-a-very-serious-game), about access to abortion. They've currently raised over £2400 and funding will close on 18 September.

**AdventureX:** [AdventureX](http://www.screen7.co.uk/adventurex/) will be held again this December in London - it was a great event last year and we'll definitely be going this time too. Once again it will be free to attend, and they're currently asking for donations to help fund the event - you can contribute by getting yourself a [VIP card](http://www.screen7.co.uk/adventurex/vip_pass.html) for £12.

**Calendar:** We've added an [events calendar](http://blog.textadventures.co.uk/calendar/ "Calendar") to the blog to help keep track of all the interesting things that are going on - let us know if we've missed anything!

That's all for now, but before we go we should quickly mention our new email newsletter "_The Text Adventurer_" - nothing too frequent, just 3 or 4 times per year, covering all of this kind of stuff. We sent out the first issue a couple of months ago so we'll be putting together the second one pretty soon - [sign up now](http://eepurl.com/qjChH) to be sure you get it.
