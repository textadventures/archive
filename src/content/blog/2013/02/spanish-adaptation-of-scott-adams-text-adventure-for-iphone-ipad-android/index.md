The latest Quest-powered app "Aventura Pirata" is now available from the App Store and Google Play, for smartphones and tablets.

- [Aventura Pirata for iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id596370686)

Aventura Pirata is a version of Scott Adams's 1978 game [Pirate Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Adventure), translated into Spanish and adapted for the Quest platform by Mauricio Díaz García.

The game supports the usual hyperlinks and tabs to reduce typing. Selecting an object produces a list of verbs, and exits are visible on the Exits tab (Salidas).

I think this game would be a useful and fun aid for anybody teaching or learning Spanish - it would be great to hear from anybody using it in this way.
