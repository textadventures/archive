The [IFComp 2013](http://ifcomp.org/) has been officially announced!

This is the biggest text adventure competition there is - now in its 18th year. Entries can be written for any interactive fiction platform, and it usually gets some good coverage out there in the wider world. Many authors wait for the competition to release the game that they've been working on all year.

This year, I'm planning to be one of those authors myself, with my first work of interactive fiction - eeek!

There are prizes to be won too. As it's only just been announced, no prizes have been donated yet, but you can get an idea of the kind of thing by looking at [last year's prizes](http://ifcomp.org/comp12/prizes.php).

If you're planning to enter, take a good look through the [rules](http://ifcomp.org/comp13/rules.html). Note that all entries must be previously unreleased - this means if you're working on a game now that you want to enter into the competition, make sure you don't release the game publicly beforehand. This doesn't stop you from having a few beta testers though - and in fact, getting your game tested by a few people is something I'd strongly encourage!

You have until **1 September** to declare your intent to enter and until **28 September** to upload your game. Games are made available a couple of days later, and the results are out on 15 November.

Good luck everybody!
