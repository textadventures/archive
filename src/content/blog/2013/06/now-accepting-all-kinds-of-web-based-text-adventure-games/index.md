We're now accepting a bigger range of submissions at [textadventures.co.uk](http://textadventures.co.uk).

What does this mean? It means that _all_ web-based text adventure games are now accepted!

Why do this? We want to make it easy for people to discover and play text adventure games without having to download any software. And for game authors, we want to make it easy for you to find an audience for your work.

So what can you now upload?

In addition to games developed with our [Quest](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest) platform, you can also now upload:

- self-contained .html game files - like those created by [Twine](http://www.gimcrackd.com/etc/src/)
- ZIP files containing a folder of .html, .css, .js, etc - like those created by [Inform](http://inform7.com) when you use the "Release along with an interpreter" option. (We even extract and display cover art!)
- any other kind of text-based game that runs in a browser. Just upload a single .html file, or a zipped folder.

All uploads get checked by a moderator - so anything this is not a text-based game will be deleted. Categories work the same as before - you can select a category when uploading, but your game will not appear in that category until it has been checked. Work-in-progress, incomplete, test, tutorial exercise games etc. will be put in the Sandpit category.

We hope you enjoy the new flexibility. This feature has just gone live (you can [submit games via this link](http://textadventures.co.uk/create/submit)), so please let me know if you encounter any problems uploading - you can email me at [alex@textadventures.co.uk](mailto:alex@textadventures.co.uk).
