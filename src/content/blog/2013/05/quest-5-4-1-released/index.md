Quest 5.4.1 is now available. If you're using the [web version](http://textadventures.co.uk/create/), you're automatically up to date, and if you're using the desktop version you can [download the update](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/).

This version is a bug-fix release - you can see all the [closed tickets on CodePlex](https://quest.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced?keyword=&status=Closed&type=All&priority=All&release=Quest%2b5.4.1&assignedTo=All&component=All&reasonClosed=All&sortField=Id&sortDirection=Ascending&page=0).

Thanks to Dick Aivia for updating the Dutch language template for this release.

One very minor enhancement in the desktop version - when running a game from the editor, you now have quicker access to the HTML Tools via the toolbar or by pressing F9.

Also one minor breaking change - if you have any exits that run scripts instead of automatically moving the player, you will need to tick a new checkbox on the exit editor "Run a script (instead of moving the player automatically)".

As always, if you have any questions or problems, please let me know - you can email me [alex@textadventures.co.uk](mailto:alex@textadventures.co.uk) or find me on Twitter [@alexwarren](http://twitter.com/alexwarren).
