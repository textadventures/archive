The new-look [textadventures.co.uk](http://www.textadventures.co.uk) website is launching soon! I'm just putting the finishing touches together and doing some more testing, and the site should be ready to launch on **Saturday 20th April**.

In addition to a new look and feel, the entire back-end has been rewritten as well. I'm moving away from a hacked together collection of PHP scripts and WordPress, and to a new site built on .NET and hosted on the [Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/) cloud platform.

There are a number of things I've wanted to add for a while now, but the old site architecture made it difficult for me to change things. On the new website it will be much easier for me to implement new functionality - so watch this space for announcements! There are already a number of nice little changes on the new site to look forward to, and I'll write a blog post about these soon.

The need to migrate data from the old site to the new site means there will be some downtime - hopefully only a few hours. The migration of user accounts takes a while, so I'll be doing those first while keeping the site online. The currently planned migration timetable is:

**Friday 19th April**, 12.00 British Time (11.00 UTC/GMT, 07.00 EST) : New user account sign-up disabled - site remains online and existing users can log in and use the site as normal.

**Saturday 20th April**, 10.00 British Time (09.00 UTC/GMT, 05.00 EST): Site offline for data migration. This should hopefully be completed within a few hours, and then the new site will be available. You will then be able to create new user accounts and use all site functionality.

During the migration, the [blog](http://blog.textadventures.co.uk) and [forums](http://forum.textadventures.co.uk) will continue to be available, and you'll still be able to download the Windows desktop version of Quest via this direct link: [http://files.textadventures.co.uk/quest540.exe](http://files.textadventures.co.uk/quest540.exe)
