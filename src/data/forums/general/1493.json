If I'm correct, I think he's only managed to slag on people in here...and refuses to write Quest games.<br/><br/>For those interested.... My game is about survival. The player is thrust into this whole new world. The player is constantly trying to find out more about his/her identity and what happened. The choices made in the game lead the character thru different serious of events. <br/><br/>Hint about the game: a serial killer is tracking/taunting the player. It's thru choices the player 'happens apon different grizzly scenes' the player must put puzzle pieces together to escape and find out the conclusion to the game(yet to be written).<br/><br/>I just keep coming up with new brilliant ideas and can't seem to stop the game. <br/><br/>Syco",
