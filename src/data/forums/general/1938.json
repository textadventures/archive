Me and one of my best friends find the rats on campus cute, some other people do too, but most don't like them. They don't do any harm though, they eat the food that people carelessly leave lying around.

I recently heard a quote that was so perfect.\n\n[quote:1pk6zxog]I think it's kind of interesting to note that people learn about God around the same time they learn about Santa clause. Most kids find it hard to give up on the pleasant notion of Santa, yet they manage to do it. Why are you as adults believing in things that you should have given up as children? After all, there is as much evidence in the existence of God as there is in Santa, and you managed to get rid of him. [/quote:1pk6zxog]\n\nAnd it's so true. Children are brainwashed to believe in god from a young age, and their religion's ridiculous ways. There is a large majority of people in America that don't believe in evolution, and that's just pathetic. Everyone is entitled to their own view, but believing in something without evidence is just silly. Do Christians even read their bible? I'd bet atheists know more about their religion than they do. The bible tells its followers to murder people who don't believe in god. How disgusting and violent is that? How can you follow something that wrong? Sure that's the old testament, and many will say that's not supposed to be followed. However who decides that you can pick and choose what aspects you follow? I've compiled some of Youtube's best atheist videos explaining how religion is wrong and immoral, and repulsive.\n[url=http&#58;//au&#46;youtube&#46;com/watch?v=vkXOwBIRX7Y:1pk6zxog]Link 1[/url:1pk6zxog]\nThis is my favorite one. It basically describes how christianity is a repulsive religion. If you find a christian that has read the bible they might say &quot;Only the old testament contains violent acts such as stoning.&quot; Well, that's wrong. It's both of them. Video length 10:34\n[url=http&#58;//au&#46;youtube&#46;com/watch?v=-nayP4v4xYg:1pk6zxog]Link 2[/url:1pk6zxog]\nThis one proves how god's plan is impossible. Ever hear a christian say &quot;it was meant to be&quot; or &quot;god wanted it to happen&quot;. Well he didn't, and here's why that is a load of nonsense. Video length 4:58\n[url=http&#58;//au&#46;youtube&#46;com/watch?v=dzzORZhnCao:1pk6zxog]Link 3[/url:1pk6zxog]\nThink you can get in to heaven? Well you're mistaking. The steps to get into heaven in the bible are impossible. Every step has an equal contradiction.

      "HTML": "In this day and age I fail to see how anyone can be religious at all. I recently heard a quote that was so perfect.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I think it's kind of interesting to note that people learn about God around the same time they learn about Santa clause. Most kids find it hard to give up on the pleasant notion of Santa, yet they manage to do it. Why are you as adults believing in things that you should have given up as children? After all, there is as much evidence in the existence of God as there is in Santa, and you managed to get rid of him. </p></blockquote><br/><br/>And it's so true. Children are brainwashed to believe in god from a young age, and their religion's ridiculous ways. There is a large majority of people in America that don't believe in evolution, and that's just pathetic. Everyone is entitled to their own view, but believing in something without evidence is just silly. Do Christians even read their bible? I'd bet atheists know more about their religion than they do. The bible tells its followers to murder people who don't believe in god. How disgusting and violent is that? How can you follow something that wrong? Sure that's the old testament, and many will say that's not supposed to be followed. However who decides that you can pick and choose what aspects you follow? I've compiled some of Youtube's best atheist videos explaining how religion is wrong and immoral, and repulsive.<br/><a href=\"http&#58;//au&#46;youtube&#46;com/watch?v=vkXOwBIRX7Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link 1</a><br/>This is my favorite one. It basically describes how christianity is a repulsive religion. If you find a christian that has read the bible they might say &quot;Only the old testament contains violent acts such as stoning.&quot; Well, that's wrong. It's both of them. Video length 10:34<br/><a href=\"http&#58;//au&#46;youtube&#46;com/watch?v=-nayP4v4xYg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link 2</a><br/>This one proves how god's plan is impossible. Ever hear a christian say &quot;it was meant to be&quot; or &quot;god wanted it to happen&quot;. Well he didn't, and here's why that is a load of nonsense. Video length 4:58<br/><a href=\"http&#58;//au&#46;youtube&#46;com/watch?v=dzzORZhnCao\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link 3</a><br/>Think you can get in to heaven? Well you're mistaking. The steps to get into heaven in the bible are impossible. Every step has an equal contradiction. You're forced to sell everything you own, but than later in the bible you're supposed to give everything away. This makes no sense..*sigh* I'm doomed and going to hell.

[/quote:mmq7aelf]\nAre you talking to me?  When have I ever made a comment as pointless as that?  It sounds like you're already on the extreme defensive here.  May I ask how old you are?  I am 31.\n\nI'll answer your questions though as best I can without trying to offend you.  Offending people doesn't help anyone.\n\nGod vs. Santa.  That is an interesting comment if you really don't have a lot of knowledge about religion.  In fact, you're putting down all religions with that comment, not just Christianity (which is more of a state of being; I will hit that in a second).\n\nBelieving in something with no evidence?  Really?  Where to begin.  Just look around you at nature.  Thousands of species of animals... thousands of species of plants... all working in harmony and perfect order.\n\nLook bigger than thatâ€¦ planets circling a star in mathematical perfection.  The universe itself is expanding at different speeds and changing speeds.  Letâ€™s assume one believes in a â€œbig bangâ€ (wherever that came from) and everything in existence expanded from that one explosion.  Now think of the logistics of an explosion.  Would chunks of an explosion slow down and speed up?  Letâ€™s go further than youâ€™d want to know <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->.  Itâ€™s been said that in an explosion, all the bits will spin the same direction.  Obviously, that is not so with our universeâ€¦ nor even our own solar system.  Planets (and their moons) are all spinning at different speeds and different directions.\n\nWhat about our body systems?  All the systems that make you breathe, digest, pump your blood and carry oxygen.  All of these work together in harmony and every human and animal has the same working systems inside of them.  Did all of this come from an accident?\n\nWhat about your own brain?  Do you think an accidental explosion â€œbillions of years agoâ€ eventually settled everything into place?  If your brain is the conclusion of an accident, how do you know it is capable of logical thought? \n\nCan atheism be proven?  Do atheists believe in something that cannot be proven?  Thatâ€™s faith.  Atheism must be a religion.\n\nOk, letâ€™s back to your comment.  [quote:mmq7aelf]Children are brainwashed[/quote:mmq7aelf].  Would it be any different if children were told at a young age to not believe in God?  Why is it pathetic (as you say) to not believe in evolution?  Now youâ€™re insulting people because they donâ€™t believe in what you believe.  To me, itâ€™s harder to believe in the whole evolution story but thatâ€™s my opinion.\n[quote:mmq7aelf]Do Christians even read their Bible[/quote:mmq7aelf]â€¦ some do, some donâ€™t.  Do Atheists read the Bible? I don't know if you read the Bible but you did go online to find where other Atheists have misinterpreted sayings in the Bible to prove their points.  There's a lot of that out there.  I've looked just to see what people are saying.\nTell me where in the Bible I can read about how I need to murder people because they donâ€™t believe in God.  A lot of problems come from misinterpretation of the Bible.\n[quote:mmq7aelf]who decides that you can pick and choose what aspects you follow[/quote:mmq7aelf]â€¦ There were many changes in the laws throughout the Bible from the Old to the New testament.  There were even changes within the same testament.  For example, after the creation of the world in Genesis, God indicates that we are to eat vegetables and for 2,000 years, you couldnâ€™t eat meat until the time of the great flood when God said to Noah that they could then eat clean animals.\n\nI canâ€™t view the youtube videos in my present location; perhaps Iâ€™ll watch them when I get home.  At least you put a comment about each one so Iâ€™ll respond to the comments for now.  Your first one talks about stoning.  You have to realize that the Bible isnâ€™t just a rule book; itâ€™s a history book too.  Itâ€™s telling about what happened back then; itâ€™s not always an instruction to us.  Just because it said there was a stoning, doesnâ€™t mean we are instructed to do it.  Perhaps the video is more specific and Iâ€™ll reply to that later.\n\nIâ€™m interested in seeing what the second one is about.  Your comment is pretty vague â€œgodâ€™s plan is impossibleâ€ so I canâ€™t really respond to it now.\n\nI will really have to see what video 3 is talking about.  You reference steps to get into Heaven.  There is only one step.  Pray to ask Jesus to admit that youâ€™re a sinner and ask Him to come into your life and save you from your sins.  Bang, youâ€™re done.  And thatâ€™s when you become a Christian.  A Christian is someone who has asked Jesus into their life to save them.\n\nVideo 4.  Praying with â€œno answerâ€.  If I asked you for a million dollars and you said no, should I assume that you didnâ€™t answer me?  Noâ€¦ youâ€™re answer was â€œNoâ€.  People commonly think that God is a genii waiting to grant your wishes.  He doesnâ€™t work that way.\n\nVideo 5.  Jesus appearing when you pray.  Where does it say that in the Bible?  I guess I need to watch the video.\n\nSo last point for now.  You started this article talking about how there is no God because of the inhumane acts done to a dog.  If there is no God, there is no moral base.  How could there be if we all came from an accidental explosion?  If there is no God, there is no Heaven and Hell.  After we die, there is nothing.  If there is no moral base, why is any act considered wrong?  If we are all here by accident with no purpose, canâ€™t we all do what we want to with no consequence?\n\nI want to reiterate that I don't mind having these discussions.  I do it without getting upset and name calling and I expect any others who wish to join in to maintain the same respect.",

The rocks show that the world was underwater at one time.  My question about how it would affect the world is meaning, Biblically speaking, the Bible talks about the waters sprang up.  Creationists generally agree that the continents were together in the beginning but the difference in our beliefs are that God separated the continents to create the worldwide flood releasing waters to â€œspring upâ€ as the Bible saidâ€¦ not polar icecaps (which I should mention has been a total farce and now they are worried of global cooling) Some have theorized that the worldwide flood could have affected the way Carbon 14 atoms decay?  See the problem is in the carbon dating.  Scientists assume that Carbon 14 is a constant and has been a constant for billions of years and the idea of that dating has only been around and monitored since 1950 or so.\nHereâ€™s an interesting site talking about carbon dating.  It wasnâ€™t what I was searching for as an example [u:fcjvwvo2]but itâ€™ll do for now.[/u:fcjvwvo2]  Take note of the letter part way down the page where they sent blind samples to be dated and a website readerâ€™s response to the letter.  What I was searching for though is a reference to carbon dating lava flows that happened recently but have been misdated as millions of years old.  Type lava in the search block and itâ€™s there too.  It also appears that this website says similar things that Iâ€™ve already said toâ€¦ one in particular the statement I just said above about carbon dating not being a constant.\n[url:fcjvwvo2]http&#58;//www&#46;angelfire&#46;com/mi/dinosaurs/carbondating&#46;html[/url:fcjvwvo2]\n\n[quote:fcjvwvo2][quote:fcjvwvo2]Ever heard of mass graveyards in fossils?

Herds move from place to place.  They donâ€™t let one die off due to old age and hang about until all of them die.  The water that â€œshiftedâ€ them to one place is what I was referring to in the flood.

They are not flying apart from each other.  There are, undoubtedly, scientists who speculate that galaxies collide due to gravity or whatever but itâ€™s not proven.  I also have doubts about the universe expanding.  The universe is space or non-matter filled with stars and galaxies, etc.  How does non-matter expand?

If so, does that mean if you could travel far enough to reach the â€œend of the universe<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">*</span>â€ you would fall off the edge?

Itâ€™s a waste of time but hey, let â€˜em go for it if it makes them feel better.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]God is not here to deflect bad things.</p></blockquote>You go from describing how God can create a complex and near-perfect system, where things obey rules, to a system of chaos where the worst of things can happen to the best of people.[/quote]<br/><br/>I never said there was a system of chaos but bad things do happen to good people.  God isnâ€™t here to control us.  He allows us to live with choices.  Otherwise, we are just robots doing his every command without question or choice.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Now with GOOD and BAD things covered.. Seems like nothing can DIS-prove God...

Thank you.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]Certain fossils that should be in one time period are in a totally inaccurate time period.</p></blockquote>I do remember hearing of some of those. Where there are gaps etc.<br/>I've never heard of totally wrong fossils (ie, modern mad having fossils BEFORE Neanderthal man for example)... Apart from some false fossils produced by the Vatican back in the day.[/quote]<br/><br/>There is plenty of information out there on the caveman fraudsâ€¦ Piltdown man, Java man, Lucy, Neanderthal manâ€¦ they are all fake.  Some of them were done by combining human bones with ape bones, etc to â€œproveâ€ the missing links and letâ€™s not forget about the tooth that gave rise to Nebraska manâ€¦ Google it.  I worded that weirdly before.  There are not only gaps but mixups with the time periods.  I have heard of certain dinosaurs, for example, coming before they should have come.  I have heard of fossilized sea critters found in the mountains.  From a worldwide flood perhaps?<br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]Did you know it doesnâ€™t take a million years to make a fossil?</p></blockquote>Yes. All it is is the fact an organic object get's buried in rock and the rock takes on that shape.<br/>Mostly done by sedimentary stuff, but ash can do the same (that volcano in Italy for example had people die in their beds and on the street I thought).[/quote]<br/><br/>That doesnâ€™t really oppose what Iâ€™m saying.  It basically agrees with me so Iâ€™ll move on.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]I recently heard of a minerâ€™s hat found that was fossilized.</p></blockquote>I take it you mean WOOLY hat.<br/>Metal in rock I suppose can be called a &quot;fossil&quot; - but I'd prefer to think of it as &quot;metal in rock&quot;... Since the rock doesn't actually &quot;preserve&quot; the metal at all.[/quote]<br/><br/>I can agree with that concept.  Since I merely said I had recently heard of it, I knew nothing more about it.  So I looked it up and hereâ€™s what I found.  Picture and all:<br/><a href=\"http&#58;//www&#46;answersingenesis&#46;org/creation/v17/i3/fossil_hat&#46;asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http&#58;//www&#46;answersingenesis&#46;org/creation/v17/i3/fossil_hat&#46;asp</a><br/><br/><blockquote><p>It also depends on what you mean by 'fossil'.. Come over to the UK and there's a place called &quot;mother shiptons&quot; where things are 'petrified'... Some stone thing in the water settles on the objects and so slowly turns them to stone. Many objects have been turned since the early-to-mid 90's.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Again, that is agreeing with my statement about the length of time of fossilization.  <br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]The story of the flood has appeared in more than just the Bible.</p></blockquote>So has the fact that the world has undergone numerous fluctuations in water level... The island/city of Atlantis getting flooded. The way Venice is mostly under water. The way loch Ness / The black sea has formed. All because of flooding around the world. Various icecap melting / ice ages have gone on in the last 6-8 (possibly more) thousand years humans have been at least close to civilised... I can't remember how old the Incan/Egyption civilisations were.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>How would a worldwide flood affect the world?</p></blockquote>It would affect the whole world?<br/>If you mean how COULD a worldwide event happen, then the ice-caps melting should give you some indication.[/quote]<br/><br/>What I was saying is that there are multiple records in other civilizations that talk about a worldwide flood.  The rocks show that the world was underwater at one time.  My question about how it would affect the world is meaning, Biblically speaking, the Bible talks about the waters sprang up.  Creationists generally agree that the continents were together in the beginning but the difference in our beliefs are that God separated the continents to create the worldwide flood releasing waters to â€œspring upâ€ as the Bible saidâ€¦ not polar icecaps (which I should mention has been a total farce and now they are worried of global cooling) Some have theorized that the worldwide flood could have affected the way Carbon 14 atoms decay?  See the problem is in the carbon dating.  Scientists assume that Carbon 14 is a constant and has been a constant for billions of years and the idea of that dating has only been around and monitored since 1950 or so.<br/>Hereâ€™s an interesting site talking about carbon dating.  It wasnâ€™t what I was searching for as an example <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but itâ€™ll do for now.</span>  Take note of the letter part way down the page where they sent blind samples to be dated and a website readerâ€™s response to the letter.  What I was searching for though is a reference to carbon dating lava flows that happened recently but have been misdated as millions of years old.  Type lava in the search block and itâ€™s there too.  It also appears that this website says similar things that Iâ€™ve already said toâ€¦ one in particular the statement I just said above about carbon dating not being a constant.<br/><a href=\"http&#58;//www&#46;angelfire&#46;com/mi/dinosaurs/carbondating&#46;html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http&#58;//www&#46;angelfire&#46;com/mi/dinosaurs/carbondating&#46;html</a><br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]Ever heard of mass graveyards in fossils? What does that mean? A heard of animals all fell over and died in one spot and fossilized over millions of years?</p></blockquote>There are elephant graveyards. There are the fact MOST animals are infact herd-like animals and live in 'packs'. There's also water (which can shift and move animals about to one place if they are all dead).<br/>I'm a bit confused as to what you're trying to explain with this point? fossils all in one place meaning that evolution is not a possible explanation? That God has 'moved' all the fossils into the same point (he does THIS but not other easier stuff?).<br/>As I said before, there is a whole human city where people were &quot;fossilized&quot; in their beds, in the street, etc... That was due to a sudden eruption of nothing more then ash - which suffocated the people due to the sulphur and other chemicals (at least if my memory doesn't fail me again).[/quote]<br/><br/>No, my point was that it is more likely that the entire herd of whatever animal died at the same time.  Herds move from place to place.  They donâ€™t let one die off due to old age and hang about until all of them die.  The water that â€œshiftedâ€ them to one place is what I was referring to in the flood.  Not so much that the flood shifted them in one place, but the enormous amounts of sediment that got stirred up buried the herd quickly in one location and that is where they fossilized.

Also yes, with carbon dating it is only accurate back about 1600 years, I did study radition! Look 'half life' if you don't know about them already (no, not the game). Dating dinosaurs millions of years ago with carbon14 is immpossible from that and that hte carbon14 percent most certainly wasn't what it is today (what makes the carbon14 in the first place?) especially if the world really did look like we think it did in the dinosaur eraes.)\n\nBtw, I'm not concluding on anything here, make your own opinions on such things, I'm mereing saying what I know.\n\nIn regrads to flood, under the current understanding of how fossilsiation works, a nice big worldwide flood that suddenly stopped would do the trick nicely, and is a good canidate for what happened, certainly exlpainslots of sedimentary layers, and the trees and whales being like that.\n\nThe fossiling of people you mentioned was hte destructio of Pompey by mount vesurvius, the ash rained down and covered everything, the people weren't so much as fossilised as left holes in the solid ashness. When digging if they find any holes, they pour plaster in them to get the shape back to reveal the horror-filled faces of people as they died all those years ago. It's horriable to look at, trust me.\n\nIn regrads to galaxies (and I've studied astonomy!!), yes they are all flying apart from each other and yes some collide still. Over large areas, everything is moving away from one point (centre of universe, and location of big bang (if it happened, but the galaxies all moving from one point helps support that theory)), over smaller areas galaxies that are close will attrach each other from gravity (everything in the universe is, in fact, attraching everything else but just so weakly), these are generally called superclusters. In several million million years, if people or another sapient species were to study astronomy they would suggest there are only a maximum of 8 galaxies in the universe, as all others have moved too far to see, except the closest who have come closer from the gravity effect.\n\nWhen scietists say 'the universe is expanding', what do they mean? As steve breifly talked about. The universe is defined as everything, so what is it expanding into? The answer: nothing. It's a hard concept to understand. Everything, really, is just moving apart (as far as I understand the meaning).\n\nNo-one's sure how life started, but (this is the important bit here) it did start, at least once. You can talk about the propabilities of something happening, but what are the odd once you know it's happened before? It's unlikely you'll win the lotteryy, but some-one has to win! I read an article suggesting that life started out as simply DNA-like structures that simply self replicated, the ones better at self replicating survived more (like survival of the fittest), getting more complex over time. Fair enough, but it didn't explain where these came from or why there was a need from them to self replicate.\n\nSteve said 'life cannot come from nonlife', fair enough, but to expand this to 'existance cannot come from nonexistance', if the big bang did happened, what the fuck caused it? It did a report on some findings of a team of people somewhere in america (sorry for constant lack to names, etc btw), using a mathematical simulation, ran the data of galxies moving apart backwards to see what would happen. There was a big bang-y thing, then surprisingly, another universe (with similar physical properties to our own) which (forwards) was shrinking and experienced a 'big crunch' (like a reverse big bang, one suggested fate of our universe), but when it became a sigularity again gravity flipped (it had some nice maths for why) and expanded out again in our big bang, this is now called a 'big bounce'. It's been theorised that this may have happened many times before.\n\nTo tangents here: fate of universe, and what started the first universe.\n\nThere are three possible fate of our universe, depending on its density. If the density is higher than the critical density it was collaspe in on itself again in a big crunch, prehaps leading to another universe. If the density is smaller, it will keep expanding forever and the stars will eventually burn out and the universe will become a void. Current working out of the current and critical density have them about the same atm.\n\nIf we simplify universes to donimo for sake of explaining things, each universe supposedly starts the next, so is like one donimo pushing the next. But it remains that something outside the system must start the first domino, the finger coming down and knocking the first one over. Many call this god, fair eonugh, but this force need only be a force, god may exist but what's to say god exists are an anthropomorphicalisation?! Perhaps god doesn't exist in a form that you can pray/talk to, or effects things like we want. Who said he was a guy sitting on a cloud throwing down lightning blots in the first place? (Btw, when I was theist, I mean in the sense I jsut said: I beleive in the force, not the cloud god. I also beleive in the inter-connectiveness of all things, but I'll get to that later)\n\nWell, when people first evolved an started their little tribes and what-not, they had little understand of the world around them, sure they knew not to drink yellow snow and such but why and how things happened was a mystery. Natural disasters were a big one, why did the mountain explod and pour fire on their village, why did flood and fire ravage other tribes. Perhaps, a man livied in the mountain and when he gets angery, he makes the fire, maybe we need to give him things to keep him happy so the monuntain will not explode, a few virgins good enough mr. versuvius? This is the likely origin of such thinking and the pre-text to religion. Seems to me at the moment that reiligion comes from two things: the need for something after death, the need for some-one to help through life. People fear death, its instinctive and over time the survival rate for everyone drops to zero. People die and its sad that they're not around anymore, but where did they go? The idea of simply not existing is too hard for most people, they need to know that they will go onin one orm or another, whether reincarnatingon the earth again, or living in some other world. also life is hard, bad stuff happens, some people can't cope with it and need some-one to hold their hand, this person need not be really real (exist physically), so 'god' fits nicely.\n\nOk, the inter-connectiveness of all things. Anybody read 'dirk gently's holistic detective agency' and 'the hitchikers' guide to the galaxy'? Both are great, read them!!! Anyways, everyone knows that everything is connected, that's how you can know where everything in the universe is from a small piece of fairy cake. Maybe not, but everything i connected, almost. For those who prolly don't know about entwined particles, I'll explain them. I forget he exact process to do so (it's been a while scine studying all this physics! get off my back!), but two photons (or other particles) can be entwined. This makes it so they are exact opposites. Due to the ... damn forgot the name, the thing that basically means you can't know a particles velocity and location at he same time. The act of measuring affects the particle. If you have two entwined photons and you measure one's spin for example, you know that the other's spin is opposite. Before you measure, though both are in neither spin states (schrodinger's cat principle), but when you measure one, you essentially measure the other, this effect is instant. Now for the nice bit: if you move these particles away, say to opposide ends of the universe, it's still instant, even through if there was soemthing travelling at light speed (fastest speed) to tell them other one what to be, it's quicker than that. (Insert 'wtf's here) Scientists don't know how it works, but it does. These photons can be used to transmit data across long distances (meaure or effect one and it opposites on the other), and also in teleporting. You scan one object and campare it to your set entwined particles, then alter them to be the same. Over on mars they see the entwined set has changed, and make an opposite copy from them. Btw, both anyone starts saying, teleporting is impossible: they've already done it, mind you only with a few particles, and doing a person on a planet, scanning from space is impossible (simply from computing limits). If the big bang did happen, and everything came from the same point, then it's entirely possible that more particles are entwined and that things are all connected. I'm not trying to twist science to fit my beleifs btw. All this means is that he fairy cake is possible. so far only mentioned from hitchikers, now dirk gently: he solves crimes like lost cat by holidaying in hawaii, prolly taking the mick but he beleives everything is connected and in the end solved the big mystery.\n\nDamn, I had one more thing I was going to talk about but I forgot. To be fair, I've been sitting here 1 1/2 hours typing all the above out. *crosses fingers that axeuk doesn't mess up posting it, like it always seems to on big posts* (yup, it logged me out in this time, and upon logging in had the post box blank, thank god for copy-paste)",

(Btw, when I was theist, I mean in the sense I jsut said: I beleive in the force, not the cloud god. I also beleive in the inter-connectiveness of all things, but I'll get to that later)<br/><br/>Well, when people first evolved an started their little tribes and what-not, they had little understand of the world around them, sure they knew not to drink yellow snow and such but why and how things happened was a mystery. Natural disasters were a big one, why did the mountain explod and pour fire on their village, why did flood and fire ravage other tribes. Perhaps, a man livied in the mountain and when he gets angery, he makes the fire, maybe we need to give him things to keep him happy so the monuntain will not explode, a few virgins good enough mr. versuvius? This is the likely origin of such thinking and the pre-text to religion. Seems to me at the moment that reiligion comes from two things: the need for something after death, the need for some-one to help through life. People fear death, its instinctive and over time the survival rate for everyone drops to zero. People die and its sad that they're not around anymore, but where did they go? The idea of simply not existing is too hard for most people, they need to know that they will go onin one orm or another, whether reincarnatingon the earth again, or living in some other world. also life is hard, bad stuff happens, some people can't cope with it and need some-one to hold their hand, this person need not be really real (exist physically), so 'god' fits nicely.<br/><br/>Ok, the inter-connectiveness of all things. Anybody read 'dirk gently's holistic detective agency' and 'the hitchikers' guide to the galaxy'? Both are great, read them!!! Anyways, everyone knows that everything is connected, that's how you can know where everything in the universe is from a small piece of fairy cake. Maybe not, but everything i connected, almost. For those who prolly don't know about entwined particles, I'll explain them. I forget he exact process to do so (it's been a while scine studying all this physics! get off my back!), but two photons (or other particles) can be entwined. This makes it so they are exact opposites. Due to the ... damn forgot the name, the thing that basically means you can't know a particles velocity and location at he same time. The act of measuring affects the particle. If you have two entwined photons and you measure one's spin for example, you know that the other's spin is opposite. Before you measure, though both are in neither spin states (schrodinger's cat principle), but when you measure one, you essentially measure the other, this effect is instant. Now for the nice bit: if you move these particles away, say to opposide ends of the universe, it's still instant, even through if there was soemthing travelling at light speed (fastest speed) to tell them other one what to be, it's quicker than that. (Insert 'wtf's here) Scientists don't know how it works, but it does. These photons can be used to transmit data across long distances (meaure or effect one and it opposites on the other), and also in teleporting. You scan one object and campare it to your set entwined particles, then alter them to be the same. Over on mars they see the entwined set has changed, and make an opposite copy from them. Btw, both anyone starts saying, teleporting is impossible: they've already done it, mind you only with a few particles, and doing a person on a planet, scanning from space is impossible (simply from computing limits). If the big bang did happen, and everything came from the same point, then it's entirely possible that more particles are entwined and that things are all connected. I'm not trying to twist science to fit my beleifs btw. All this means is that he fairy cake is possible. so far only mentioned from hitchikers, now dirk gently: he solves crimes like lost cat by holidaying in hawaii, prolly taking the mick but he beleives everything is connected and in the end solved the big mystery.<br/><br/>Damn, I had one more thing I was going to talk about but I forgot. To be fair, I've been sitting here 1 1/2 hours typing all the above out. *crosses fingers that axeuk doesn't mess up posting it, like it always seems to on big posts* (yup, it logged me out in this time, and upon logging in had the post box blank, thank god for copy-paste)",

Is it constant? .. The speed must be equal to or faster then the speed of light (unless it's slowing down) since - we can't see the edge. In either case, that can only be theorised.\n\nWhat's it expanding into? As Elex pointed out, nothingness is a hard concept to grip - in my mind it's similar to an air-pocket, where the air travels faster over a wing casing the wing to lift - the void causes lift in order to fill it.\n\nNow, the problem *I* have with an expanding universe is this: If it's expanding, where is all the EXTRA matter in the universe coming from? You can't suddenly create matter from nothing - it takes HUGE amounts of energy. You'd be having millions of mini big-bangs all along the outside edge of the universe over and over and over again...\nThe energy left over (microwave radiation - or TV static which you can see as an everyday person) is dying down - very slowly - but it is...\nAs the universe expands more, the energy within the universe will become less (ie more &quot;spread out&quot;) until it can't any longer.\nAs for falling off the edge? If you ever actually reached the edge you wouldn't 'see' it, nor could you pass it.\n\nI think this is where the change in the speed of light theory comes into play.\nA theory says, change the speed of light, energy etc all change and another &quot;big bang&quot; ooccurs.\n\nI don't try to theorise before the big bang, I've heard of no-time and the multiple universe collision theories but I don't care really. God - as a force - could have caused the big bang. And so, s/he/it as a result, would have 'created the Earth'.\nBut in 7 (6 actually) days, creating everything one step after another? Nah.\n\nNow, let's throw this in to hurt your brain: are black holes stationary to the centre of the universe?\nAs everything is moving away from the centre of the universe - but black holes have become SO heavy they kind of tear a rip in space-time - are black holes (or maybe more precisely, the mass that forms the black hole) still moving?\nAre they heavy enough to cause a static point in the universe?\nDoes/Should that effect the theories on galaxies that are moving apart (since I've heard it a few times that the centres of galaxies are thought to be major black holes).\n\n[quote:m5be1pn1]Life cannot come from non-life. It has been proven[/quote:m5be1pn1]Please - that sounds a bit TOO creationist.\nAre you telling me that with massive amount of regular background universe radiation, along with everything the sun checks out - and more (objects from other systems, radiation from other suns), could not alter or fuse atoms, chemicals and/or enzymes together to create the first ever sub-single celled life-form (I say life-form since an organism must have parts to work together - life-form may simply do an exchange process... water+suger-&gt;energy+CO2 for example)... which then mutated further into the first celled organism?\n\nOut of all the things to happen, in all the time that can be observed from starlight etc, I find it to be one of the most likely things to have happened ever.\nBut, again, all theorized so what does anyone know? It could have been the magical cake-fairy who thought &quot;I want someone to bake cakes in several million years&quot; and so created the first bit of life.\n\n[quote:m5be1pn1]I never said there was a system of chaos[/quote:m5be1pn1]No, you're right - but you did describe it.\nIf God is not here to control us, and he is not here to &quot;deflect bad things&quot; (his wrath actually means giving out bad things), and he gives out good things (rewards etc) then infact he IS here to control us - to some pre-conceived rules at that (what to reward, what to discipline, etc)! Yet, as I said, bad things happen to good men, which means that rules don't matter.. And infact God &quot;has a plan&quot;... And he 'Planned' that good things happen to bad men, and vice-versa... Which doesn't sound like any sort of GOOD plan to me - but of course he can't control anything since he's given us free will.... Except when he moved the continents etc.\nWho says God wasn't overthrown by the Devil again? <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->\n\n[quote:m5be1pn1]Now that was hilarious.

[/quote:m5be1pn1]I thought Neadertal man was proven to have co-existed with modern-man until they were wiped out?\nLike, several (hundred/whatever) years worth of evidence?\n\nThe &quot;fossil hat&quot; is - as I commented earlier - petrified and not ACTUALLY fossilized.\nI think that it's a difference in mineral's being deposited rather then sedimentary or lava methods.\nNot really sure as I am not too interested in looking up these specifics.\n\nMinor ice-ages... Have shown that water levels were higher when an ice-age struck and then warmed up again actually lowering the water levels.\nThis can be seen with the fiords/whatever in greenland, along with the locks in Scotland, and as I said earlier - the black sea is a prime example of the water level changing and trapping water into an area.\n\nThe fact most of man came from the European/Asian/African continent mass (probably more African) continent - not to mention Roman, Nordic and Egyption major cultural influences across the globe, I have no surprise there is a common story or two around the globe... Remember: COMMON.\nThey don't all marry up, none of them all say exactly the same thing.\nIt's like ALL religion's - they send out basically the same big picture, but then fight on all the little stuff, and go for broke with things like creationism - where everything's only been in existence for about 6 thousand years.\n\nWhen you say Carbon14 being a constant, you actually mean &quot;constant level of carbon14 in the atmosphere/foodchain&quot;.. So the level an organism absorbs would be comparable to it's size and the part of the animal that you've got (bones obviously store it differently to hair or tissue) not to mention how the object's been kept (heated/frozen/moved/soaked/etc) AND the part of the world it's from.\n\nSo to effectively carbon date something, you need to know what it is (wood? specifically what animal bone/part?), where it's come from (high up? Low under sea? etc), how it's been treated in the meantime, and the size of the animal.\n\nElex - Carbon14 is an isotope of a normal carbon atom - carbon with some extra protons/neutrons. These decay at a random rate back to normal carbon atoms.\n\nNow, I just said random didn't I? .. Yes.\nI hope everyone is familiar with half-lives, and how a large enough group of radioactive substances usually have an exponential halflife where after x time, [b:m5be1pn1]roughly[/b:m5be1pn1] half the radioactive atoms have decayed to a stable form... Then after x time again half THOSE have decayed... etc.\nA line on a graph slowly reaching 0 but never actually reaching it.\n\nNOW, after a while the difference between those two states get's SO tiny, that you can't measure the difference:\n40 million years gives no measurable difference to 100 thousand years for example.\nThis is because the levels of carbon14 will be about the same in both samples - again, ABOUT... It's all about measurable differences, and the degree of randomness of the decay.\n\nThe website provided is totally rubbish. Spouting things such as &quot;blind tests prove&quot; - they prove that you don't know what you're talking about.\nProviding a shell sample which get's an incorrect age - with no /actual/ proof means nothing other then lead suspicion to what information was provided in the first place.\nBlind tests, as I've commented before, don't work since you give little to no detail about what exactly is being tested.\n\nVolcanic rock being tested is curious, although the very fact it's just errupted means that's the carbon14 in the top layer of the outer core/lower mantle.. The age of 'the rock itself' *IS* a few million years.... How is that 'wrong'?\nIf you find out what they do to measure lava flows age - and what they use as a point of age - that'll be interesting.\n\n[quote:m5be1pn1]No, my point was that it is more likely that the entire herd of whatever animal died at the same time.[/quote:m5be1pn1]totally possible. Getting trapped in caves that collapse, caught in bad accidents (land slides, etc) or fires or poison gas etc (poison gas such as tar-pits and sulphur monoxide etc - naturally occurring stuff).\nWere you trying to say that animals over many years died?\n\nAgain, it depends on the situation - large pools of water can hold many generations of fish/water life... Which can be buried under sediment easily.\nAnimals in herds sometimes live in the same areas (lions patrol areas, not uncommon to stick to the same areas), elephants pass on information such as travelling routes that are remembered all their lives (and so mass graveyards happen).\nNot to mention monkeys/apes, meercats, etc..\n\n[quote:m5be1pn1]I donâ€™t believe God moves fossils.

Iâ€™m not getting the selfish reason you suggest.[/quote:m5be1pn1]No - you help others BECAUSE you're helping yourself.\nIt's ike going to Church every Sunday and giving money...\nYou help the Church out by donating money for them to do whatever with it.\n.. You mainly go to pray and worship, listen to a sermon, whatever... Which you do 'knowing' it 'helps' you (may help out in numerous ways, physically, emotionally, mentally, socially, spiritually, etc).\n.. Therefore you do a charitable act based on a selfish act.\n- I'm not saying I don't do it.. Sometimes when I get up to grab something I will offer to grab something else for other people too, etc.\nBUT, surely the most charitable deed is to do it with no knowledge of gain to yourself until a while later.\nAnd surely, we should live by the motto &quot;help and help alike&quot; meaning people help each other.\n\nBut anyway, my point was if your actions are motivated by your religion (religious outreach programme, giving money to the poor, washing a beggars feet, having unprotected sex, etc) then you need another look at your life and why you do them.\n\nOh, and Elex - firefox is king <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> .",

You'd be having millions of mini big-bangs all along the outside edge of the universe over and over and over again...<br/>The energy left over (microwave radiation - or TV static which you can see as an everyday person) is dying down - very slowly - but it is...<br/>As the universe expands more, the energy within the universe will become less (ie more &quot;spread out&quot;) until it can't any longer.<br/>As for falling off the edge? If you ever actually reached the edge you wouldn't 'see' it, nor could you pass it.<br/><br/>I think this is where the change in the speed of light theory comes into play.<br/>A theory says, change the speed of light, energy etc all change and another &quot;big bang&quot; ooccurs.<br/><br/>I don't try to theorise before the big bang, I've heard of no-time and the multiple universe collision theories but I don't care really. God - as a force - could have caused the big bang. And so, s/he/it as a result, would have 'created the Earth'.<br/>But in 7 (6 actually) days, creating everything one step after another? Nah.<br/><br/>Now, let's throw this in to hurt your brain: are black holes stationary to the centre of the universe?<br/>As everything is moving away from the centre of the universe - but black holes have become SO heavy they kind of tear a rip in space-time - are black holes (or maybe more precisely, the mass that forms the black hole) still moving?<br/>Are they heavy enough to cause a static point in the universe?<br/>Does/Should that effect the theories on galaxies that are moving apart (since I've heard it a few times that the centres of galaxies are thought to be major black holes).<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Life cannot come from non-life. It has been proven</p></blockquote>Please - that sounds a bit TOO creationist.<br/>Are you telling me that with massive amount of regular background universe radiation, along with everything the sun checks out - and more (objects from other systems, radiation from other suns), could not alter or fuse atoms, chemicals and/or enzymes together to create the first ever sub-single celled life-form (I say life-form since an organism must have parts to work together - life-form may simply do an exchange process... water+suger-&gt;energy+CO2 for example)... which then mutated further into the first celled organism?<br/><br/>Out of all the things to happen, in all the time that can be observed from starlight etc, I find it to be one of the most likely things to have happened ever.<br/>But, again, all theorized so what does anyone know? It could have been the magical cake-fairy who thought &quot;I want someone to bake cakes in several million years&quot; and so created the first bit of life.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I never said there was a system of chaos</p></blockquote>No, you're right - but you did describe it.<br/>If God is not here to control us, and he is not here to &quot;deflect bad things&quot; (his wrath actually means giving out bad things), and he gives out good things (rewards etc) then infact he IS here to control us - to some pre-conceived rules at that (what to reward, what to discipline, etc)! Yet, as I said, bad things happen to good men, which means that rules don't matter.. And infact God &quot;has a plan&quot;... And he 'Planned' that good things happen to bad men, and vice-versa... Which doesn't sound like any sort of GOOD plan to me - but of course he can't control anything since he's given us free will.... Except when he moved the continents etc.<br/>Who says God wasn't overthrown by the Devil again? <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --><br/><br/><blockquote><p>Now that was hilarious.

Have shown that water levels were higher when an ice-age struck and then warmed up again actually lowering the water levels.<br/>This can be seen with the fiords/whatever in greenland, along with the locks in Scotland, and as I said earlier - the black sea is a prime example of the water level changing and trapping water into an area.<br/><br/>The fact most of man came from the European/Asian/African continent mass (probably more African) continent - not to mention Roman, Nordic and Egyption major cultural influences across the globe, I have no surprise there is a common story or two around the globe... Remember: COMMON.<br/>They don't all marry up, none of them all say exactly the same thing.<br/>It's like ALL religion's - they send out basically the same big picture, but then fight on all the little stuff, and go for broke with things like creationism - where everything's only been in existence for about 6 thousand years.<br/><br/>When you say Carbon14 being a constant, you actually mean &quot;constant level of carbon14 in the atmosphere/foodchain&quot;.. So the level an organism absorbs would be comparable to it's size and the part of the animal that you've got (bones obviously store it differently to hair or tissue) not to mention how the object's been kept (heated/frozen/moved/soaked/etc) AND the part of the world it's from.<br/><br/>So to effectively carbon date something, you need to know what it is (wood? specifically what animal bone/part?), where it's come from (high up? Low under sea? etc), how it's been treated in the meantime, and the size of the animal.<br/><br/>Elex - Carbon14 is an isotope of a normal carbon atom - carbon with some extra protons/neutrons. These decay at a random rate back to normal carbon atoms.<br/><br/>Now, I just said random didn't I? .. Yes.<br/>I hope everyone is familiar with half-lives, and how a large enough group of radioactive substances usually have an exponential halflife where after x time, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">roughly</span> half the radioactive atoms have decayed to a stable form... Then after x time again half THOSE have decayed... etc.<br/>A line on a graph slowly reaching 0 but never actually reaching it.<br/><br/>NOW, after a while the difference between those two states get's SO tiny, that you can't measure the difference:<br/>40 million years gives no measurable difference to 100 thousand years for example.<br/>This is because the levels of carbon14 will be about the same in both samples - again, ABOUT... It's all about measurable differences, and the degree of randomness of the decay.<br/><br/>The website provided is totally rubbish. Spouting things such as &quot;blind tests prove&quot; - they prove that you don't know what you're talking about.<br/>Providing a shell sample which get's an incorrect age - with no /actual/ proof means nothing other then lead suspicion to what information was provided in the first place.<br/>Blind tests, as I've commented before, don't work since you give little to no detail about what exactly is being tested.<br/><br/>Volcanic rock being tested is curious, although the very fact it's just errupted means that's the carbon14 in the top layer of the outer core/lower mantle.. The age of 'the rock itself' *IS* a few million years.... How is that 'wrong'?<br/>If you find out what they do to measure lava flows age - and what they use as a point of age - that'll be interesting.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>No, my point was that it is more likely that the entire herd of whatever animal died at the same time.</p></blockquote>totally possible. Getting trapped in caves that collapse, caught in bad accidents (land slides, etc) or fires or poison gas etc (poison gas such as tar-pits and sulphur monoxide etc - naturally occurring stuff).<br/>Were you trying to say that animals over many years died?<br/><br/>Again, it depends on the situation - large pools of water can hold many generations of fish/water life... Which can be buried under sediment easily.<br/>Animals in herds sometimes live in the same areas (lions patrol areas, not uncommon to stick to the same areas), elephants pass on information such as travelling routes that are remembered all their lives (and so mass graveyards happen).<br/>Not to mention monkeys/apes, meercats, etc..<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I donâ€™t believe God moves fossils. </p></blockquote>... Only that he moves continents? <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --><br/>Again, first thing that popped into my head there... Sorry, cheap shot.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>You help others but you also help yourself. Iâ€™m not getting the selfish reason you suggest.</p></blockquote>No - you help others BECAUSE you're helping yourself.<br/>It's ike going to Church every Sunday and giving money...<br/>You help the Church out by donating money for them to do whatever with it.<br/>.. You mainly go to pray and worship, listen to a sermon, whatever... Which you do 'knowing' it 'helps' you (may help out in numerous ways, physically, emotionally, mentally, socially, spiritually, etc).<br/>.. Therefore you do a charitable act based on a selfish act.<br/>- I'm not saying I don't do it.. Sometimes when I get up to grab something I will offer to grab something else for other people too, etc.<br/>BUT, surely the most charitable deed is to do it with no knowledge of gain to yourself until a while later.<br/>And surely, we should live by the motto &quot;help and help alike&quot; meaning people help each other.<br/><br/>But anyway, my point was if your actions are motivated by your religion (religious outreach programme, giving money to the poor, washing a beggars feet, having unprotected sex, etc) then you need another look at your life and why you do them.<br/><br/>Oh, and Elex - firefox is king <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> .",

Since I believe God created everything in 6 days, I don't believe their was a &quot;first celled organism&quot;.\nFurther, but more related to the galaxy bit, why aren't we crashing into the sun?  Why is the earth and every planet in our solar system flying around the sun in &quot;perfect&quot; orbit.  Perfect meaning that we aren't occasionally losing planets when they get too far from the sun or other planets aren't flying into the sun when they get too close.  There are a couple things that make me ponder about that with the whole expanding universe/ billions of years theory.  Perhaps one may say that the amount of gravity brings the planet closer to the sun but then, I don't know, slingshots it past the sun to the planets maximum edge of the ellipse and then the sun's gravity brings it back again.  I still don't see why it wouldn't crash into the sun.  But thinking of that concept, why aren't galaxies spinning around one another as opposed to colliding?  The solar system seems uniform to a degree and the rest of the universe seems to be flying around in mayhem due to gravity and black holes and such.  I'm not trying to prove a point, just posing a puzzle.\n\n\n[quote:3ov96041][quote:3ov96041]I never said there was a system of chaos[/quote:3ov96041]No, you're right - but you did describe it.\nIf God is not here to control us, and he is not here to &quot;deflect bad things&quot; (his wrath actually means giving out bad things), and he gives out good things (rewards etc) then infact he IS here to control us - to some pre-conceived rules at that (what to reward, what to discipline, etc)!

My answer in a nutshell was yes.  In some cases, probably not all, God allows bad things to happen to good men to test their faith.  It's talked about in the Bible.  Job, for instance.  Lost everything, wife, kids, house, animals, etc... sounds harsh but that's why people who study the Bible, try to learn from those things.  God's plan?  Although we can't know what his ultimate plan was, we can say, again Biblically speaking, that we were created to praise Him but we were initially created to live forever.  Sin entered the world with the help of Satan tempting Eve with the forbidden fruit and Adam took it, then God cursed the entire creation.  That was not his plan.  Ok... so God knows all and he would have seen that Adam and Eve would screw things up and a few thousand years later, people would be debating it on the internet, so why did he still create us?  In short, we can only guess.\nWho says God was EVER overthrown a first time?\n\n[quote:3ov96041]Geology: sea critters in the mountains..\nMountains are formed (not always) where: two plates push together and they either BOTH rise up (also commonly creating volcanoes - which can also mean hot springs due to the thinner crust) or one slides over the other.\nBOTH methods mean they were lower down then they used to be.\nThey could have actually been under the sea while life thrived - before any land-masses even existed.\nVarious fossilization methods could apply to them.[/quote:3ov96041]\n\nLike a lot of things, we have been discussing, this is relative.

What you're saying in the end is that we should do good to others just because we should... not because our religion says to.  I can't say that's 100% true.  The Bible says &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;  The Golden Rule was based off of that, I presume.  Non-religious people abide by it.

There is ongoing speculation and debate about the &quot;proof&quot; of this occurence.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]Life cannot come from non-life. It has been proven</p></blockquote>Please - that sounds a bit TOO creationist.[/quote]  Is that the same as if one guy said to another, &quot;hey check out that girls rack&quot;... and the other guy says, &quot;that sounds a bit TOO male.&quot;  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --><br/>If I am taking the creationist viewpoint, it will sound resoundingly &quot;creationist&quot;.

Since I believe God created everything in 6 days, I don't believe their was a &quot;first celled organism&quot;.<br/>Further, but more related to the galaxy bit, why aren't we crashing into the sun?  Why is the earth and every planet in our solar system flying around the sun in &quot;perfect&quot; orbit.  Perfect meaning that we aren't occasionally losing planets when they get too far from the sun or other planets aren't flying into the sun when they get too close.  There are a couple things that make me ponder about that with the whole expanding universe/ billions of years theory.  Perhaps one may say that the amount of gravity brings the planet closer to the sun but then, I don't know, slingshots it past the sun to the planets maximum edge of the ellipse and then the sun's gravity brings it back again.  I still don't see why it wouldn't crash into the sun.  But thinking of that concept, why aren't galaxies spinning around one another as opposed to colliding?  The solar system seems uniform to a degree and the rest of the universe seems to be flying around in mayhem due to gravity and black holes and such.  I'm not trying to prove a point, just posing a puzzle.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]I never said there was a system of chaos</p></blockquote>No, you're right - but you did describe it.<br/>If God is not here to control us, and he is not here to &quot;deflect bad things&quot; (his wrath actually means giving out bad things), and he gives out good things (rewards etc) then infact he IS here to control us - to some pre-conceived rules at that (what to reward, what to discipline, etc)! Yet, as I said, bad things happen to good men, which means that rules don't matter.. And infact God &quot;has a plan&quot;... And he 'Planned' that good things happen to bad men, and vice-versa... Which doesn't sound like any sort of GOOD plan to me - but of course he can't control anything since he's given us free will.... Except when he moved the continents etc.<br/>Who says God wasn't overthrown by the Devil again? <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->[/quote]<br/><br/>I've had a similar conversation with someone about this recently and his final question was, so did God create humans merely to praise him.  My answer in a nutshell was yes.  In some cases, probably not all, God allows bad things to happen to good men to test their faith.  It's talked about in the Bible.  Job, for instance.  Lost everything, wife, kids, house, animals, etc... sounds harsh but that's why people who study the Bible, try to learn from those things.  God's plan?  Although we can't know what his ultimate plan was, we can say, again Biblically speaking, that we were created to praise Him but we were initially created to live forever.  Sin entered the world with the help of Satan tempting Eve with the forbidden fruit and Adam took it, then God cursed the entire creation.  That was not his plan.  Ok... so God knows all and he would have seen that Adam and Eve would screw things up and a few thousand years later, people would be debating it on the internet, so why did he still create us?  In short, we can only guess.<br/>Who says God was EVER overthrown a first time?<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Geology: sea critters in the mountains..<br/>Mountains are formed (not always) where: two plates push together and they either BOTH rise up (also commonly creating volcanoes - which can also mean hot springs due to the thinner crust) or one slides over the other.<br/>BOTH methods mean they were lower down then they used to be.<br/>They could have actually been under the sea while life thrived - before any land-masses even existed.<br/>Various fossilization methods could apply to them.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Like a lot of things, we have been discussing, this is relative.  If you look at this from an evolutionary standpoint (billions of years), this makes sense.  If you look at this form a young earth (6,000 or so years) creationist standpoint, this also makes sense but in a different way.  I could even agree that the critters were under sea first but the difference is how fast the events occurred.  <br/><br/><blockquote><p>Neanderthal manâ€¦ they are all fake. </p></blockquote>I thought Neadertal man was proven to have co-existed with modern-man until they were wiped out?<br/>Like, several (hundred/whatever) years worth of evidence?[/quote]<br/><br/>Again. relative.  Some think they were ape-like, some think they were humans.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Minor ice-ages... Have shown that water levels were higher when an ice-age struck and then warmed up again actually lowering the water levels.<br/>This can be seen with the fiords/whatever in greenland, along with the locks in Scotland, and as I said earlier - the black sea is a prime example of the water level changing and trapping water into an area.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>I do believe there could have been an ice age (or minor ice ages) after the earth had been covered in water for a period of time.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>When you say Carbon14 being a constant, you actually mean &quot;constant level of carbon14 in the atmosphere/foodchain&quot;.. So the level an organism absorbs would be comparable to it's size and the part of the animal that you've got (bones obviously store it differently to hair or tissue) not to mention how the object's been kept (heated/frozen/moved/soaked/etc) AND the part of the world it's from.<br/><br/>So to effectively carbon date something, you need to know what it is (wood? specifically what animal bone/part?), where it's come from (high up? Low under sea? etc), how it's been treated in the meantime, and the size of the animal.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>Basically, I suppose.  I had read a book about it but I don't recall some of the real intricate details.  It was almost more than I wanted to know about Carbon 14, lol.<br/><br/>NOW, after a while the difference between those two states get's SO tiny, that you can't measure the difference:<br/>40 million years gives no measurable difference to 100 thousand years for example.<br/>This is because the levels of carbon14 will be about the same in both samples - again, ABOUT... It's all about measurable differences, and the degree of randomness of the decay.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>The website provided is totally rubbish. </p></blockquote><br/><br/>I had said.... &quot;as an example <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">but itâ€™ll do for now</span>.&quot;  It was a quick reference in regards to the lava bit.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Volcanic rock being tested is curious, although the very fact it's just errupted means that's the carbon14 in the top layer of the outer core/lower mantle.. The age of 'the rock itself' *IS* a few million years.... How is that 'wrong'?</p></blockquote><br/><br/>*IF* the age of the rock itself is a few million years...<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Were you trying to say that animals over many years died?</p></blockquote>  No, relating it to the Flood event.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]I donâ€™t believe God moves fossils. </p></blockquote>... Only that he moves continents? <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --><br/>Again, first thing that popped into my head there... Sorry, cheap shot.[/quote]<br/><br/>I know you're partially joking, that's ok.  But to clarify, God didn't move fossils because they were too heavy; I don't believe there was a need for him to do that.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>It's ike going to Church every Sunday and giving money...<br/>You help the Church out by donating money for them to do whatever with it.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>I do that because the Bible says to in Malachi.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>.. You mainly go to pray and worship, listen to a sermon, whatever... Which you do 'knowing' it 'helps' you (may help out in numerous ways, physically, emotionally, mentally, socially, spiritually, etc).<br/>.. Therefore you do a charitable act based on a selfish act.<br/>- I'm not saying I don't do it.. Sometimes when I get up to grab something I will offer to grab something else for other people too, etc.<br/>BUT, surely the most charitable deed is to do it with no knowledge of gain to yourself until a while later.<br/>And surely, we should live by the motto &quot;help and help alike&quot; meaning people help each other.<br/><br/>But anyway, my point was if your actions are motivated by your religion (religious outreach programme, giving money to the poor, washing a beggars feet, having unprotected sex, etc) then you need another look at your life and why you do them.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>That's kind of a weird way to think about it but if you think that's some form of selfishness, I'm not going to debate it.  What you're saying in the end is that we should do good to others just because we should... not because our religion says to.  I can't say that's 100% true.  The Bible says &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;  The Golden Rule was based off of that, I presume.  Non-religious people abide by it.  In some form, we are taught from others as children to be kind to others.  It's an interesting concept but I don't feel like I need another look at my life in the sense you are presenting.",

It's a tiny amount like 0.00000001 scine the start of the universe or something like that. But it is slowing.[/quote:2k8v10rz]No they haven't.\nA creationist physicist (if you can believe such an oxymoron) put forward some bizarro proof that the speed of light went from 303,000-&gt;300,000m/s from 1700-1800 (ish) and 300,000-&gt;298,xxx/s from 1850-&gt;2000 (again, ish)..\nNot to mention the various balls-ups (speed of light can't change in m/s speed since metre's are defined by distance covered by light in a second and light is now defined as 297,xxx or 298,xxx m/s) while a second is set by the decay of an atom.\nAgain, the decay is actually predicted FROM the speed of light.\n\nNow if you ignore that part of it and basically say &quot;speed of light slowing&quot;, outside of the creationist circle and the theory put forward and supported by creationists (I see no other references on AiG and google returns a very slim set of actual hits).\nThe only proof I've seen is the red-shift *cough*proof*cough*.\n\nCan I also laugh at the fact all visible light is appearing is a roughly spherical ball AROUND US... Please, if all light travels at the same speed (and it does - whether that is constant through time or not) then of COURSE we'll be in a roughly spherical ball - anything outside that is still on it's way.\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]A ballon is actually the best model, I feel,[/quote:2k8v10rz]Why? Who says the expansion is uniform anyway?\nI can't honestly think of any 'best model' apart from a computer simulation or imagining in your mind the expansion of an object.\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]Who-ever said black holes rip holes in space-time?[/quote:2k8v10rz]I've heard of it as discussed like that - but I did put the term right after that (more specifically the mass)..\nIt distorts space-time so much that it has : [b]&quot;an infinite space-time curvature.&quot;[b].\nIt is an &quot;infinite mass'd, zero-volume, singularity.\nIt distorts space-time so much that AL time/space curve in towards it.\n\n... I call that &quot;a rip in space-time&quot; since anything travelling across that space instantly ceases to exist (ie, matter becomes mass with no volume and may or may not eventually leak out as thermal+extra radiation).\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]Light cannot escape because light bends around mass even though it has no mass[/quote:2k8v10rz]Incorrect (mass has a mass). Bending isn't such a nice word there IMO. Imagine light as a wave - or particle. It has energy, and a direction (no mass). Mass bends space-time. The direction of the light particle/wave follows space-time, if it is distorted, the wave/particle doesn't know any difference.\nOR, you can think of it as a gravitational pull (external force) action upon the wave/particle (except light has no mass so this is a slightly incorrect way to think about it) changing the initial direction until it collides with the singularity.\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]When you watch the sun set, the sun is actually 6 sun diameters below where you see it.[/quote:2k8v10rz]Longitude, latitude and time of the year please.\nThat does not apply to ALL of the worlds inhabitants. Maybe at the centre of the Earth.\nNot to mention that you're more talking about the TIME light takes to travel to us rather then bending round the Earth.\nAnd a Sun-diameter.. I'm sure that is wider then our Earth's circumference.. Do you mean from a standpoint of a person (however wide the sun is if you could look at it directly - I'm guessing one or two inches).\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]in fact, you'd see the land scape curve upwards away from you.[/quote:2k8v10rz]Is that the new polite way of saying someone's fat?\n&quot;Well, I'm not saying you're fat - but - if the world was flat the Earth would curve away from you..&quot;\n.. Surely, from a POV, the Earth would NOT curve... It would be flat... Until you reached the edge and then it would curve quite a lot until you realised it was the radial edge.\n\nI thought the Greek's calculated the circumference/radius of the Earth by the curvature of it - using the well stuff simply for calculation the distance of the sun from the Earth?\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]I'm not sure if they're moving or not though. I would assume they are folloing the same tragectory it was as a star.[/quote:2k8v10rz]And that's the problem see?\nAn object going through normal space time has a volume and directional force, it distorts space-time a little but continues to move through it.\nA singularity bends space-time so much that it has no volume and so infinite mass, meaning that the curves of space-time are curved infinitely towards it... Meaning surely it can't travel or else the curve of space-time isn't sufficient to be called &quot;infinite&quot;.\n(yes, I know I'm slightly simplifying the fact and there are multiple types of 'black holes')\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]They never told us what makes it have two extra nuetrons in the firt place though.[/quote:2k8v10rz]Sometimes proton's get knocked out, sometimes extra neutrons get put in.

I think I challenged &quot;you're saying it's not possible at all?&quot; which would mean you would have to NOT believe in evolution to confirm my comment..\nAlso notice that evolution IS a proven fact based on what humans have done (human-selected evolution of numerous plants and animals: peas, dogs, wheat, grass, hay, cattle, sheep, turnips, carrots, potatoes, the list goes on!) using it... It's more the &quot;natural selection-based evolution&quot; or perhaps the massive times based around this fact that creationists have issues with?\nSo even the creationists have to acknowledge the fact God didn't create everything as it stands today and that things have changed over the course of time... And that we have been playing God for much longer then GM stuff (don't really wish to bring this into the convo too much) since God allows us to choose our own actions and so change the animals/plants as we see fit (yes I know the subtle difference which is why I don't want GM coming into the convo).\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]Further, but more related to the galaxy bit, why aren't we crashing into the sun?[/quote:2k8v10rz]Physics 101. Mass, distance, and combined directional forces mean we are in 'freefall'... IE: we ARE falling towards the sun. Constantly, as are **all** 'Orbiting' objects.\nTheir orbits will eventually decay and crash into the objects they orbit - as can be seen around the universe (I'm sure there's gotta be some evidence somewhere other then small asteroids which probably won't satisfy your needs).\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]we aren't occasionally losing planets when they get too far from the sun or other planets aren't flying into the sun when they get too close.[/quote:2k8v10rz]By it's very definition, a planet is required to be an orbiting &quot;planetoid&quot; of a certain mass that goes round the/a solar-star (Sun).\nSaying that, even if it has been such a short period of time (let's say 10,000 years) - that's more then enough time for any extra planets to be removed (via throwing out into space preferably - since hitting the sun would be bad and wouldn't fit into 10,000 years).\nNow look up at the stars - at the very way THEIR star systems, THEIR supernova and planets are in different stages of creation (some forming planets still, others dying, again I may try and look for planets external to our system colliding/etc).\nOn EiG (evidence in genesis? ..) I read just now that the creation of the stars, with the light being created 99% of the way to the Earth is somehow &quot;misleading&quot; and as such, they have problems with it....\nNumber 1 - why? Since having evidence of evolution, and external evidence that planets and stars form in the exact same way everywhere except from 6000-years ago is in itself a misleading fallacy.\nNumber 2 - Why is that any WORSE then creating everything as it is (fallacy) and letting the light come to us in it's own time?\nOne simply means that light travels to the Earth faster.\nAnyway, why - if EiG is so prudent to rule out fallacies - should we treat the creation of other &quot;solar systems&quot; differently to our own?\n\nIt seems EiG and all creationist &quot;physicists&quot; seem to be forgetting the most major scientific part: that rules are universal.\nIf you see a rule which fits one - but not ALL things - then the rule needs refining..\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]why aren't galaxies spinning around one another as opposed to colliding?[/quote:2k8v10rz]I don't know if they can or can't actually - but that is sheer size. Billions or stars/systems manage to spin around in the shape of galaxies (still crashing into each other). The Earth is pelted by loads of space-rubbish, every single day.\nMost galaxies are flying apart - why would God do that instead of having them all rotate around the centre of the universe?\n\nBUT - getting back to your text just before that: Orbiting objects.\nPhysics 101: an object with a force will keep moving with that force until an external force changes it.\nSo, an object is flying PAST the sun, the sun effects it, pulls it slightly towards it. Object moves in a SLIGHTLY different path. Sun keeps effecting it, till the object has moved around the sun, where the combined forces mean the object moves further away from the sun (force X minus force Y can still mean X is larger then Y).\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]In some cases, probably not all,[/quote:2k8v10rz]OK, and here are numerous paradoxes in which the church can ONLY explain as &quot;we don't know&quot; or &quot;we have to keep faith&quot;.\nLet's start out with your sentence verbatim: that indicates 2 classes of people, which I don't like anyway. It implies the &quot;one rule for us, one rule for them&quot; which as I said earlier is just plain silly, and much more complex and improbable when compared against the &quot;simplest, one rule fits all&quot; solution.\n\nBUT, back to the paradoxes: God creates humans to have their own choice... But God creates people to be who they are, gives them their skills etc, so in fact he makes them who they are and so TAKES AWAY that &quot;free choice&quot; that they have supposedly got.\nGod &quot;allows&quot; bad things to happen. Indicating he has some sort of control, and he also gives you good things (in times of need, good fortunes, luck, miracles)... BUT he cannot control your life. That is a self denying rule (he does bad/good things for a reason - but also doesn't do them because then that would be controlling you).\nAnd personally, my favourite is the praise of God, and the fact that creating us to praise him and keep faith, but actuaaly giving us the choice to do so... Which means he's actually not bothered if we do or not - which means he couldn't have created us for praise (since he doesn't care - whether we praise or not)... If he does care (as before) then he wouldn't have given us the choice and as such controlled us.\n\nAll three only answerable by what I said before &quot;because he wants us to keep the faith&quot; (or some minor variant) or &quot;we can only guess at what he has planned&quot;.\n\n[quote:2k8v10rz]I could even agree that the critters were under sea first but the difference is how fast the events occurred. [/quote:2k8v10rz]So a creationist would rather have God:\nlying, bending time - but not bending time (or contributing to more of the lying), moving earth/etc, setting up our solar system exactly but none of the others, \nRather then believe that:\nGod created all matter (big bang), gave it rules by which to build itself in a timely manner (physics / quantum mech), and so built everything over time, and applied everything on a universal level.\n\n...

      "HTML": "OK, more:<br/><br/><blockquote><p>The speed of light is slowing down. Some guys got a PhD in proving it mathematically. It's a tiny amount like 0.00000001 scine the start of the universe or something like that. But it is slowing.</p></blockquote>No they haven't.<br/>A creationist physicist (if you can believe such an oxymoron) put forward some bizarro proof that the speed of light went from 303,000-&gt;300,000m/s from 1700-1800 (ish) and 300,000-&gt;298,xxx/s from 1850-&gt;2000 (again, ish)..<br/>Not to mention the various balls-ups (speed of light can't change in m/s speed since metre's are defined by distance covered by light in a second and light is now defined as 297,xxx or 298,xxx m/s) while a second is set by the decay of an atom.<br/>Again, the decay is actually predicted FROM the speed of light.<br/><br/>Now if you ignore that part of it and basically say &quot;speed of light slowing&quot;, outside of the creationist circle and the theory put forward and supported by creationists (I see no other references on AiG and google returns a very slim set of actual hits).<br/>The only proof I've seen is the red-shift *cough*proof*cough*.<br/><br/>Can I also laugh at the fact all visible light is appearing is a roughly spherical ball AROUND US... Please, if all light travels at the same speed (and it does - whether that is constant through time or not) then of COURSE we'll be in a roughly spherical ball - anything outside that is still on it's way.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>A ballon is actually the best model, I feel,</p></blockquote>Why? Who says the expansion is uniform anyway?<br/>I can't honestly think of any 'best model' apart from a computer simulation or imagining in your mind the expansion of an object.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Who-ever said black holes rip holes in space-time?</p></blockquote>I've heard of it as discussed like that - but I did put the term right after that (more specifically the mass)..<br/>It distorts space-time so much that it has : [b]&quot;an infinite space-time curvature.&quot;[b].<br/>It is an &quot;infinite mass'd, zero-volume, singularity.<br/>It distorts space-time so much that AL time/space curve in towards it.<br/><br/>... I call that &quot;a rip in space-time&quot; since anything travelling across that space instantly ceases to exist (ie, matter becomes mass with no volume and may or may not eventually leak out as thermal+extra radiation).<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Light cannot escape because light bends around mass even though it has no mass</p></blockquote>Incorrect (mass has a mass). Bending isn't such a nice word there IMO. Imagine light as a wave - or particle. It has energy, and a direction (no mass). Mass bends space-time. The direction of the light particle/wave follows space-time, if it is distorted, the wave/particle doesn't know any difference.<br/>OR, you can think of it as a gravitational pull (external force) action upon the wave/particle (except light has no mass so this is a slightly incorrect way to think about it) changing the initial direction until it collides with the singularity.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>When you watch the sun set, the sun is actually 6 sun diameters below where you see it.</p></blockquote>Longitude, latitude and time of the year please.<br/>That does not apply to ALL of the worlds inhabitants. Maybe at the centre of the Earth.<br/>Not to mention that you're more talking about the TIME light takes to travel to us rather then bending round the Earth.<br/>And a Sun-diameter.. I'm sure that is wider then our Earth's circumference.. Do you mean from a standpoint of a person (however wide the sun is if you could look at it directly - I'm guessing one or two inches).<br/><br/><blockquote><p>in fact, you'd see the land scape curve upwards away from you.</p></blockquote>Is that the new polite way of saying someone's fat?<br/>&quot;Well, I'm not saying you're fat - but - if the world was flat the Earth would curve away from you..&quot;<br/>.. Surely, from a POV, the Earth would NOT curve... It would be flat... Until you reached the edge and then it would curve quite a lot until you realised it was the radial edge.<br/><br/>I thought the Greek's calculated the circumference/radius of the Earth by the curvature of it - using the well stuff simply for calculation the distance of the sun from the Earth?<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I'm not sure if they're moving or not though. I would assume they are folloing the same tragectory it was as a star.</p></blockquote>And that's the problem see?<br/>An object going through normal space time has a volume and directional force, it distorts space-time a little but continues to move through it.<br/>A singularity bends space-time so much that it has no volume and so infinite mass, meaning that the curves of space-time are curved infinitely towards it... Meaning surely it can't travel or else the curve of space-time isn't sufficient to be called &quot;infinite&quot;.<br/>(yes, I know I'm slightly simplifying the fact and there are multiple types of 'black holes')<br/><br/><blockquote><p>They never told us what makes it have two extra nuetrons in the firt place though.</p></blockquote>Sometimes proton's get knocked out, sometimes extra neutrons get put in. It's been ages since I did it a A-level.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>&quot;hey check out that girls rack&quot;... and the other guy says, &quot;that sounds a bit TOO male.&quot;</p></blockquote>What girl? Where!?<br/><!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --><br/>... Yes it is. The guys who do that are so blind that they don't understand that it's the girl that counts, not how big her 18th century torture device is (yes yes, the only thing I could come up with).<br/><br/><blockquote><p>This is assuming I believed in evolution and life had to come from something.</p></blockquote>No it's not. I think I challenged &quot;you're saying it's not possible at all?&quot; which would mean you would have to NOT believe in evolution to confirm my comment..<br/>Also notice that evolution IS a proven fact based on what humans have done (human-selected evolution of numerous plants and animals: peas, dogs, wheat, grass, hay, cattle, sheep, turnips, carrots, potatoes, the list goes on!) using it... It's more the &quot;natural selection-based evolution&quot; or perhaps the massive times based around this fact that creationists have issues with?<br/>So even the creationists have to acknowledge the fact God didn't create everything as it stands today and that things have changed over the course of time... And that we have been playing God for much longer then GM stuff (don't really wish to bring this into the convo too much) since God allows us to choose our own actions and so change the animals/plants as we see fit (yes I know the subtle difference which is why I don't want GM coming into the convo).<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Further, but more related to the galaxy bit, why aren't we crashing into the sun?</p></blockquote>Physics 101. Mass, distance, and combined directional forces mean we are in 'freefall'... IE: we ARE falling towards the sun. Constantly, as are **all** 'Orbiting' objects.<br/>Their orbits will eventually decay and crash into the objects they orbit - as can be seen around the universe (I'm sure there's gotta be some evidence somewhere other then small asteroids which probably won't satisfy your needs).<br/><br/><blockquote><p>we aren't occasionally losing planets when they get too far from the sun or other planets aren't flying into the sun when they get too close.</p></blockquote>By it's very definition, a planet is required to be an orbiting &quot;planetoid&quot; of a certain mass that goes round the/a solar-star (Sun).<br/>Saying that, even if it has been such a short period of time (let's say 10,000 years) - that's more then enough time for any extra planets to be removed (via throwing out into space preferably - since hitting the sun would be bad and wouldn't fit into 10,000 years).<br/>Now look up at the stars - at the very way THEIR star systems, THEIR supernova and planets are in different stages of creation (some forming planets still, others dying, again I may try and look for planets external to our system colliding/etc).<br/>On EiG (evidence in genesis? ..) I read just now that the creation of the stars, with the light being created 99% of the way to the Earth is somehow &quot;misleading&quot; and as such, they have problems with it....<br/>Number 1 - why? Since having evidence of evolution, and external evidence that planets and stars form in the exact same way everywhere except from 6000-years ago is in itself a misleading fallacy.<br/>Number 2 - Why is that any WORSE then creating everything as it is (fallacy) and letting the light come to us in it's own time?<br/>One simply means that light travels to the Earth faster.<br/>Anyway, why - if EiG is so prudent to rule out fallacies - should we treat the creation of other &quot;solar systems&quot; differently to our own?<br/><br/>It seems EiG and all creationist &quot;physicists&quot; seem to be forgetting the most major scientific part: that rules are universal.<br/>If you see a rule which fits one - but not ALL things - then the rule needs refining..<br/><br/><blockquote><p>why aren't galaxies spinning around one another as opposed to colliding?</p></blockquote>I don't know if they can or can't actually - but that is sheer size. Billions or stars/systems manage to spin around in the shape of galaxies (still crashing into each other). The Earth is pelted by loads of space-rubbish, every single day.<br/>Most galaxies are flying apart - why would God do that instead of having them all rotate around the centre of the universe?<br/><br/>BUT - getting back to your text just before that: Orbiting objects.<br/>Physics 101: an object with a force will keep moving with that force until an external force changes it.<br/>So, an object is flying PAST the sun, the sun effects it, pulls it slightly towards it. Object moves in a SLIGHTLY different path. Sun keeps effecting it, till the object has moved around the sun, where the combined forces mean the object moves further away from the sun (force X minus force Y can still mean X is larger then Y).<br/><br/><blockquote><p>In some cases, probably not all,</p></blockquote>OK, and here are numerous paradoxes in which the church can ONLY explain as &quot;we don't know&quot; or &quot;we have to keep faith&quot;.<br/>Let's start out with your sentence verbatim: that indicates 2 classes of people, which I don't like anyway. It implies the &quot;one rule for us, one rule for them&quot; which as I said earlier is just plain silly, and much more complex and improbable when compared against the &quot;simplest, one rule fits all&quot; solution.<br/><br/>BUT, back to the paradoxes: God creates humans to have their own choice... But God creates people to be who they are, gives them their skills etc, so in fact he makes them who they are and so TAKES AWAY that &quot;free choice&quot; that they have supposedly got.<br/>God &quot;allows&quot; bad things to happen. Indicating he has some sort of control, and he also gives you good things (in times of need, good fortunes, luck, miracles)... BUT he cannot control your life. That is a self denying rule (he does bad/good things for a reason - but also doesn't do them because then that would be controlling you).<br/>And personally, my favourite is the praise of God, and the fact that creating us to praise him and keep faith, but actuaaly giving us the choice to do so... Which means he's actually not bothered if we do or not - which means he couldn't have created us for praise (since he doesn't care - whether we praise or not)... If he does care (as before) then he wouldn't have given us the choice and as such controlled us.<br/><br/>All three only answerable by what I said before &quot;because he wants us to keep the faith&quot; (or some minor variant) or &quot;we can only guess at what he has planned&quot;.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I could even agree that the critters were under sea first but the difference is how fast the events occurred. </p></blockquote>So a creationist would rather have God:<br/>lying, bending time - but not bending time (or contributing to more of the lying), moving earth/etc, setting up our solar system exactly but none of the others, <br/>Rather then believe that:<br/>God created all matter (big bang), gave it rules by which to build itself in a timely manner (physics / quantum mech), and so built everything over time, and applied everything on a universal level.<br/><br/>... And they criticize the scientific world for not following scientific practice?<br/><br/>I was going to say something about neadertal man - but it was gonna be totally opinionated saying &quot;I think-I think-I think&quot;.<br/>So I cut it.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>It was a quick reference in regards to the lava bit.</p></blockquote>I did take note of that.<br/>If you want reasons why I think EiG is rubbish then please do say so.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>*IF* the age of the rock itself is a few million years</p></blockquote>The only way to *prove* so is to test it, and the only way to test it is based on our physics work... We may come up with more full tests in the future.<br/>Again, it comes back to God lying to our faces - he knew our tests would be these and yet altered the carbon14 in the ground?<br/>I'm not going to say anymore on that because I don't know about ground carbon dating.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>I do that because the Bible says to in Malachi.</p></blockquote>But surely you've put more thought behind it?

If you are the object itself time does NOT slow, and you crash into the singularity at a speed approaching the speed of light.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>You miss understood me</p></blockquote>Nah, just a bit picky on words..<br/><br/><blockquote><p>With the sun set, as far as I know it doesn't matter where you are,</p></blockquote>In southern England for instance, during winter, the sun is very low in the sky wince the Earth is tilted with the north pole away from the sun - while during summer the sun barely 'dips' below the horizon as the north pole is tilted towards the sun.<br/>Therefore, the sun cannot be 6 suns below the horizon - possibly more of less depending on the time of year.<br/>This obviously must change depending on the location of the observer on the Earth's surface (more north? Then the winter months mean the sun is more than 6 suns below the horizon).<br/><br/>Or do you mean that the sun actually set a certain time ago (which I definitely can't see as being 6 'sun widths').<br/><br/><blockquote><p>If the earth was flat, the horizon would go up, you'd see the land keep going, curved upwards slightly (just as it curves downwards normally, stopping up seeing any further).</p></blockquote>That doesn't make sense,<br/>If you're on a sphere it curves down.<br/>If you're *IN* a sphere it curves up.<br/>... If you're on a PLANE (a flat disc) then.... by your non-explanation the world curves upwards to be inside a sphere.<br/><br/>On a spherical plane, where the observer is high in the sky, the disc is simply a circle - the horizon infront.<br/>As the observer get's closer to ground-level (let's say to the middle) the horizon get's further apart until you hit the floor - at which point the horizon is level with the Earth.<br/>I can find no logical proof for this.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>A singularity has a set mass, and a volume (volume is just really really small)</p></blockquote>....yes... ZERO.<br/><blockquote><p>the density can be considered near infinite though.</p></blockquote>That's because ANY mass in a space of nothing (zero) is an infinite density.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>many galaxies</p></blockquote>... Is the key word.<br/>They haven't been able to prove supermassive black holes yet as far as I know (since they can only detect it from what radiowaves are NOT sent out, or something similar).<br/>But even then, not all galaxies would have them - are those galaxies still or do they look like they're moving because our galaxy/solar system is moving?<br/><br/><blockquote><p>they did not add a leap second this year.</p></blockquote>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/07/oracle_leap_second/<br/>I've not heard of any cancellation.<br/><blockquote><p>yet it seems to suddenly stop 21st dec 2012</p></blockquote>That's like saying &quot;the binary system mystically stops at 65536 - which it doesn't.. Simply because 16-bit computing may use that, you can still extend it.<br/>Mayan's using the long-calendar (that's what they used to record their 52-year rotary combination of the 260-day and 365-day calendars.<br/>It's a base-20 system in the form of: number.number.number.number.number (actually is base: 20x20x20x18x20)<br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoameric ... t_calendar</a><!-- m --><br/>Some mayan text show dates well into the future.<br/>.. and the calendar (from what I've read there quickly) doesn't END on that date, but rather some predictions have been made concerning the 13'th whatever they call in.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>some planets/moon in our solar system have this already).</p></blockquote>Like what?<br/><blockquote><p>But if they start it, show them no mercy.

Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Its a much more intense struggle (and worthy cause) to reconcile conflicting feelings and thoughts about who God is, rather than just some logical theorem of weather God is or isn't. Otherwise, we distance ourselves from moving towards finding what real truth is, and these &quot;arguments&quot; are just a charade preventing us from really delving into hardcore answers about life and community.[/quote:243efykl]\nFinally, someone with a brain re-enters the forum... *sigh*.\n\nNow, Lyte - it seems you went more into the theology of God - for example, there *IS* a God for all of us, believers and non-believers. For children it's their mothers (I love the quote 'Mother is God, in the eyes of a child'), when some grow up it may be their heroes, hopes and dreams, aspirations, a loved one, a child.\n\nI see what you've basically put down is that &quot;God&quot; is basically whatever we believe in... Which I agree with...\nGod *CAN* be a bearded geezer in a white tux, with black tap-dancing shoes and a green fedora.\nOr he could be your good-luck charm.\nOr he could simply be the needed push in the right direction to get two people talking.\n\nI don't agree with another part of your posts (sorry can't get an exact quote):\n[quote:243efykl]The question isn't about whether a Christian God exists, but if he is good/evil.... thinking about whether he does or doesn't exist stops us getting real [b:243efykl](true)[/b:243efykl] answers for the meaning of life[/quote:243efykl]\nSo, with the first you're [i:243efykl]assuming[/i:243efykl] he does exist (ie: an assumption is when you take something as true without proof) - which, let's face it, is the whole point of belief.\nYou BELIEVE God is there without proof.. And let's face it, the Bible is like me telling you that I've seen alien's invading the back garden for the last 2 weeks - they are stories written down by MAN (the truth of these I'm not going to argue over).\n[i:243efykl]Side note: I now hate myself for writing &quot;let's face it&quot; twice.[/i:243efykl]\n\nYou're right that arguing over whether he exists is a tiny thing in the scope of everything else.\n*BUT* if you're a religious person, then you must regard God as your 'meaning of life', and that he has some idea that you won't grasp until the end (or when you're playing checkers with him)...

Its a much more intense struggle (and worthy cause) to reconcile conflicting feelings and thoughts about who God is, rather than just some logical theorem of weather God is or isn't. Otherwise, we distance ourselves from moving towards finding what real truth is, and these &quot;arguments&quot; are just a charade preventing us from really delving into hardcore answers about life and community.</p></blockquote><br/>Finally, someone with a brain re-enters the forum... *sigh*.<br/><br/>Now, Lyte - it seems you went more into the theology of God - for example, there *IS* a God for all of us, believers and non-believers. For children it's their mothers (I love the quote 'Mother is God, in the eyes of a child'), when some grow up it may be their heroes, hopes and dreams, aspirations, a loved one, a child.<br/><br/>I see what you've basically put down is that &quot;God&quot; is basically whatever we believe in... Which I agree with...<br/>God *CAN* be a bearded geezer in a white tux, with black tap-dancing shoes and a green fedora.<br/>Or he could be your good-luck charm.<br/>Or he could simply be the needed push in the right direction to get two people talking.<br/><br/>I don't agree with another part of your posts (sorry can't get an exact quote):<br/><blockquote><p>The question isn't about whether a Christian God exists, but if he is good/evil.... thinking about whether he does or doesn't exist stops us getting real <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(true)</span> answers for the meaning of life</p></blockquote><br/>So, with the first you're <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">assuming</span> he does exist (ie: an assumption is when you take something as true without proof) - which, let's face it, is the whole point of belief.<br/>You BELIEVE God is there without proof.. And let's face it, the Bible is like me telling you that I've seen alien's invading the back garden for the last 2 weeks - they are stories written down by MAN (the truth of these I'm not going to argue over).<br/><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Side note: I now hate myself for writing &quot;let's face it&quot; twice.</span><br/><br/>You're right that arguing over whether he exists is a tiny thing in the scope of everything else.<br/>*BUT* if you're a religious person, then you must regard God as your 'meaning of life', and that he has some idea that you won't grasp until the end (or when you're playing checkers with him)...

I do believe prayer is enough, and that God is capable of changing hearts.  We cannot help ourselves if sin or our sinful nature is obstructing our pursuit of truth.  I also do not find &quot;God helping those who help themselves&quot; to be a overtly biblical.  That's not to say its not true.   but Jesus often talks about coming to heal the sick, not those that think they are okay.  It is indeed impossible to &quot;fix&quot; things when your tools are broken.  If faith and trust is truly what God deems worthy in his eyes, yet the bible says that faith comes from the Lord, than God is most definitely our savior and the beginning of all redemptive things!  \n\nThis is what I find so fascinating of gospel.  If it is indeed true, than our wildest dreams have come true.  That a creator that is full of power and authority has made himself like us and engaged with us as the most intimate of friends, to love us, to die for us, to discipline us, to mentor us, to grant our desires; all with the purpose of wooing our hearts to him and enjoying his creation with him, becoming and entering all that we were meant to be.\n\nIf the gospel is a lie, it is a [i:3mt6u5yt]cruel[/i:3mt6u5yt] lie to shame and humiliate us, giving us hope where there is none really to have.\n\nI believe it is true.",

(i hope my tone doesn't come across mean or anything, i'm just curious.)<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>steve the gaming guy wrote:</cite><br/>So far, it sounds like lyteside is the closest to my outlook on God than anyone.  I appreciate your offer to pray for Elex and it couldn't matters to pray for anyone and everyone, there are just other things to remember.  The Bible does talk about praying to assist in matters but it also talks about God helping those who help themselves...</blockquote><br/><br/>thanks for the encouragement, Steve!  I do believe prayer is enough, and that God is capable of changing hearts.  We cannot help ourselves if sin or our sinful nature is obstructing our pursuit of truth.  I also do not find &quot;God helping those who help themselves&quot; to be a overtly biblical.  That's not to say its not true.   but Jesus often talks about coming to heal the sick, not those that think they are okay.  It is indeed impossible to &quot;fix&quot; things when your tools are broken.  If faith and trust is truly what God deems worthy in his eyes, yet the bible says that faith comes from the Lord, than God is most definitely our savior and the beginning of all redemptive things!  <br/><br/>This is what I find so fascinating of gospel.  If it is indeed true, than our wildest dreams have come true.  That a creator that is full of power and authority has made himself like us and engaged with us as the most intimate of friends, to love us, to die for us, to discipline us, to mentor us, to grant our desires; all with the purpose of wooing our hearts to him and enjoying his creation with him, becoming and entering all that we were meant to be.<br/><br/>If the gospel is a lie, it is a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">cruel</span> lie to shame and humiliate us, giving us hope where there is none really to have.<br/><br/>I believe it is true.",

God gave us the gift of free will.\nFact5: I donâ€™t fully understand your point here.  Are you saying that you already know everything you could possibly learn from any book?\nFact6: Men did build the church buildings for anyone who wishes to gather and praise God.\n\nI love God as a supernatural entity; I cannot love nature in that way.  Nature to me means rain, plant life, condensation, animals, etcâ€¦  That's just me.\n\nNowâ€¦ if I say I believe the Bible is true; that does not make it true.

      "HTML": "<blockquote><cite>Redsun wrote:</cite>no Idea why so many think we all sinned and need to repent etc.</blockquote><br/>I can answer that.  Romans 3:23 â€œFor all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God.â€  And Romans 6:23 â€œFor the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life.â€  So that answers why so many think we all have sinned (rom 3:23) and need to repent (rom 6:23)<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Redsun wrote:</cite><br/>Fact1: Men wrote the bibles not God<br/>Fact2: Men re-translated the bibles not god<br/>Fact3: Nature only intervenes in life when it's a matter of death and life nothing else(therefor we make our own choices)<br/>Fact4: The human brain is very good at making It's own decision without the help of a god(It's called Will)<br/>Fact5: no book should have to tell us what we should already know, this goes for the animal kingdom to(Nature imprints this already in our minds)<br/>Fact6: Churches are built by men not God<br/><br/>People need to realize that you can Love nature just as good as you love your god.</blockquote><br/><br/>I will respond to your facts in the same manner you have listed yours.<br/><br/>Fact1: Men wrote the Bible through inspiration of God.  II Timothy 3:16 â€œall scripture is written through the inspiration of God..â€<br/>Fact2: I donâ€™t have a problem with men translating the Bible.  Does re-translating have a different meaning for you in this case?  <br/>Fact3: Can you explain how nature only intervenes when itâ€™s a matter of death and life?<br/>Fact4: God made our intricately designed brains so we can think logically.  God gave us the gift of free will.<br/>Fact5: I donâ€™t fully understand your point here.  Are you saying that you already know everything you could possibly learn from any book?<br/>Fact6: Men did build the church buildings for anyone who wishes to gather and praise God.<br/><br/>I love God as a supernatural entity; I cannot love nature in that way.  Nature to me means rain, plant life, condensation, animals, etcâ€¦  That's just me.<br/><br/>Nowâ€¦ if I say I believe the Bible is true; that does not make it true.  But if it is true, then why shouldnâ€™t I try to learn more from it?<br/><br/><br/>Oh, I love the flood talks... I addressed it here and there earlier in this thread I think but I don't mind talking about it more.  I will click Submit for now though.  What questions do you have about the flood?",

But if you read these &quot;tales&quot;, they are written in a factual manner and not like a story.  There are parables that Jesus told in the Bible that makes it clear there is a lesson to be learned from them.  But other stories, say the ark, for example... what are we to learn from it if it's just a story?  There's no main message or punchline.  Where the parable that Jesus told about the prodigal son who took his father's money and left and spent it all and came back to his father who still loved him.... the point or message was that the father had unchanging love for his son regardless of his mistakes.

II Timothy 3:16 â€œall scripture is written through the inspiration of God..â€</blockquote> Does that relate to ALL scripture (including al those terrible movies and the very repulsive stuff - sadistic stuff which I don't wanna go into)?<br/>Doesn't this contradict our free will, since everything is 'inspired' by God?</p></blockquote><br/>Are you saying there are terrible movies that are considered scripture?  I never heard of it.  There are other references that talk about the only scripture is what is contained in the Bible so it is only referring to the Bible.  Everything is not inspired by God.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>[quote]Nowâ€¦ if I say I believe the Bible is true; that does not make it true. But if it is true, then why shouldnâ€™t I try to learn more from it?</p></blockquote>OO, now I do love this, because I get to ask this question:<br/>What stops you from learning from them even if they're LIES?[/quote]<br/>I suppose I could say that part of learning more from it is learning the truth of it.  I have not learned it be lies so far.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>What I'm kind of saying there, is that by itself, the bible should not be used as 100% accurate (just like many of the history books are not 100% accurate).<br/>*BUT* key events could be gathered (a mass exodus, a flood of some-sort, man ruining his 'eden' and creating a mud-ridden cess pool, etc) from it and other such scripture.</p></blockquote><br/>What I hear come up a lot is that the Bible is a book of tales or parables that are to be used as references and not to take literal.  But if you read these &quot;tales&quot;, they are written in a factual manner and not like a story.  There are parables that Jesus told in the Bible that makes it clear there is a lesson to be learned from them.  But other stories, say the ark, for example... what are we to learn from it if it's just a story?  There's no main message or punchline.  Where the parable that Jesus told about the prodigal son who took his father's money and left and spent it all and came back to his father who still loved him.... the point or message was that the father had unchanging love for his son regardless of his mistakes.  The parable itself may or may not have actually happened but Jesus telling the story did happen (biblically speaking).

He just takes it, because he can.  He loves us so much that he his wiling to take the hits.  He wants to woo us into relationship with him.  This is why he sent his son.

He works at trying to destroy evil while at the same redeeming people through patience.  What Thanatos hates is everything that God isn't and also working to fight against.  He doesn't destroy evil, he does one better; he turns it for good!  He takes what the enemy made for destruction, and makes it even better than before!

Hmm, sudden flash of omniscience and an ultra-being which is outside space-time came to mind there but I didn't think the bible said anything about that.\n..

As I said, there's nothing to stop believing in the more broader parts of that - a flood is written in more than the bible as well as leaving traces behind.\nWasn't this part of the old testament (revelations?), where God was vengeful and smote sinners? .. Again, I say &quot;wasn't it&quot; since who says God can never 'change'?\nIf so, wouldn't the key part of this message be &quot;God is all powerful, God has washed away many sinners and he's begun again to create a better world&quot; which can have many meanings.. The ability to start again, the fear of God, the awe of God, that God saved everything he created - meaning he obviously thought there was hope.\n.. A great many things can be taken from a story, true or false.\n\nIt goes back to Jesus telling the story.. You expect people YEARS afterwards to remember what one person wrote... PRECISELY?\nOr do you think there were people there writing down word for word exactly what was spoken?\nDo you think Adam started writing the bible as soon as he was created, and got the low-down from God, passing it down through the generations of &quot;begat's&quot; so as to be 100% written fact?\nDoesn't that sort of contradict the whole 'inspiration' thing?\n\nThese are all questions that people who take the bible [b:83ng8egi]literally[/b:83ng8egi] don't overthink in my opinion..\n.. I'd like to know what they *DO* think.. I'll have to hound my Jovie friend.\n\n[quote:83ng8egi]Yes I would believe that.[/quote:83ng8egi]Not to say that he wasn't without sin - I thought that the whole mantra of &quot;being  baptised&quot; washing away your sins?\nAnd the Church never wanted to let the bible go - they didn't even want it translated out of Latin due to the fact that EVERYONE could read it.\n..

Hmm, sudden flash of omniscience and an ultra-being which is outside space-time came to mind there but I didn't think the bible said anything about that.<br/>.. Brings to mind the question &quot;does God still exist as God? Is that why he's stopped giving us all these floods and plagues, etc?&quot;<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Are you saying there are terrible movies that are considered scripture?</p></blockquote>Oops, sorry - I took scripture in the general sense of &quot;writing&quot;. (hence the &quot;holy scripture&quot; and &quot;biblical scripture&quot;.... Otherwise it's the annoying 'holy holy writings'.. )<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Everything is not inspired by God.</p></blockquote>I wonder if anyone wants to pick that up at all?<br/><blockquote><p>But other stories, say the ark, for example... what are we to learn from it if it's just a story?</p></blockquote>&quot;Just a story&quot;? As I said, there's nothing to stop believing in the more broader parts of that - a flood is written in more than the bible as well as leaving traces behind.<br/>Wasn't this part of the old testament (revelations?), where God was vengeful and smote sinners? .. Again, I say &quot;wasn't it&quot; since who says God can never 'change'?<br/>If so, wouldn't the key part of this message be &quot;God is all powerful, God has washed away many sinners and he's begun again to create a better world&quot; which can have many meanings.. The ability to start again, the fear of God, the awe of God, that God saved everything he created - meaning he obviously thought there was hope.<br/>.. A great many things can be taken from a story, true or false.<br/><br/>It goes back to Jesus telling the story.. You expect people YEARS afterwards to remember what one person wrote... PRECISELY?<br/>Or do you think there were people there writing down word for word exactly what was spoken?<br/>Do you think Adam started writing the bible as soon as he was created, and got the low-down from God, passing it down through the generations of &quot;begat's&quot; so as to be 100% written fact?<br/>Doesn't that sort of contradict the whole 'inspiration' thing?<br/><br/>These are all questions that people who take the bible <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">literally</span> don't overthink in my opinion..<br/>.. I'd like to know what they *DO* think.. I'll have to hound my Jovie friend.<br/><br/><blockquote><p>Yes I would believe that.</p></blockquote>Not to say that he wasn't without sin - I thought that the whole mantra of &quot;being  baptised&quot; washing away your sins?<br/>And the Church never wanted to let the bible go - they didn't even want it translated out of Latin due to the fact that EVERYONE could read it.<br/>.. Sorry, some late-night BBC documentary flashback there.",

A gun didn't do anything wrong.<br/><br/>The Love of Money is really referring to those who spend all their efforts getting more and they never give to God or others... in my opinion.",

My praying typically looks like a conversation with God: hoping for things with him, arguing with him, complaining, asking for guidance, sharing dreams with him, laughing together etc. He answers in the form of scripture, through others, through common sense, through logic, through miraculous signs, through the convictions and tugs at my heart, and in a still, small voice that I am learning to discern.\n\n2. do you go to church? at least sometimes?\nI believe the &quot;church&quot; to be all of God's family and believers, just like it was written about in Acts (NT) .  This means whenever 2 or more believers get together, pray for each other, share what God is doing in our life, worship God together, help feed and care for the homeless, and listen to other's needs, this is doing church.  That all being said, I do sometimes go to the man-made institution of church, which is &quot;meeting every sunday to do X, Y, and Z.&quot;  This is a modern, limited model of church, but I do participate now and then.\n \n3. do you believe in God exactly as it is written in the bible?\nI think it would be impossible to know God exactly as it is written in the bible, because there are always contentions and disagreements.

It does not denote that something must be finite.  That goes back to my point of God being all powerful and indestructible, but that doesn't mean he can do all conceivable things, like make himself not exist, because then he wouldn't be all powerful and indestructible.\n\nBut the first section you wrote I might agree with.  The problem comes with the &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; analogy (good movie by the way, definitely rings of 'plumbline' truth ) is when two opposing fantasies or experiences contradict each other:\n\nIf for instance, in my afterlife I really love the RedSun and want to hang out with him all the days of my life in heaven, because that would make me happiest.  Now sometime in the future I do something to piss off RedSun so much that he can't stand to even think about me!  (oh noes! =( ) anyway, he imagines heaven to be a place without me.  So the dilemma is now, which one becomes the reality, they can't both be reality in the [i:9iqccf5t]same[/i:9iqccf5t] sense.  Its true that we could both experience what we [i:9iqccf5t]thought[/i:9iqccf5t] was real, but at least one of us would have to live in an illusion world.\n\nThis is resolved as soon as there is a third party, however, such as an uncaused cause or superior being, that governs the thoughts and experiences of others, because he/she/it knows how to orchestrate things like reconciliation, redemption, rebuilding, etc.  The same rings true with hell.  And this is all reflected and shadowed in our reality on earth.  Things exist, being created and/or governed by one person, and experienced in different ways by others.\n\nbtw, I do look to the bible for my guidance, but i certainly don't propose that I know all the intricacies of what hell will be, especially since even when Jesus talks about it, he uses language that in greek and jewish culture meant extremely different things then we understand it now.  Also, at times its unclear where words of &quot;symbolism&quot; and words of &quot;literalism&quot; are being used.  The line begins to blur, and I think that's the point.  The scriptures are trying to warn and instruct us, giving us imaginative language. not say &quot;this is how it is: A, B, C, blah blah blah&quot;  The ABC method of understanding scripture is very modern, starting during the enlightenment period (1300-1600 AD ish I believe?)  If we really want to understand how scripture is trying to define the afterlife (and our relationship with the Lord, for that matter) than dissecting scripture like a dead frog just ain't gonna work.",
