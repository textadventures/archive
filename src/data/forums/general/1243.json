The nose acts as a filter, and like every filter, it must be cleaned regularly.  I clean my nose regularly, it feels good, and I can breath through my nose better when I do.  It's said to be a very hygienic process, and eating your bogies can boost your immune system.  Now I don't often eat my bogies, they don't taste very nice...\n\nBut how many of you really clean your noses?",
