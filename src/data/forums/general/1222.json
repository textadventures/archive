Even though it's not an instruction manual, I suggest reading through it (a few times), until the basics make sense.  I'm still hung on using the editor (you can use progs such as notepad to cold-code).  Be careful though; the editor has some flaws you might stumble across, so don't get discouraged; rather see it as an opportunity to learn how to cold-code (since cold-coding diminishes any confusion in your programming the editor might inflict).  I'm still using flags and if-then statements to achieve most of my results, but more difficult aspects of the language become easier every step of the way.  Stick with it though, and I hope to play a game of yours in the future.\n\n- Witch",
