      "EditableText": "- Short descriptions that only tell me what I need to know. In other words don't right a whole paragraph describing a forest (I already know what forests look like).\r\n- 50/50 gambles with death. Fantasy elements. I don't so much mind a LotR type affair, but all this Twilight and 'races/species' with special powers leaves me cold.\r\n- Very minimalistic. Dark with a light font. I know the compass, inventory and commonly used command buttons are handy, but unless you go to town on them with some clever CSS to make them less ugly I'd prefer they weren't there at all. And I have a real pet hate for the way the command box looks.\r\n- Pass. Can't think of any. If you want something badly enough you could probably do it (within the program's capabilities) and at least visually you have complete and utter freedom to remove everything with CSS.",

The reason I'm building a Gamebook this time round (something I've always been reluctant to do) is because the prospect of not only creating a parser game with a whole new set of commands, but getting the players to adapt and understand it doesn't use the typical commands is just too daunting. I want to be able to accommodate EVERY conceivable command the player might type, but that's just not possible. Nothing frustrates me more in a TA than when I can't do something I know I should be able to, just because I'm not matching the wording exactly the way the designer did when they were making it. Until this is addressed there has to be something very special about the game to keep me playing beyond even the first room.",
