I admire the rebelliousness, actually envious, of his avatar's size: it's definitely not 80px by 80px; How did you get away with its length?\n\nZelimos, although I posted this remark in the Quest 4.0 forum, I'd like to congratulate you on a job well done on your &quot;quest centre&quot; website.  Now every newbie can feel more comfortable with creating a game.  The look of the site is catchy and the flow of the page is efficient and smooth.  And I see a humble quality in your personality evidenced by your approach to understanding in some of your posts/replies; this quality should be commended and nurtured.\n\nIn Daisy's first post to me, she asked how my game was coming along and when it would be finished.  I thank her for that.  It shows she has genuine interest in other people and people like feeling others are interested in them.\n\nSteve the Gaming Guy ROCKS!  He's simple and speaks it.  His sense of humor is easy going, and anyone can get along with that!  Steve never has a negative remark about anyone, and when it seems he could fall into a swirl of negativity, he backs away, and must think: &quot;Aw, no!  I'm not getting into that mess!&quot;  Is that what you're thinking Steve? In fact, I've been wondering where Steve has drifted off to; kinda missed his replies, but then I saw one just today.  Good to see you and your goofy goggles made it back to the forum.\n\n-Witch Wyzwurd",
