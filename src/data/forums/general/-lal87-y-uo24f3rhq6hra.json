I, as the \"Dungeon Master\", want to extract some data from them - part of this 'game' is to get them to specify their 5 best records, favourite film, etc and then at Christmas time, the winner will be given a DVD of the film, a CD of their records etc, courtesy of the company that I work for. So I am looking for guidance as to (1) how to/is it possible to gather the data required - so is there some input type akin to a Form where the data will be entered and (2) getting that data to me - either by email (preferred) or by saving to a cookie-style file on the website that I can download at my heart's content. Any guidance is much appreciated... Or have I chosen wrongly by deciding on Quest and should look to another production tool to use?",
