To try and keep things in order, I've just spent 10 minutes dragging various rooms into the rooms from which they exit. A quick test and I didn't detect any errors, but have I made a terrible mistake doing this, by changing the default way the game places the rooms in the tree?\n\nIf you look at this screengrab from my tree, you can see how all my apartment rooms are now within the starting room (bedroom). Before this, each room/exit was alone in the tree, making the tree very long. Is this okay?",
