PC, XBox 360, PS3, Wii, etc. etc....\n\nLately, I have been playing Left 4 Dead on XBOX 360 at my friend's house during lunchbreaks.  That is one crazy adrenaline packed game.  I play lots o' others too in my spare time (spare time - hahahaha)\nPortal was lots of fun.  Very challenging.\nI like all the adventure games from the old King's Quest games to the latest Nancy Drew craze.  Don't laugh.  They are fun and not just for girls.
