You can look at the other coding languages out there, to learn coding's basic structure and coding logic~mindset, but you're really just creating more work and confusion for yourself, because you'll have to switch over anyways to learning quest's language, and knowing another code language will cause you a lot of confusion, as you'll mix up stuff.\n\n1. Introduction to Quest and if~coding logic~mindset~thinking, object + attribute usage, and etc:\n\ntutorial ( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/tutorial/</a><!-- m --> ), to get used to quest's basics in general. Once you've gone through the entire tutorial, understanding quest's basics of how to do things in general, being able to work with the GUI~Editor, then go to #2\n\n2. Introduction to Quest's Coding and Coding in general:\n\nA. In the GUI~Editor, at the top bar, click on the notepaper-like button, between the 'play' and '?-help' buttons. This notepaper button is a toggle between the GUI~Editor mode and the Code View mode.\n\nAND~OR\n\nB. download and install ( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a><!-- m --> ), open up any (for now just your own game quest files) quest file (*.aslx), then at the top, click on 'languages' and then choose 'XML'\n\nyou can also use any text program~software too (but notepad++ is very useful, but it's not the only good one for coders, but I like it, as it's good enough for noobs like me with coding, hehe), such as: notepad, wordpad, (apple's equivalents), etc to open up your quest files in code.\n\nthese two (A and B) means~methods allows you to start getting familiar with quest's code, especially the GUI~Editor to Code View mode, as it's a 'rosetta stone' for you: do something in the GUI~Editor, then switch to the Code View mode, to see how it translates or converts into code, seeing how to do the same thing in code. slowly try to build up your knowledge of how to do the same things in code as you do in the GUI~Editor.\n\nfor an example:\n\ncreate a new game, go into code view mode, see and match up the default new game code with the GUI~Editor's default new game stuff.\n\nnow, in the GUI~Editor, give your room a description, then go into Code View mode, ro see how to give a room a description in code.\n\netc etc etc, slowly build up your code knowledge: as you see more and more code lines (especially matched up with how it is in the GUI~Editor), you start to learn the coding's structure~form~syntax~patterns\n\n3. Learning Quest's Code Training, Step by Step (let's use notepad++ for this):\n\nin a new notepad++ file, we need to save it as a quest game file, which is simply done by giving it the extension of: .aslx (let's name our file: code training.aslx)\n\nnow... as for the code itself (within the file)... hehe:\n\nquest reads code just as you read a book: (upper left to lower right: left to right, go down a line, left to right, etc etc etc), and also, it uses the same order as that of an outline format.\n\nlet's first tell quest that this is going to be a quest file, which is done by this game file 'tag' block:\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/asl.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... s/asl.html</a><!-- m -->\n\nELEMENTS are your main things in quest (you should recognize these from the GUI~Editor): Game, Verbs, Commands, Functions, Objects, Exits, Turnscripts, Timers, Types (Object Types), etc etc etc\n\nCoding has the same structure as the real world: we've got our reality split into physical things (matter) and actions~movement (energy~waves~forces), well so does coding too: physical things (ELEMENTS, Attributes, etc. Any thing that has the tags on it basically, lol) and actions~movement (scripting such as the code lines inside Verbs, Functions, Script Attributes, Turnscripts, Timers, and etc. Any thing that does NOT have the tags on it, basically, lol).\n\nhorizontally written: &lt;asl&gt;entire game code content&lt;/asl&gt;\n\nOR\n\nvertically written:\n\n[code:2m1xn6eq]&lt;asl&gt;\n  // entire game game content&#46; notice how this is indented, as the indenting tells quest that this stuff is held within the &lt;asl&gt;&lt;/asl&gt; tag block, which it must be so as our game code must be within our game file, lol\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:2m1xn6eq]\n\nwe're going to use vertical format as it's much easier for us noobs to work with, though for simple code lines, we use horizontal format (such as attribute code lines and etc). Programmers~Hackers use horizontal format, but we're not at that level yet, lol.\n\n------\n\nquiz time hehe:\n\nquestion: how do you tell quest that this is going to be a library file instead of a game file ???\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/library.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... brary.html</a><!-- m -->\n\nanswer:\n\n[code:2m1xn6eq]&lt;library&gt;\n&lt;/library&gt;[/code:2m1xn6eq]\n\nas for the library file's extension, it's the same as a game files: .aslx (such as: my library file.aslx)\n\n-----\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/scripts.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... ripts.html</a><!-- m -->\n\nby the way, the ' // ' is the command for writing comments (notes to yourself or others reading your code) in your code (though they need to be within a script block, otherwise they'll be erased by quest, but let's ignore this for now, as you need to learn to code first, to know what~where is a script block, lol)\n\n------\n\n'tags' in quest use the symbols~characters: ' &lt;&gt; ' (start of the tag block) and ' &lt;/&gt; ' (end of the tag block)\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/asl.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... s/asl.html</a><!-- m -->\n\n&lt;asl&gt; (start of the game file tag block)\n&lt;/asl&gt; (end of the game file tag block)\n\nthink of a tag block as a bucket, which has a limit of containment (the top of the bucket and the bottom of the bucket, lol), but with code, we instead use a start tag ' &lt;&gt; ' and an end tag ' &lt;/&gt; ', to tell quest where, using the bucket anology, the top of the bucket is and where the bottom of the bucket is, so that it can hold our code content within the bucket.\n\nso, right now we've got it telling quest that this file is a game file in code:\n\n[code:2m1xn6eq]&lt;asl&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:2m1xn6eq]\n\n---------\n\nnext, we've got to match up our game file quest version with the quest version of the quest engine that you downloaded and installed (quest.exe), which is done by adding an attribute INTO the game file tag ' &lt;asl&gt;&lt;/as&gt; ' itself, which is done by this (using the current quest version of '550' ):\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/asl.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... s/asl.html</a><!-- m -->\n\n[code:2m1xn6eq]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:2m1xn6eq]\n\ngame file tag string attribute name: version\ngame file tag string attribute value: &quot;550&quot;\n\nthe equals sets the connection of version to &quot;550&quot; : version=&quot;550&quot;\n\nthe quotes surrounding the 550 is required as this tells quest that this value is indeed a string value, which it must be as this is to be a string attribute.\n\n-------\n\nhowever, right now we've got no game engine core code, nor even what language (english, spanish, chinese, etc) will be used, so let's add these to our game file:\n\n(we need to add the language first, then the core code, as quest needs to know the language it is to use, before it can then read the core code in that specific language. Remember, computers are very stupid, the secret and curse of programming, lol)\n\n[code:2m1xn6eq]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:2m1xn6eq]\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/include.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... clude.html</a><!-- m -->\n\nthe ' &lt;include ref=&quot; *.aslx &quot; /&gt; ' code line gets the file (which is already in the proper folder location, but if you want to use library files, you got to make sure your library file is in the same location as your quest.exe or is it the core.aslx files, meh), which means it gets the contents of the file that it gets, thus automatically adding that content into your game (during game play it is loaded up, have you played games with mods for them? you click~add the mods you want, and they get loaded up, 'initialized', when you start a game).\n\nalso, this ' include ref ' code line has slightly different (shortened) start and end tags: ' &lt; ' (start) and ' /&gt; ' (end), than the normal: ' &lt;&gt; ' (start) and ' &lt;/&gt; ' (end)\n\nthe ' &lt;include ref=&quot;English.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' is written above the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;Core.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' because it will be read~used first, which it needs to be, before the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;Core.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' is read~used.\n\nalso, remember to indent your ' include ref ' code lines, as we need them to be held WITHIN~INSIDE the game file: &lt;asl&gt;&lt;/asl&gt;\n\nalso, the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;Core.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' needs to be at the SAME indenting as the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;English.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' as you can't have it be within the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;English.aslx&quot; /&gt;, they (English.aslx and Core.aslx) both must be within the game file: &lt;asl&gt;&lt;/asl&gt;\n\n--------\n\nnow, we need our special ' game ' Game Object, which holds your game's settings, so to add the tags for it:\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m -->\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/game.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... /game.html</a><!-- m -->\n\n[code:2m1xn6eq]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;code training&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:2m1xn6eq]\n\nyou should recognize+understand this game tag block now, as instead of adding the 'version=&quot;550&quot; attribute within the tag, we are instead adding a 'name' string attribute to the game block tag.\n\nagain, we want the 'game' Game Object to be WITHIN the game file, so have it at the SAME indenting as your 'include ref', and it must be below (after) your 'include ref' (below~after the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;core.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' ).\n\n-------\n\nnow, let's add some of those game settings:\n\n(create a new game using quest.exe, and look at it's code, do you understand those code lines attribute settings for the game tag block?)\n\nlet's first add our 'gameid' string attribute (this is why we needed to create a new game using the quest.exe to generate a game id which we'll copy and paste into your code training game file):\n\n(my game id is pasted from an old game file of mine, to use for an example here)\n\n[code:2m1xn6eq]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;code training&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;d83ba5bb-2e3c-4f31-80c9-3e88a2dc082c&lt;/gameid&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:2m1xn6eq]\n\nnotice how the 'gameid' is indented further, as we want~need it to be WITHIN our 'game' settings tag block, as the 'gameid' is a setting of our 'game' Game Object's settings, lol.\n\nwe'll get back to explaining its syntax later when we talk about Attributes, so for now, just remember its pattern~syntax. (not the value, as that's just a uniquely algorithm generated string pattern by the quest engine), but if interested:\n\n&lt;attr name=&quot;XXX&quot; type=&quot;Attribute Type&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/attr&gt;\n\nexamples (using my naming system, lol):\n\n&lt;attr name=&quot;strength_string&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;attr name=&quot;strength_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;attr name=&quot;strength_double&quot; type=&quot;double&quot;&gt;100.0&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;attr name=&quot;dead_boolean&quot;

' that you see in your default new game (created from quest.exe) code, as it's just your own organization of~for your edited versions of your game creation, but maybe we do, so let's jsut add it too, to be safe:\n\n[code:2m1xn6eq]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

This notepaper button is a toggle between the GUI~Editor mode and the Code View mode.<br/><br/>AND~OR<br/><br/>B. download and install ( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a><!-- m --> ), open up any (for now just your own game quest files) quest file (*.aslx), then at the top, click on 'languages' and then choose 'XML'<br/><br/>you can also use any text program~software too (but notepad++ is very useful, but it's not the only good one for coders, but I like it, as it's good enough for noobs like me with coding, hehe), such as: notepad, wordpad, (apple's equivalents), etc to open up your quest files in code.<br/><br/>these two (A and B) means~methods allows you to start getting familiar with quest's code, especially the GUI~Editor to Code View mode, as it's a 'rosetta stone' for you: do something in the GUI~Editor, then switch to the Code View mode, to see how it translates or converts into code, seeing how to do the same thing in code. slowly try to build up your knowledge of how to do the same things in code as you do in the GUI~Editor.<br/><br/>for an example:<br/><br/>create a new game, go into code view mode, see and match up the default new game code with the GUI~Editor's default new game stuff.<br/><br/>now, in the GUI~Editor, give your room a description, then go into Code View mode, ro see how to give a room a description in code.<br/><br/>etc etc etc, slowly build up your code knowledge: as you see more and more code lines (especially matched up with how it is in the GUI~Editor), you start to learn the coding's structure~form~syntax~patterns<br/><br/>3. Learning Quest's Code Training, Step by Step (let's use notepad++ for this):<br/><br/>in a new notepad++ file, we need to save it as a quest game file, which is simply done by giving it the extension of: .aslx (let's name our file: code training.aslx)<br/><br/>now... as for the code itself (within the file)... hehe:<br/><br/>quest reads code just as you read a book: (upper left to lower right: left to right, go down a line, left to right, etc etc etc), and also, it uses the same order as that of an outline format.<br/><br/>let's first tell quest that this is going to be a quest file, which is done by this game file 'tag' block:<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/asl.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... s/asl.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>ELEMENTS are your main things in quest (you should recognize these from the GUI~Editor): Game, Verbs, Commands, Functions, Objects, Exits, Turnscripts, Timers, Types (Object Types), etc etc etc<br/><br/>Coding has the same structure as the real world: we've got our reality split into physical things (matter) and actions~movement (energy~waves~forces), well so does coding too: physical things (ELEMENTS, Attributes, etc. Any thing that has the tags on it basically, lol) and actions~movement (scripting such as the code lines inside Verbs, Functions, Script Attributes, Turnscripts, Timers, and etc. Any thing that does NOT have the tags on it, basically, lol).<br/><br/>horizontally written: &lt;asl&gt;entire game code content&lt;/asl&gt;<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>vertically written:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl&gt;<br/>  // entire game game content&#46; notice how this is indented, as the indenting tells quest that this stuff is held within the &lt;asl&gt;&lt;/asl&gt; tag block, which it must be so as our game code must be within our game file, lol<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>we're going to use vertical format as it's much easier for us noobs to work with, though for simple code lines, we use horizontal format (such as attribute code lines and etc). Programmers~Hackers use horizontal format, but we're not at that level yet, lol.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>quiz time hehe:<br/><br/>question: how do you tell quest that this is going to be a library file instead of a game file ???<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/library.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... brary.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>answer:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;library&gt;<br/>&lt;/library&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>as for the library file's extension, it's the same as a game files: .aslx (such as: my library file.aslx)<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/scripts.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... ripts.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>by the way, the ' // ' is the command for writing comments (notes to yourself or others reading your code) in your code (though they need to be within a script block, otherwise they'll be erased by quest, but let's ignore this for now, as you need to learn to code first, to know what~where is a script block, lol)<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>'tags' in quest use the symbols~characters: ' &lt;&gt; ' (start of the tag block) and ' &lt;/&gt; ' (end of the tag block)<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/asl.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... s/asl.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>&lt;asl&gt; (start of the game file tag block)<br/>&lt;/asl&gt; (end of the game file tag block)<br/><br/>think of a tag block as a bucket, which has a limit of containment (the top of the bucket and the bottom of the bucket, lol), but with code, we instead use a start tag ' &lt;&gt; ' and an end tag ' &lt;/&gt; ', to tell quest where, using the bucket anology, the top of the bucket is and where the bottom of the bucket is, so that it can hold our code content within the bucket.<br/><br/>so, right now we've got it telling quest that this file is a game file in code:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>next, we've got to match up our game file quest version with the quest version of the quest engine that you downloaded and installed (quest.exe), which is done by adding an attribute INTO the game file tag ' &lt;asl&gt;&lt;/as&gt; ' itself, which is done by this (using the current quest version of '550' ):<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/asl.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... s/asl.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>game file tag string attribute name: version<br/>game file tag string attribute value: &quot;550&quot;<br/><br/>the equals sets the connection of version to &quot;550&quot; : version=&quot;550&quot;<br/><br/>the quotes surrounding the 550 is required as this tells quest that this value is indeed a string value, which it must be as this is to be a string attribute.<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>however, right now we've got no game engine core code, nor even what language (english, spanish, chinese, etc) will be used, so let's add these to our game file:<br/><br/>(we need to add the language first, then the core code, as quest needs to know the language it is to use, before it can then read the core code in that specific language. Remember, computers are very stupid, the secret and curse of programming, lol)<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/include.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... clude.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>the ' &lt;include ref=&quot; *.aslx &quot; /&gt; ' code line gets the file (which is already in the proper folder location, but if you want to use library files, you got to make sure your library file is in the same location as your quest.exe or is it the core.aslx files, meh), which means it gets the contents of the file that it gets, thus automatically adding that content into your game (during game play it is loaded up, have you played games with mods for them? you click~add the mods you want, and they get loaded up, 'initialized', when you start a game).<br/><br/>also, this ' include ref ' code line has slightly different (shortened) start and end tags: ' &lt; ' (start) and ' /&gt; ' (end), than the normal: ' &lt;&gt; ' (start) and ' &lt;/&gt; ' (end)<br/><br/>the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;English.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' is written above the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;Core.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' because it will be read~used first, which it needs to be, before the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;Core.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' is read~used.<br/><br/>also, remember to indent your ' include ref ' code lines, as we need them to be held WITHIN~INSIDE the game file: &lt;asl&gt;&lt;/asl&gt;<br/><br/>also, the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;Core.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' needs to be at the SAME indenting as the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;English.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' as you can't have it be within the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;English.aslx&quot; /&gt;, they (English.aslx and Core.aslx) both must be within the game file: &lt;asl&gt;&lt;/asl&gt;<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>now, we need our special ' game ' Game Object, which holds your game's settings, so to add the tags for it:<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/</a><!-- m --><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/game.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... /game.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;code training&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>you should recognize+understand this game tag block now, as instead of adding the 'version=&quot;550&quot; attribute within the tag, we are instead adding a 'name' string attribute to the game block tag.<br/><br/>again, we want the 'game' Game Object to be WITHIN the game file, so have it at the SAME indenting as your 'include ref', and it must be below (after) your 'include ref' (below~after the ' &lt;include ref=&quot;core.aslx&quot; /&gt; ' ).<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>now, let's add some of those game settings:<br/><br/>(create a new game using quest.exe, and look at it's code, do you understand those code lines attribute settings for the game tag block?)<br/><br/>let's first add our 'gameid' string attribute (this is why we needed to create a new game using the quest.exe to generate a game id which we'll copy and paste into your code training game file):<br/><br/>(my game id is pasted from an old game file of mine, to use for an example here)<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;code training&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;d83ba5bb-2e3c-4f31-80c9-3e88a2dc082c&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>notice how the 'gameid' is indented further, as we want~need it to be WITHIN our 'game' settings tag block, as the 'gameid' is a setting of our 'game' Game Object's settings, lol.<br/><br/>we'll get back to explaining its syntax later when we talk about Attributes, so for now, just remember its pattern~syntax. (not the value, as that's just a uniquely algorithm generated string pattern by the quest engine), but if interested:<br/><br/>&lt;attr name=&quot;XXX&quot; type=&quot;Attribute Type&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/attr&gt;<br/><br/>examples (using my naming system, lol):<br/><br/>&lt;attr name=&quot;strength_string&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;attr name=&quot;strength_integer&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;100&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;attr name=&quot;strength_double&quot; type=&quot;double&quot;&gt;100.0&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;attr name=&quot;dead_boolean&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;attr name=&quot;primary_colors_stringlist&quot; type=&quot;simplestringlist&quot;&gt;red;blue;yellow&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;attr name=&quot;toys_objectlist&quot; type=&quot;objectlist&quot;&gt;ball;doll;squirt gun&lt;/attr&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;attr name=&quot;fight&quot; type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>// scripting code lines<br/>&lt;/attr&gt;<br/><br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/>I don't think we really need to add the other attribute setting ' &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt; ' that you see in your default new game (created from quest.exe) code, as it's just your own organization of~for your edited versions of your game creation, but maybe we do, so let's jsut add it too, to be safe:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

/&gt; ', ' &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt; ', and ' inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt; ' are for the GUI~Editor, so you can work with these Objects in the GUI~Editor, hehe:<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/elements/editor.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/ ... ditor.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>These are Object Types ' &lt;type&gt;&lt;/type&gt;

do something in the GUI~Editor, then switch to the Code View mode, to see how it translates or converts into code, seeing how to do the same thing in code&#46; slowly try to build up your knowledge of how to do the same things in code as you do in the GUI~Editor&#46;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for an example&#58;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;create a new game, go into code view mode, see and match up the default new game code with the GUI~Editor's default new game stuff&#46;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, in the GUI~Editor, give your room a description, then go into Code View mode, ro see how to give a room a description in code&#46;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;etc etc etc, slowly build up your code knowledge&#58; as you see more and more code lines (especially matched up with how it is in the GUI~Editor), you start to learn the coding's structure~form~syntax~patterns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3&#46; Learning Quest's Code Training, Step by Step (let's use notepad++ for this)&#58;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in a new notepad++ file, we need to save it as a quest game file, which is simply done by giving it the extension of&#58;

Introduction to Quest's Coding and Coding in general&#58;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A&#46; In the GUI~Editor, at the top bar, click on the notepaper-like button, between the 'play' and '?-help' buttons&#46;

notepad, wordpad, (apple's equivalents), etc to open up your quest files in code&#46;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these two (A and B) means~methods allows you to start getting familiar with quest's code, especially the GUI~Editor to Code View mode, as it's a 'rosetta stone' for you&#58; do something in the GUI~Editor, then switch to the Code View mode, to see how it translates or converts into code, seeing how to do the same thing in code&#46; slowly try to build up your knowledge of how to do the same things in code as you do in the GUI~Editor&#46;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for an example&#58;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;create a new game, go into code view mode, see and match up the default new game code with the GUI~Editor's default new game stuff&#46;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, in the GUI~Editor, give your room a description, then go into Code View mode, ro see how to give a room a description in code&#46;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;etc etc etc, slowly build up your code knowledge&#58; as you see more and more code lines (especially matched up with how it is in the GUI~Editor), you start to learn the coding's structure~form~syntax~patterns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3&#46; Learning Quest's Code Training, Step by Step (let's use notepad++ for this)&#58;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in a new notepad++ file, we need to save it as a quest game file, which is simply done by giving it the extension of&#58;
