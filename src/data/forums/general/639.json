Tryed that but it only took off a few mbs think it was like 7mbs it took off still not small enough he said it would take the files and when you open the dos file it would start unpacking the files into the dir your in. Just dont know of a program anyone know here?",

Although I don't have one myself...\n\nI tried RAR with solid but saw basically 0 improvement in the files I rar'd, maybe 100k in an 8 meg group of files.... I think the extra 100k is better than risking losing alot of the files in the archive.",
