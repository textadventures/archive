Mention of transistors and other intricacies of the radio/television are not necessary unless they help the understanding.\r\n\r\n**How to simply explain analog vs digital transmission** as in radio or television signals.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it and a wholly over-simplified analog explanation:\r\nTransmitting\r\n1.  Sound waves are converted into electromagnetic waves that are coupled with a standard carrier wave.  \r\n2.  These \"message waves\" (original sound waves) can alter the carrier waves amplitude (AM radio) or the carrier waves frequency (FM radio).\r\n3.  This coupled wave is amplified prior to transmission as it travels up the transmitter's \"tower\" to increase range of signal.\r\nReceiving\r\n1.  When you turn on your radio and tune it to a specific radio station, electricity moves through your  antenna causing it to 'vibrate'.  \r\n2.  When the antenna is subjected to a resonant frequency/amplitude, the antenna transmits that specific wave frequency/amplitude into your radio.\r\n3.  The coupled message is then 'separated' into the sidebands (the carried message).  The radio 'selects' only vibrations with a specific range of frequencies (FM) or amplitudes (AM) within the bandwidth (sidebands x 2?).  This helps cancel out any interference from other waves.\r\n4.  The vibration is converted into small voltages that are outputted as the original sound message.\r\nDigital Transmission/Reception:\r\n1.  Pretty much the same process, but the information is not transmitted/received via one stream on one carrier wave.  It is sent as many, many packets of information coded into a stream of \"on's\" and \"off's\" (1's and 0's, aka binary code).  The radio/tv assembles the message and converts it back into sound/video.\r\n\r\nAnalog v Digitial - Digital ensures better reception as interference is limited due to numerous packets of info.  Assembling digitial transmission causes increased lag.\r\n\r\nAM v FM - AM has longer range due to increased amplitude.  FM has much wider variety because there is much more you can do with frequency than amplitude.  This is why AM typically sticks with talk radio and FM plays many more sounds (like music).  AM range increases at night when the ions in the ionosphere thin and acts as a \"rebounding mirror\".  AM also can travel along the curved space of the Earth as FM really does not.\r\n\r\nI've already run across the boat in the ocean analogy (rocking the boat = AM, waving your hand to create additional wave \"patterns\" = FM, and numbering hundred of ducks and letting a shore-man reassemble the ducks in the original pattern = analog).  This helps, but the process of modulation and reception is what I really get stuck on.\r\n\r\nThanks if anyone is interested.  8)",
