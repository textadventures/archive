Most of those games are popular because they spent months hyping their upcoming games on niche forums, brainstorming with their communities, and getting a sizeable group of initial players excited about the game before it was even out.

It's a disordered mess where the link to the latest version (by any of the 4 people who started doing their own, separate continuations when the original developer finished) are mixed in with people asking for help, suggestions for future versions, and fanart of the characters.

Discussing ideas with your fans, and answering people's criticism in a way that leads to conversation, is probably the best thing you can do.

If you are writing a game about fly fishing, it would be better to promote it on a fly fishing site, giving the link to the game itself.

That helps. If someone enjoys it and there is some randomness because you've broken away from the gamebook idea and allow players to truly chart their own path, then people who like it will play and play and play. Example - Sid Meyer's Pirates - just a simple sail and battle game, but you could go anywhere and choose to fight or not. Amazingly fun, and I played it many, many times.\r\n",
