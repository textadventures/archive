I have now got more spare time and me and a couple of mates thought we would try again.I started using Dark basic and got the routines for getting commands, splitting it into verbs and nouns,  using objects moving etc. When in the pub last night we were talking and this guy suggested we should try Quest. I have had a quick look at it and it looks pretty good.If we ever get any thing decent and polished I have seen you can put it out to android etc. does the program put a virtual keyboard up for the user to type with ? Also is the scripting language to use variables to control things and set up timers for other such things easyish and with a knowledge of dark basic / basic does this set you in good stead.And I know a good game is not written in a couple of weeks but still after a lot of hard work by us all and a long time is it still possible to earn a little beer money either by donations or selling ?\r\nCheers.\r\nPS is it better to download or use online or is there no difference ?",

Based on your post, I wouldn’t say you’re a Total Newbie.  :)\r\nThere is a learning curve for Quest, which I’m still climbing, but I had literally zero coding experience and I haven’t had any huge barriers.  Well, maybe I’ve had a couple, but the great folks here are awesome and have guided me through them.\r\n\r\nI’m guessing your curve will be far less steep than mine.\r\n\r\nWITHOUT A DOUBT, use the offline/downloaded version of Quest.  It’s infinitely better!",
