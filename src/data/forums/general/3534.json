Authors vote down criticism and even make fake accounts to promote their story with fake reviews and while pretending to be a supporter and satisfied customer of a product.\n\nHow do I know? ---- They used their real name (name in the game's author byline) in the fake account's yahoo email address that the person probably made just for this whole facade.\n\nIs this allowed?

I'm sure a quick look at the two user's IP addresses in the system might help (although that doesn't necessarily prove it wasn't a person's spouse, or prove that it wasn't a person making one account at work and one at home). \n\nIt just bugged me, because I've seen this several times before, and once before on this website. I can show the most blatant example, as I find it. But it was in a sandpile game where no one else replied, so I didn't complain because it didn't end up hurting anyone.",
