There is a bed in the SE corner and a night stand directly next to it. On the E wall there is a dresser with a window over it and in the SW corner a standing mirror. In the NW corner there is a rather large wardrobe. There is also the balcony to the S and your door to the N.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me I like to make it detailed.  But reading it I see all these cardinal directions that may confuse people.  Do I even need to describe what is in the room if it has no [I]real[/I] significance?  Would you assume there is a bed and a dresser and a night stand because it is a bedroom?  Would it matter to you the placement of it if I at least said those items are in the room?  Should I use terms like \"in front\", \"to your left\", \"on the right\", etc. so exits would not be caught up in all that?\r\n\r\nAnd what about this-\r\n\r\n[This is the Great Dining Hall of the castle. This is where you and your family, your Royal Guests and all those who live up stairs dine at. This room is very lavish. You and your parents, with the same sitting arrangements as in the throne room, sit closest to the E wall with their back to it in the middle with the Royal Guests next to either you or your father and then your Royal Family and then the rest generally filling up the table completely. You have waiters to serve those at the table and the finest of meals are prepared in the room to the N leading to the Kitchen. To the W is the Main Chambers where the throne room is at.]\r\n\r\nDoes half that even matter to you?  Should I cut most of that and just say a dining hall with a few servants rushing back and forth and that is it?\r\n\r\nAnd finally this-\r\n\r\n[This is the Horse Stables. This is where all the horses are kept and cared for. Each horse has it's own lodging with fresh straw for bedding and food and water. The horses each and every day get a decent work out of running and training and a good rub down with the brush to keep their coats shiny and dirt free. The hounds and other dogs are also kept here and cared for as well. To the South East is the Northern Courtyard and to the South the Black Smith's.]\r\n\r\nDoes one assume everyone knows what a horse stable is and what goes on or should go on there?  I like to give long descriptions, but I tend to over it do it some times.  What do you feel is the best course of action?",
