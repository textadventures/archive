It's not usually my type of music, and I'm never usually a lead singer, since I'm not all that great at it.\n\nHave a listen anyway, and tell me what you think.

When you sing the main verses, as the one guitar rhythm goes diga dig dig dig dig da digga dig dig, another track of a thick and distorted guitar holding power chords slightly louder than the track already recorded would add emphasis and pronounce the character of the lyrics.  But to achieve total effect, you're going to have to &quot;up&quot; your vocals in personality and emotion (I'm thinking voice like Nirvana, Bush, Disturbed, etc.).  A lot more rocking.  I can hear that you're aiming for this quality when you climb the pitch of your voice while repeating the same words as right before you go into the guitar solo.  It sounds to me that you're not getting enough air into your lungs and not pushing out hard enough with abdomen to gain volume and emphasis to stress the emotional character when you climb pitch; in fact, your voice slightly squeaks.  Your voice is also somewhat weak, it sounds like you sing through your nose at times, and sing at throat level, which are indicators of not allowing enough air into your lungs and/or pushing with your abdomen correctly.  This is why, to me, your softer songs, sound better, because you can get by by not having to utilize as much air or muscle.\n\nI like the songs.  But I believe &quot;Stood Up&quot; will rock harder once [i:1woelhir]you[/i:1woelhir] stand up and shout the song with unyielding certainty.  Aaaaaarggghhh!\nJust to give you a notion, a comparison, of the level of intensity the song is at now, I would say the overall aire of the tune is a notch below Creed's &quot;Higher&quot; (regardless of what one thinks of Creed) and a notch above Tom Petty's &quot;I Won't Back Down.&quot;  I feel the song, and would love to hear it rival Nirvana, Bush, or Fuel.  If you make it rock as hard as a Disturbed intensity, then I want a copy (not that I have any Disturbed albums... or Nirvana, Bush, or Fuel for that matter).\n\nIf I'm missing something, you're going to have to buy me a better laptop.\n\n\n-Witch",
