If it is getting five star reviews great, but even if your game is the best ever, that will take time. Before that, you need to get you game on the &quot;Latest&quot; list. And if you get your game beta-tested, that is not going to happen. You upload it as unlisted while it is beta-tested, then, a few weeks later, when the problems are ironed out, change it to be published.\n\nBut the web site considers its release date to be when you first uploaded it, and by the time it gets past moderation, it will buried five pages back in the list of latest releases, lost in a morass of untested Quest games and games written in other systems.\n\nSo do not get anyone else to test your game, just put it out there and hope; at least for a short while it will be on the front page, and people will play.",

I have set Deeper back to unlisted, and will upload again later as a &quot;new&quot; game.\n\nMy point here is to highlight an issue that  actively discourages beta-testing of Quest games. Anyone coming to the Text Adventures web site and looking at the latest releases will find a bunch of Quest games that are not beta-tested, and a bunch of games from other systems that probably are (because they will only come to this site once the game is satisfactory, and then, only if they think their game is half-way decent). They are then likely to conclude that the other systems are better for serous games.",
