I have more filled notebooks than I can count.  Some people have taken to planespotting but there is something about following the trains.\n\nIn my hometown we have quite an active railroad.  At least a few times per week I and a few friends go to an active part of the track near the yard and record numbers.  You would be surprised how many of the same engines pass through time and time again.  You get to know them, you know?  \n\nAfter the first 10 years or so it got so I knew which one was coming based on its horn or the sound.  Mainly with being familiar with the schedule, I'll admit.  Now it's second nature and I just wait to make sure the right engine comes on time.  Sometimes they will use a substitute engine but there have been times when I have known based on the sound of the train that the next one through would be a sub.\n\nWell, enough about that.  I'll probably get trashed for sharing a hobby here.  That's what happens, you know?  That movie, BTW, [u:xm09so4e]Trainspotting[/u:xm09so4e] had nothing to do with the hobby.  It was about a bunch of heroin-addicted Scots.  It was a good movie, but it really didn't address trainspotting to any degree.",
