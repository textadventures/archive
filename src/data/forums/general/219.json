Thinking about it in my point of view, it's pretty good being apart of the biggest thing in the world, the internet.  We are able to provide a game, or a community in which ANYBODY can play.  I've made a few good friends on the internet and some i could trust with my life.  So nerdy IS a good thing.<br/><br/>Sorry, had to lecture  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",
