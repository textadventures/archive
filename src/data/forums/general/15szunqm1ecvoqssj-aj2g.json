Still, I do a lot of JS and run the code through the functions one just to get them enabled in the engine so it figures that's what kills it.\r\n\r\nWhen you open a game which you already have a save for, it will look in a couple of special attributes. One of these contains all the text from last time. Another, `_transition`, contains a string which is `eval`ed to get a function which is then called.\r\n\r\nSo setting the attribute `_transition` to a string like `squiffy.story.sections['name of section'].js` will cause that section's JS to be run as soon as a saved game is loaded. You can use this to restore any JS functions and variables from a previous save.\r\nHowever, the transition attribute is clobbered by `squiffy.story.go`, so to make use of it you would need to override the save function with one that resets `_transition`, and also saves any JS variables that you want to preserve in a saved game.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, I believe I normally use something like this:\r\n```\r\n[[first section]]:\r\n    // This JS section will now run both  when starting a new game\r\n    //    *and* when resuming a saved game\r\n    //    so put any custom JS functions here\r\n\r\n    // modifying the save function:\r\n    squiffy.story.save = function () {\r\n        // This is what the default save function does, to save the text on screen:\r\n        squiffy.set('_output', squiffy.ui.output.html());\r\n        // This is added to make this JS run again when reloading:\r\n        squiffy.set('_transition', \"squiffy.story.sections['first section'].js\");\r\n\r\n        // If you want to preserve JS variables in a saved game,\r\n        //    put the code to save them in Squiffy attributes here\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    // We can test for the existence of _transition to check if the game has already saved\r\n    if (squiffy.get('_transition')) {\r\n        // If you have saved any JS variables into Squiffy attributes\r\n        //    code to load them back into JS variables goes here\r\n    } else {\r\n        // Code that you only want to run the first time goes here\r\n        // stuff like setting up JS variables, popups asking the player for their name, or whatever\r\n    }\r\n```",
