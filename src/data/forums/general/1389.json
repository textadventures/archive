I'm definite the 'white box' in the attic is down up backwards, and the internet cable should go in the back, split into two so you can have one cable going to the attic computer and one to the second router. I know basically what needs to be done, and vaguely how to do it, but I have never rewired internet cables before (though watch my dad set up this crazy system years ago).\n\nBasically I need advice/instructions on how to reverse the backwards white box in the attic, so both sets of computers are connected. I'd appriciate any help you can offer.",
