If that isn't bad enough (and it is), items need to be referred to by their full name and not just abbreviations - so \"x cargo contract\" works but \"x contract\" doesn't. Oh, and the \"v. battery\" needs to be typed like that - don't forget the full stop, kids, or it won't work. On top of that, we have room descriptions as good as \"you are in Forest\". A quality game and no mistake.\n\n[b:1te0b0n9]Operation: Sleepover[/b:1te0b0n9] was almost as impressive. There's a closed door but the \"open door\" command isn't understood - amazing bit of programming at work here. Several items are lying on the desk but none of them can be taken. And - best of all - the font is a horrible green colour! Oh, and not forgetting that for some reason that probably seemed like a good idea to the writer (but not to anyone else), he's buried the game away behind so many different sub-folders that half the time spent with this game will probably be finding it.\n\nThen I moved on to [b:1te0b0n9]Haunted Horror[/b:1te0b0n9] which begins its first location with the classic lines \"You are in the front Porch. There is Door here.\" Grammatically bad as [i:1te0b0n9]well[/i:1te0b0n9] as being poorly written. Examining your car when you're actually sat inside it reveals that \"I can't see that here\". There's a folder that can't be read but it can be opened. And... well, that's as far as I got before my will to live just vanished.\n\n\n\nIn all honesty, Alex, I think you'd have been better not uploading these games at all. Of the games I played, there's not one that's even playable. These things show Quest in a terrible light.\n\nMakes me shudder just thinking about how bad the games you turned down were...",
