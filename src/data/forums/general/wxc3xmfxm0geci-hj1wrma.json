Um, yeah....)</p>\n<p>ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW<br>\nLet's do the time-warp again.<br>\nLet's do the time-warp again.<br>\nNarrator:<br>\nIt's just a jump to the left.<br>\nAll:<br>\nAnd then a step to the right.<br>\nNarrator:<br>\nPut your hands on your hips.<br>\nAll:<br>\nYou bring your knees in tight.<br>\nBut it's the pelvic thrust<br>\nThat really drives you insane.<br>\nLet's do the time-warp again.<br>\nLet's do the time-warp again.</p>\n<p>Also, did you know that movie has a plot? You have to see it at least 4 times like I did, but it's there!<br>\nSpoilers<br>\nSo this couple, Brad and Janet, go to a friends' wedding. Then they drive home. Then a storm makes their car stop. So they stop at a mansion for help. Some crap happens as they spot Transelvanians, aliens from a different planet from a far off galaxy, doing a local dance,  \"The Time Warp\"! Then they meet Doctor Frankenfurter, who is insane. Doctor Frankenfurter builds a man. A gay song happens. Then Doctor Frankenfurter tries to sleep with Brad and Janet, but only Janet consents. Janet gets horney because Brad never made love to her. Brad goes insane. Some stuff happens. Then Frankenfurter traps/mind manipulates everyone to have an orgy in a swimming pool. Then 2 Transylvanian police show up, who were apparently working as spys, being Dr. F's servants, who arrest and kill Dr. Frankenfurter for rape and just all around being a pervert, even by Transylvanian standards. They also kill his man/monster. The mind manipulation thing is broken. Then Brad and Janet go out, and the entire mansion rockets away into OuterSpace, because apparently it's a rocket. Commence end credits.</p>\n\n",

However, this new world is nothing but an imitation of humankind’s motherland the Earth. But why were the colonies made in the first place? I hear the main purpose was technological development to improve the lives of human kind on Earth. Did human kind start asking too much from this imitation world? The self-sustained way of life is more stable than life on Earth especially since it lacks the risk of natural disasters.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that this unlimited growth was guaranteeing the eternal existence of human kind. Perhaps there was an age where people dreamed of the possibilities in the outer space; where they could start from scratch. However it’s unthinkable that the colonies or that humankind will ever forget the Earth.\r\n\r\nWhat did technological development in the colonies bring to the Earth? The kind of technology the Earth wants most: military power. Destruction is part of human nature that can never be gotten rid of; and now the colonies are developing a militaristic disposition. The colonies cannot forget the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Earth has great beauty. The animals known as humans have acquired such strength that they even think about controlling this planet for themselves. From the point of view of a planets life the life of a living thing lasts no more than an instant. But in the end, it is only themselves that humans can think of. Nothing changes. The time spent by humans in outer space has been a complete waste. The ideal is just a dream.\r\n\r\nThis false pacifism. This false living space. Outer space is nothing but a breeding ground for even more battles in the future. Wars throughout history have claimed many lives. Although human kind has never been able to forget the sorrow that has been caused by the wars, they have not stopped fighting. The blood and tears they shed in battle are merely ceremonial. One can’t speak of history without referring to the wars in each era as important events. I’m sure the pale pep talks of fighting for peace have been repeated numerous times in the past. The colonies say they need armaments to maintain peace. It’s no different from on Earth. The colonies think they have joined the big boys. I guess they believe that the bloodshed would lead to higher morale [to further unite the colonies.]\r\n\r\nSo why do people fight anyway?
