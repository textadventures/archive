You can progress through the game just the same, but instead of typing, you click on the panes at the right. Turn the command bar on, and it is a parser game, turn it off, and it is what?</p>\n<p>You could argue that the panes on the right are just sending commands to the parser, so even without the command bar, it is still a parser game, but it seems a grey area.</p>\n<p>How about listing the game engine (and differentiate between Quest TA and Gamebook)? That may have the added advantage that the data is already n the system, it just needs to be displayed and searchable.</p>\n\n",
