      "EditableText": "hey everyone.  My name is kyler... I'm a welder, 21 years old. I had some experience a few years back with C# on microsoft visual studio... used some programming book to help me program an astroid-like game.  I made it, hated programming, and shot my visual studio discs with a 12 gauge and deleted visual studio from my computer. I hate programming!\n\n   Haha well anyways I got an awesome idea for a game recently and figured that since it would take some massive team and years of work and probably millions of dollars to make it the way i wanted, and then maybe be popular for a couple years if it even made it, i'd make it as a text adventure instead... so i went to nonags.com to find a good text adventure game engine and this is what i found... and i'm hating this a hell of a lot less than pure programming.  In fact, I like it a lot.\n\n   So be on the look out for a text adventure like you have never experienced before... in maybe a year or two, cuz the wife doesn't like me on the computer every waking hour that I'm home and i've been working 12's and 14's for the past few months. lol",
