      "EditableText": "From the Non-Comp Review Project:\n\n\n\nAttempted Assassination by Matt Slotnick\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Baf's Guide\nAdditional links: SPAG's original copy of this review\nReviewed by Greg Boettcher\n\n[This review was previously published in SPAG #43. Reprinted with permission.]\n\nThis was the first Quest game I've ever played, and my goodness. I have to start by telling what I've observed about the Quest system before I go on to review the actual game.\n\nThe Quest System\n\nSome people might only barely consider Quest games to be interactive fiction. Although you can type in commands, the range of commands is extremely limited. From what I could tell, Quest is used mostly to make adventures that can be solved by using no verbs other than &quot;look at,&quot; &quot;examine,&quot; &quot;take,&quot; &quot;drop,&quot; &quot;speak to,&quot; &quot;give,&quot; the ever-popular &quot;use,&quot; and the directional verbs such as &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south.&quot; To input these verbs, you can type them in, but you can also input them via a graphical user interface on the right side of the game window. Also in that part of the screen there is also a list of nearly all the objects you can interact with. By clicking buttons and dragging various words, you can do 90% to 100% of everything you need to do to win a Quest game, without the need to type anything, and without the need to use any verbs not listed above.\n\nIn the game I played, I only found one case where a non-standard verb was implemented. In the case of one noun, it actually does work to type &quot;open noun.&quot; But this verb was implemented badly. If you try to &quot;open X&quot;, where X is almost any other noun, you get the same response as if you type &quot;asdf X&quot;.\n\nThus, it is not very rewarding to spend much time using non-standard verbs in Quest games. There is no illusion of being able to try to do anything you can think of to type. As such, I would expect most people to almost always use the click-and-drag interface on the right-hand side of the screen. This is IF at its most rudimentary; in fact, it is barely IF at all.\n\nAside from verb problems, there was also a tendency for noun problems, at least in the game I played. If you want to take a beach ball, for instance, &quot;get ball&quot; might not work; you might have to type &quot;get beach ball.&quot; Not very impressive.\n\nAs a result, the level of interaction in a Quest game is not adequate. At best, it feels like a graphical game with a clunky interface. But to me, having a trimmed-down interface without graphics is like having the thorn without the rose. And when it comes to interpreting textual input, Quest does a bad job.\n\nAttempted Assassination\n\nI keep thinking to myself that, to be fair, I should not ask whether Attempted Assassination is good, but whether it's good as a Quest game. On this basis, I have to ignore the game's shallow interactivity, bad parsing of verbs, bad parsing of nouns, clunky interface where almost all interactive objects are listed, etc. By Quest standards, is Attempted Assassination good?\n\nWell, the game begins when you wake up at 8:05, already late for work. You run to the car, arriving there at 8:08. There you find a note that says, &quot;Your car will detonate at 8:08 this morning. Have a nice day!&quot; So you hightail it out of there, seconds before the explosion. Then, later, you find out that the bomb was planted between 8:00 and about 8:02. My, but your guardian angel was quick at writing that note! Ah, the realism.\n\nIn another part of the game, you chase a suspicious man, who jumps through a window. You follow him until you have him cornered. Finally he says, &quot;I don't know of any bombing on your car. I jumped out of that window because I dropped my watch.&quot; How do you respond? You say, &quot;Oh, sorry to have bothered you then.&quot;\n\nThese cornball events might make you roll your eyes, or they might make you laugh. But even if there's some humor here, how are you supposed to enjoy it when the game is so sloppy and badly designed? The game contains rooms named &quot;room03&quot; and other such things; there are gruesome spelling and grammar mistakes (&quot;no where in side&quot; should be &quot;nowhere in sight&quot;); there is a car that you can't drive, but behaves for all the world like a door; and so on.\n\nNo, I can't call this game successful even by the standards of what Quest could achieve. And even if it was good as a Quest game, that would still make it pretty far from being a good game.\n\nOn the other hand, this was the author's first game. The good news is, there's plenty of room for improvement.\n\n\n\nESPER: The Secret of Drom Bennacht by Ian McDermott\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nConsidering this was the third Quest game I'd played in a row (and the previous two had been the worst games I'd played this year), I wasn't expecting much from ESPER: The Secret Of Drom Bennacht. But I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nYou're a psychic investigator called to the castle of Laird Jonathan Winters, a man who claims to have heard the cries of the Bean Sidhe, the mythological banshee. Only when you arrive at the castle, the Drom Bennacht of the game's title, it's to find Laird Winters brutally murdered and his father raving that the banshee is coming for him. No one else seems willing to try and solve the murder so that leaves just you...\n\nFor a Quest game, this is surprisingly well implemented. Most of the items mentioned in the room descriptions can be examined, NPCs can be spoken to (the dialogue is repeated each time you speak to them unfortunately) and the puzzles, while hardly inspiring, at least show promise. And the standard of the writing is well above average for a Quest game.\n\nBut just when I was thinking that this might actually be a decent game after all, it went and crashed on me. There's a record player in the music room that, when you try to examine it, produces an error message and crashes the game. Up to that point, I was quite enjoying ESPER. Oh well...\n\nAnother go at the game revealed a few things I'd missed the first time, but I also noticed that the further into the game I progressed, the less attention to detail there seemed to be. Whereas most of the items mentioned in the early room descriptions can be examined, a good number later in the game can't be, including one particularly one bad point where I was trapped underground in a three room corridor littered with items that couldn't be examined, taken or interacted with in any way, shape or form.\n\nConversation is handled via the &quot;talk to [name]&quot; format which produces a little dialogue box in the middle of the screen to choose your conversation options from. While this beats the guess the verb nightmare that is &quot;ask [name] about [subject]&quot;, it needs updating whenever the player discovers new information about something. I discovered the secret behind the banshee yet was unable to tell anyone about it. I was also unable to question people about things. Frustrating.\n\nOverall, ESPER is one of the better Quest games that I've played but unfortunately that's not really saying much. It's far better written than your average Quest game, has better puzzles and an actual storyline, but there are a good number of things about it that need fixing before it could ever be called a decent game.\n\n4 out of 10\n\n\n\nThe Former by DirkW\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nStraight off I ran into problems with this game. The first room description displays some text that keeps telling me I've just woken up â€“ shouldn't that have been part of the introduction and not an actual room description? A room description, after all, is supposed to describe what's in the room, and this one doesn't. I'm also advised to ask my Data Assistant (whatever that is) a series of questions but no matter what I typed, I couldn't get a response. For that matter, I couldn't even see my Data Assistant.\n\nThe game doesn't really seem to have any kind of storyline. You wake up on the floor of a factory unable to remember anything. That's about it. Most of the game â€“ that I managed to reach anyway â€“ involved wandering around the factory and solving such puzzles as figuring out the exact right wording for opening a locked desk with a key. (OPEN DESK doesn't work, nor does UNLOCK DESK or OPEN DESK WITH KEY or UNLOCK DESK WITH KEY. By the time I hit upon USE DESK KEY ON DESK I was just about ready to slit my throat.)\n\nElsewhere I found several locked doors but the game didn't even understand either the OPEN or UNLOCK commands. Sheesh. You'd think that out of all the commands a writer might think to implement in his game that OPEN would be one of them. But not here unfortunately.\n\nThere was very little text in the game but what bit there was seemed to be littered with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. There were also missing words, making some of the sentences jarring to read. Did the writer bother to read through his game before uploading it? I suspect not.\n\nMy total time spent playing this game was perhaps a little under twenty minutes, hence this fairly short review. But The Former, in its current state, is just about unplayable and twenty minutes was more than enough for me.\n\n1 out of 10\n\n\n\nHaunted Horror by Matt Slotnick\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nAnother Quest game that seems barely even finished: spelling mistakes in the intro, grammar errors and a general writing style that doesn't do the game any favours at all.\n\nYou're a detective who has received calls saying there are strange goings on at a house in the middle of nowhere so you've gone to investigate. Ho-hum. With enough depth, that might actually be a reasonably decent idea but here it's just given all the attention to detail of a quickly jotted down shopping list. It's also a remarkably similar idea to the intro to ESPER in which you're a detective called to investigate a castle in the middle of nowhere. It was done a lot better in ESPER.\n\nThe usual errors hit you right from the start: capitalisation where there doesn't need to be any; clunky room descriptions &quot;There is Door here&quot;; a folder which is described as being on the passenger seat of your car even after you've picked it up and dropped it in another location; a man described as &quot;the man who is in the house&quot;; a TV with the description &quot;a TV&quot;; and so little to do it's like the author just wrote a bunch of very empty locations, linked them together and then decided he was finished with the game and left it at that.\n\n&quot;What are you trying to do?&quot; pops up on screen every few moves in relation to something I've tried but which the program hasn't understood. WATCH TV isn't covered, nor is OPEN DOOR, nor is READ PAPER... Getting Quest to understand a simple command is often a trying experience.\n\nAs with just about every Quest game I've played, there are no hints and no walkthrough. I became stuck very soon and the lack of hints/walkthrough meant this game got pushed to one side pretty quickly indeed. With a better game I might have tried harder, but for Haunted Horror I was only too happy to see the back of it.\n\n1 out of 10\n\n\n\nKing's Quest V - The Text Adventure (Part 1 of 2) by Steve Lingle\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nThere were bits of King's Quest 5 â€“ a text adventure remake of the old classic â€“ that I really liked, and other bits that just had me climbing the walls in frustration.\n\nNow I'd never played King's Quest, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this game. I knew a bit about it: a generic fantasy quest populated with generic fantasy creatures in a generic fantasy world. All well and good. I've been a fan of that sort of thing. So enter King's Quest 5 which is as generic as you're likely to get.\n\nDescriptions tend to be short and to the point, but have a kind of retro charm about them that I liked. Playing this reminded me (nostalgically) of the text adventures I played as a teenager, back in the days before computer memories grew huge and you only had a few lines into which to cram as much descriptive text as possible. You don't get that sort of these very often these days which in some ways is a shame.\n\nThere are bits about the game, though, that just about had me tearing my hair out in frustration. From time to time, a message flashes up on screen advising you that you've just reached a particularly dangerous bit of the game and asks if you want to save your game. Now the first time I saw this, I thought &quot;hey, neat idea!&quot; as it stops the player unwittingly going and getting himself killed. But the message then flashed on screen every single time I went that way. And when I came back. Even if I went just east then west, I'd get the message asking me if I wanted to save the game. Twice. By the time I'd seen this for the tenth time, I had stopped thinking &quot;hey, neat idea!&quot; and started thinking &quot;*&amp;##@!!!&quot; (or words to that effect). Wouldn't it have been a better idea to just have this flash up on screen once? Or only a certain number of moves?\n\nThere are times when Quest makes you want to scream. Upon restoring a saved game, the introduction is displayed once again before jumping to the point you actually saved at. I don't know of any other system that does this and having to page through the text every time I died and then restored my saved game position (which was often as instant death lurks around many corners) was a major pain. Then, too, there's the annoyance of having to press F12 to repeat the previous command instead of the up arrow favoured by every other system. And don't get me started on the fact that you can only recall the previous command (and none of the ones before), and the lack of an undo feature...\n\nOverall, King's Quest 5 is probably the best Quest game ever written... unfortunately, considering the rest of the Quest games on offer, that's not saying much. Written with any other system, it would be lost amidst other, far better games. Some of the fault lies with the author (his save game warning wears thin after the first few times, and killing the player off as often as happens here is never going to go down well) but at least some of the faults lie with the system itself, and this game, more than any other, indicates that Quest, however many nice and fancy features it has, just isn't up to the task of producing a truly great game. Even in the hands of an above average writer, its flaws are apparent to anyone using it for more than a few minutes.\n\n4 out of 10\n\n\n\nThe Last Detective by Catalin\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nThe first thing I noticed about The Detective is its truly awful colour scheme. Here we have miniscule red text on a glaring bright blue background. Ouch. Is the writer colour blind? Unfortunately one of Quest's many failings is that it doesn't allow the player to alter the colour scheme so this is something you're stuck with. (Although there's an option from the Debug bar at the top of the screen to change the colour, it doesn't work.)\n\nAfter squinting at the screen for a while, my eyes just about managed to pick out the first few lines. Oh dear.\n\n    YOU ARE IN OFFICE.\n\n    THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE HELL OF A DAY. WITH ALL OF THESE PAPERWORKS TO DO. THERE WAS SOME KIND OF QUESTIONAIRE AS WELL. WHAT SHOULD I DO?\n\nSpelling and grammar errors in the very first thing the player sees? Never a good idea. Not to mention the prose switching from present to past tense, then back to present again. What follows after that was some kind of questionnaire based on the Harry Potter books. (What does any of this have to do with being a detective? Beats me.) As I've never read the Harry Potter books, I guessed at the answers, got them wrong, and the game ended. But, determined to at least give the game a fair go, I restarted, got the 'questionaire' wrong again, tried a third time... and made it. Woo-hoo! Onto the game proper...\n\nOr in theory anyway. Only there doesn't really seem to be a proper game here. The first room description I see after the questionnaire has finished simply reads YOU ARE IN LOUNGE. There's nothing else listed so presumably there's nothing in the lounge. Even exits. A few lines of badly written dialogue flash by on screen, at the end of which I'm given a couple of options in CYOA format to progress the game. If, that is, you can be bothered to play this game for much longer. I couldn't.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with The Detective that this review would probably be five times as long if I attempted to list them all. But in short: spelling mistakes; grammatical errors; terrible colour display (seriously, it's painful on the eyes); no kind of logic; no storyline; the location staying the same even when you've moved somewhere else (when you're in the location OUTSIDE FACILITY, you can jump in the back of a van and then climb into the front seat, and still you're said to be OUTSIDE FACILITY when you type look); and so on...\n\nOne best avoided.\n\n1 out of 10\n\n\n\nThe Lazy Gun Cult by Felic Roman\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nThere are times when playing The Lazy Gun Cult that I just felt like screaming. It's not the worst text adventure game I've every played, but it certainly misses out so many things that just about every other game I've ever played includes. Examples? There are doors that cannot be opened because the 'open' command hasn't been implemented. There's a door which I'm informed I can't open because it's locked, but â€“ guess what? â€“ the 'unlock' command hasn't been implemented. There's a button in another room. Now, what do you do when you find a button? You push it. Only not here apparently because the 'push' command hasn't been implemented. Are there are any basic commands Quest understands beyond compass directions and 'get', 'drop' and 'examine'? A few maybe, but good luck on finding them.\n\nStill want to play the game after reading all that? Then read on...\n\nYou're a private investigator specialising in paranormal cases. You receive an anonymous call telling you to check out an old mansion where cult rituals are taking place. So, armed with not a single item at all, you set off to investigate it. And promptly find yourself locked in the mansion because, as sheer bad luck would have it, the door closed behind you and now you can't get out. (Probably not the worst introduction I've ever read but not much to write home about. Where's the depth? The setting of the scene? And am I expected to believe that my detective just decided to venture to this mansion in the middle of nowhere because a source told him there were cult rituals being enacted there?)\n\nThe Lazy Gun Cult wasn't quite as bad as some of the other Quest games I decided to review for the Non-Comp Review Project 2005, but it had so many things wrong with it that I'd be hard pressed to recommend it to anyone. Aside from the unimplemented commands, there are problems with the way items appeared in the room descriptions. You'll often see things like:\n\n    There is a small plinth pillar here.\n    a cask of oil\n\nOr:\n\n    You can enter the venting tube system via a hole in the wall to your north, and an open trapdoor in the floor creates an exit down.\n    a bottle, a metal feather and A drawer in the desk.\n\nSurely it wouldn't take a lot of effort to produce something better than &quot;a bottle, a metal feather and a drawer in the desk&quot;? I mean, this is a game I'm supposed to play and enjoy and the writer hasn't even bothered fixing the room descriptions so the items in it display properly.\n\nWhile I didn't discover any hideous game-crashing bugs in The Lazy Gun Cult, I quickly found myself getting peeved off with it on the whole. The sheer amount of commands that should have worked but didn't made getting anywhere a struggle. There were the usual flaws that seem to bog down most Quest games â€“ lack of background, remarkably poor standard of writing, typos, grammatical errors, items that can't be examined even when you're looking right at them â€“ and in the end it wasn't a hard decision to give up playing and try something else instead.\n\n2 out of 10\n\n\n\nOperation: Sleepover by Justin Bailey\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nWhile unusual for a Quest game in that there were no hideous errors in it (at least in the bits that I saw), Operation: Sleepover wasn't much fun to play.\n\nIt starts with, of all things, your sister's fairy (or faery as it's spelt here) guardian showing up and telling you not to interrupt the sleepover she and her friends are having. To make sure you don't, she then magically locks the door to your bedroom. (Not a very good magical lock, as it happens, because examining a nearby book tells you how to get it open. Only don't try reading the book because the READ command isn't recognised...)\n\nAfter that, you're free to explore a not very interesting house and do... not much really. Most of the rooms have descriptions that are little more than a line long and there's no sense of depth in any of the locations. A typical description:\n\n    You are in the Downstairs Hallway.\n\n    You can go south, east or west.\n\n    The laundry room is to the west, the party is to the east.\n\nOr:\n\n    You are in the Bathroom.\n\n    There is a toilet, the bath tub and a mirror here.\n\n    You can go south.\n\nWhile there's no need to have room descriptions that stretch for pages, a bit more than YOU ARE IN THE BATHROOM followed by a shopping list of what's in the bathroom would be nice.\n\nWhile more technically accomplished than most Quest games I've played (i.e. no hideous errors, no crashes without warning), there's very little about Operation: Sleepover that I could find to recommend. There's not even much in the way of gameplay to get your teeth stuck into, and with no hints, and no real indication of what you're supposed to be doing, it wasn't long before I was yearning to try something else instead.\n\n3 out of 10\n\n\n\nStar Wars: Escape from Dagobah by David Leavitt\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nAh, good old Star Wars. I was always a fan of the films as a kid but less enamoured with the newer ones. If a really great text adventure was 'A New Hope' or 'The Empire Strikes Back', then this one would firmly be in the territory of 'The Phantom Menace'. Which isn't to say that it's a terrible game by Quest standards. By Quest standards it's actually not bad. Judged by the standards of any other system, though...\n\nThe background is brief and to the point: you're delivering a cargo to the aid of Princess Leia but the freighter you're on crash lands on the surface of the planet Dagobah. As sheer good luck would have it, you have survived whereas everyone else died. Betcha didn't see that one coming.\n\nEscape From Dagobah highlights some of the best and worst of Quest. On the positive side, the room descriptions are pretty decent. Nothing particularly special and unlikely to win awards for style, but adequate for the job in hand. On the negative side, the author hasn't taken the time to override the Quest default and so every room description you see has a few lines appended to it that have all the depth of a shopping list. Kinda kills the atmosphere. So you might have:\n\n    You are in Forest.\n\n    There is Sharp Rock here.\n\n    You can go north, south, west or up.\n\n    The trees are old, with rocks and shrubbery situated in an arranged pattern around the trunks. There is a tall sharp rock pointing to the air. Some trees look as though they can be climbed.\n\nThe actual description of the room isn't bad, but why oh why not override the default so it doesn't list YOU ARE IN FOREST right at the start? And Quest's annoying habit of capitalising item names doesn't help matters much either.\n\nElsewhere, the game's shortcomings are more apparent. One location advises me there are trees that can be climbed but the CLIMB command doesn't work. There are items that can clearly be read â€“ a note from Yoda and a list of the crew â€“ but READ doesn't work. There are items â€“ a vine being one of them â€“ that can't be picked up. There are enemies that can't be attacked â€“ or at least KILL, ATTACK, SHOOT, FIGHT and HIT don't work.\n\nFifteen minutes into the game and I was aching to quit. Like I said at the start of this review, for a Quest game this isn't bad, but that still doesn't make it any good.\n\n3 out of 10\n\n\n\nThree Worlds by Zach Kelly\nPlatform: Quest\nDownload: Quest Site\nAdditional links: Quest Site discussion\nReviewed by David Whyld\n\nSometimes you play a game and you know â€“ you just know â€“ right from the very start that you're not going to like it. Three Worlds was one such game.\n\nWhat's it about? Er... good question. There's no introduction at all. The game just starts with this wonderful description: YOU ARE IN EARTH. Ouch. The very first line in the game and already there's a grammatical error. Can it get any worse?\n\nOh yes.\n\nItems are mentioned in the room descriptions of Three Worlds but they can seldom be examined. The first location lists &quot;the Earth&quot;, &quot;a magnificent stairway&quot;, &quot;some clouds&quot; and &quot;a stairway of brimstone&quot;, but obviously these aren't considered important enough by the author to warrant even the most basic description.\n\nWandering around a little, I came across Heaven's Gate and St Peter. The Gate can't be opened â€“ the program doesn't even understand the command! â€“ and examining it merely informs me that if I use something as a lever I might be able to break the gates (that's 'gates' plural there whereas in fact there's only one gate mentioned previously). Elsewhere I found a golden sword just lying on the ground which, remarkably enough, was still listed in the room description even after I'd taken it and dropped it in another location. If all of that wasn't bad enough, and it was, the layout of the game is seriously messed up. Going south then north doesn't always lead you back to the same location. That might be deliberate but something tells me it was more likely as a result of careless programming.\n\nBy this stage, it was pretty obvious that Three Worlds wasn't going to be a game that I was likely to enjoy. So when I died a minute or so later â€“ killed by Satan himself (complete with a terrible piece of spoken dialogue which repeated itself for no good reason) â€“ I was ready to quit anyway. Incidentally, the game crashed when I died and I had to exit out of the programme to try it again.\n\nAll in all, Three Worlds is one of the worst games I've ever played and if this is anything of an indication of the overall quality of the games written with Quest, then it's poor reputation is well deserved.\n\n1 out of 10",

On this basis, I have to ignore the game's shallow interactivity, bad parsing of verbs, bad parsing of nouns, clunky interface where almost all interactive objects are listed, etc. By Quest standards, is Attempted Assassination good?<br/><br/>Well, the game begins when you wake up at 8:05, already late for work. You run to the car, arriving there at 8:08. There you find a note that says, &quot;Your car will detonate at 8:08 this morning. Have a nice day!&quot; So you hightail it out of there, seconds before the explosion. Then, later, you find out that the bomb was planted between 8:00 and about 8:02. My, but your guardian angel was quick at writing that note! Ah, the realism.<br/><br/>In another part of the game, you chase a suspicious man, who jumps through a window. You follow him until you have him cornered. Finally he says, &quot;I don't know of any bombing on your car. I jumped out of that window because I dropped my watch.&quot; How do you respond? You say, &quot;Oh, sorry to have bothered you then.&quot;<br/><br/>These cornball events might make you roll your eyes, or they might make you laugh. But even if there's some humor here, how are you supposed to enjoy it when the game is so sloppy and badly designed? The game contains rooms named &quot;room03&quot; and other such things; there are gruesome spelling and grammar mistakes (&quot;no where in side&quot; should be &quot;nowhere in sight&quot;); there is a car that you can't drive, but behaves for all the world like a door; and so on.<br/><br/>No, I can't call this game successful even by the standards of what Quest could achieve. And even if it was good as a Quest game, that would still make it pretty far from being a good game.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this was the author's first game. The good news is, there's plenty of room for improvement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ESPER: The Secret of Drom Bennacht by Ian McDermott<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>Considering this was the third Quest game I'd played in a row (and the previous two had been the worst games I'd played this year), I wasn't expecting much from ESPER: The Secret Of Drom Bennacht. But I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>You're a psychic investigator called to the castle of Laird Jonathan Winters, a man who claims to have heard the cries of the Bean Sidhe, the mythological banshee. Only when you arrive at the castle, the Drom Bennacht of the game's title, it's to find Laird Winters brutally murdered and his father raving that the banshee is coming for him. No one else seems willing to try and solve the murder so that leaves just you...<br/><br/>For a Quest game, this is surprisingly well implemented. Most of the items mentioned in the room descriptions can be examined, NPCs can be spoken to (the dialogue is repeated each time you speak to them unfortunately) and the puzzles, while hardly inspiring, at least show promise. And the standard of the writing is well above average for a Quest game.<br/><br/>But just when I was thinking that this might actually be a decent game after all, it went and crashed on me. There's a record player in the music room that, when you try to examine it, produces an error message and crashes the game. Up to that point, I was quite enjoying ESPER. Oh well...<br/><br/>Another go at the game revealed a few things I'd missed the first time, but I also noticed that the further into the game I progressed, the less attention to detail there seemed to be. Whereas most of the items mentioned in the early room descriptions can be examined, a good number later in the game can't be, including one particularly one bad point where I was trapped underground in a three room corridor littered with items that couldn't be examined, taken or interacted with in any way, shape or form.<br/><br/>Conversation is handled via the &quot;talk to [name]&quot; format which produces a little dialogue box in the middle of the screen to choose your conversation options from. While this beats the guess the verb nightmare that is &quot;ask [name] about [subject]&quot;, it needs updating whenever the player discovers new information about something. I discovered the secret behind the banshee yet was unable to tell anyone about it. I was also unable to question people about things. Frustrating.<br/><br/>Overall, ESPER is one of the better Quest games that I've played but unfortunately that's not really saying much. It's far better written than your average Quest game, has better puzzles and an actual storyline, but there are a good number of things about it that need fixing before it could ever be called a decent game.<br/><br/>4 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Former by DirkW<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>Straight off I ran into problems with this game. The first room description displays some text that keeps telling me I've just woken up â€“ shouldn't that have been part of the introduction and not an actual room description? A room description, after all, is supposed to describe what's in the room, and this one doesn't. I'm also advised to ask my Data Assistant (whatever that is) a series of questions but no matter what I typed, I couldn't get a response. For that matter, I couldn't even see my Data Assistant.<br/><br/>The game doesn't really seem to have any kind of storyline. You wake up on the floor of a factory unable to remember anything. That's about it. Most of the game â€“ that I managed to reach anyway â€“ involved wandering around the factory and solving such puzzles as figuring out the exact right wording for opening a locked desk with a key. (OPEN DESK doesn't work, nor does UNLOCK DESK or OPEN DESK WITH KEY or UNLOCK DESK WITH KEY. By the time I hit upon USE DESK KEY ON DESK I was just about ready to slit my throat.)<br/><br/>Elsewhere I found several locked doors but the game didn't even understand either the OPEN or UNLOCK commands. Sheesh. You'd think that out of all the commands a writer might think to implement in his game that OPEN would be one of them. But not here unfortunately.<br/><br/>There was very little text in the game but what bit there was seemed to be littered with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. There were also missing words, making some of the sentences jarring to read. Did the writer bother to read through his game before uploading it? I suspect not.<br/><br/>My total time spent playing this game was perhaps a little under twenty minutes, hence this fairly short review. But The Former, in its current state, is just about unplayable and twenty minutes was more than enough for me.<br/><br/>1 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>Haunted Horror by Matt Slotnick<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>Another Quest game that seems barely even finished: spelling mistakes in the intro, grammar errors and a general writing style that doesn't do the game any favours at all.<br/><br/>You're a detective who has received calls saying there are strange goings on at a house in the middle of nowhere so you've gone to investigate. Ho-hum. With enough depth, that might actually be a reasonably decent idea but here it's just given all the attention to detail of a quickly jotted down shopping list. It's also a remarkably similar idea to the intro to ESPER in which you're a detective called to investigate a castle in the middle of nowhere. It was done a lot better in ESPER.<br/><br/>The usual errors hit you right from the start: capitalisation where there doesn't need to be any; clunky room descriptions &quot;There is Door here&quot;; a folder which is described as being on the passenger seat of your car even after you've picked it up and dropped it in another location; a man described as &quot;the man who is in the house&quot;; a TV with the description &quot;a TV&quot;; and so little to do it's like the author just wrote a bunch of very empty locations, linked them together and then decided he was finished with the game and left it at that.<br/><br/>&quot;What are you trying to do?&quot; pops up on screen every few moves in relation to something I've tried but which the program hasn't understood. WATCH TV isn't covered, nor is OPEN DOOR, nor is READ PAPER... Getting Quest to understand a simple command is often a trying experience.<br/><br/>As with just about every Quest game I've played, there are no hints and no walkthrough. I became stuck very soon and the lack of hints/walkthrough meant this game got pushed to one side pretty quickly indeed. With a better game I might have tried harder, but for Haunted Horror I was only too happy to see the back of it.<br/><br/>1 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>King's Quest V - The Text Adventure (Part 1 of 2) by Steve Lingle<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>There were bits of King's Quest 5 â€“ a text adventure remake of the old classic â€“ that I really liked, and other bits that just had me climbing the walls in frustration.<br/><br/>Now I'd never played King's Quest, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this game. I knew a bit about it: a generic fantasy quest populated with generic fantasy creatures in a generic fantasy world. All well and good. I've been a fan of that sort of thing. So enter King's Quest 5 which is as generic as you're likely to get.<br/><br/>Descriptions tend to be short and to the point, but have a kind of retro charm about them that I liked. Playing this reminded me (nostalgically) of the text adventures I played as a teenager, back in the days before computer memories grew huge and you only had a few lines into which to cram as much descriptive text as possible. You don't get that sort of these very often these days which in some ways is a shame.<br/><br/>There are bits about the game, though, that just about had me tearing my hair out in frustration. From time to time, a message flashes up on screen advising you that you've just reached a particularly dangerous bit of the game and asks if you want to save your game. Now the first time I saw this, I thought &quot;hey, neat idea!&quot; as it stops the player unwittingly going and getting himself killed. But the message then flashed on screen every single time I went that way. And when I came back. Even if I went just east then west, I'd get the message asking me if I wanted to save the game. Twice. By the time I'd seen this for the tenth time, I had stopped thinking &quot;hey, neat idea!&quot; and started thinking &quot;*&amp;##@!!!&quot; (or words to that effect). Wouldn't it have been a better idea to just have this flash up on screen once? Or only a certain number of moves?<br/><br/>There are times when Quest makes you want to scream. Upon restoring a saved game, the introduction is displayed once again before jumping to the point you actually saved at. I don't know of any other system that does this and having to page through the text every time I died and then restored my saved game position (which was often as instant death lurks around many corners) was a major pain. Then, too, there's the annoyance of having to press F12 to repeat the previous command instead of the up arrow favoured by every other system. And don't get me started on the fact that you can only recall the previous command (and none of the ones before), and the lack of an undo feature...<br/><br/>Overall, King's Quest 5 is probably the best Quest game ever written... unfortunately, considering the rest of the Quest games on offer, that's not saying much. Written with any other system, it would be lost amidst other, far better games. Some of the fault lies with the author (his save game warning wears thin after the first few times, and killing the player off as often as happens here is never going to go down well) but at least some of the faults lie with the system itself, and this game, more than any other, indicates that Quest, however many nice and fancy features it has, just isn't up to the task of producing a truly great game. Even in the hands of an above average writer, its flaws are apparent to anyone using it for more than a few minutes.<br/><br/>4 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Last Detective by Catalin<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about The Detective is its truly awful colour scheme. Here we have miniscule red text on a glaring bright blue background. Ouch. Is the writer colour blind? Unfortunately one of Quest's many failings is that it doesn't allow the player to alter the colour scheme so this is something you're stuck with. (Although there's an option from the Debug bar at the top of the screen to change the colour, it doesn't work.)<br/><br/>After squinting at the screen for a while, my eyes just about managed to pick out the first few lines. Oh dear.<br/><br/>    YOU ARE IN OFFICE.<br/><br/>    THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE HELL OF A DAY. WITH ALL OF THESE PAPERWORKS TO DO. THERE WAS SOME KIND OF QUESTIONAIRE AS WELL. WHAT SHOULD I DO?<br/><br/>Spelling and grammar errors in the very first thing the player sees? Never a good idea. Not to mention the prose switching from present to past tense, then back to present again. What follows after that was some kind of questionnaire based on the Harry Potter books. (What does any of this have to do with being a detective? Beats me.) As I've never read the Harry Potter books, I guessed at the answers, got them wrong, and the game ended. But, determined to at least give the game a fair go, I restarted, got the 'questionaire' wrong again, tried a third time... and made it. Woo-hoo! Onto the game proper...<br/><br/>Or in theory anyway. Only there doesn't really seem to be a proper game here. The first room description I see after the questionnaire has finished simply reads YOU ARE IN LOUNGE. There's nothing else listed so presumably there's nothing in the lounge. Even exits. A few lines of badly written dialogue flash by on screen, at the end of which I'm given a couple of options in CYOA format to progress the game. If, that is, you can be bothered to play this game for much longer. I couldn't.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with The Detective that this review would probably be five times as long if I attempted to list them all. But in short: spelling mistakes; grammatical errors; terrible colour display (seriously, it's painful on the eyes); no kind of logic; no storyline; the location staying the same even when you've moved somewhere else (when you're in the location OUTSIDE FACILITY, you can jump in the back of a van and then climb into the front seat, and still you're said to be OUTSIDE FACILITY when you type look); and so on...<br/><br/>One best avoided.<br/><br/>1 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Lazy Gun Cult by Felic Roman<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>There are times when playing The Lazy Gun Cult that I just felt like screaming. It's not the worst text adventure game I've every played, but it certainly misses out so many things that just about every other game I've ever played includes. Examples? There are doors that cannot be opened because the 'open' command hasn't been implemented. There's a door which I'm informed I can't open because it's locked, but â€“ guess what? â€“ the 'unlock' command hasn't been implemented. There's a button in another room. Now, what do you do when you find a button? You push it. Only not here apparently because the 'push' command hasn't been implemented. Are there are any basic commands Quest understands beyond compass directions and 'get', 'drop' and 'examine'? A few maybe, but good luck on finding them.<br/><br/>Still want to play the game after reading all that? Then read on...<br/><br/>You're a private investigator specialising in paranormal cases. You receive an anonymous call telling you to check out an old mansion where cult rituals are taking place. So, armed with not a single item at all, you set off to investigate it. And promptly find yourself locked in the mansion because, as sheer bad luck would have it, the door closed behind you and now you can't get out. (Probably not the worst introduction I've ever read but not much to write home about. Where's the depth? The setting of the scene? And am I expected to believe that my detective just decided to venture to this mansion in the middle of nowhere because a source told him there were cult rituals being enacted there?)<br/><br/>The Lazy Gun Cult wasn't quite as bad as some of the other Quest games I decided to review for the Non-Comp Review Project 2005, but it had so many things wrong with it that I'd be hard pressed to recommend it to anyone. Aside from the unimplemented commands, there are problems with the way items appeared in the room descriptions. You'll often see things like:<br/><br/>    There is a small plinth pillar here.<br/>    a cask of oil<br/><br/>Or:<br/><br/>    You can enter the venting tube system via a hole in the wall to your north, and an open trapdoor in the floor creates an exit down.<br/>    a bottle, a metal feather and A drawer in the desk.<br/><br/>Surely it wouldn't take a lot of effort to produce something better than &quot;a bottle, a metal feather and a drawer in the desk&quot;? I mean, this is a game I'm supposed to play and enjoy and the writer hasn't even bothered fixing the room descriptions so the items in it display properly.<br/><br/>While I didn't discover any hideous game-crashing bugs in The Lazy Gun Cult, I quickly found myself getting peeved off with it on the whole. The sheer amount of commands that should have worked but didn't made getting anywhere a struggle. There were the usual flaws that seem to bog down most Quest games â€“ lack of background, remarkably poor standard of writing, typos, grammatical errors, items that can't be examined even when you're looking right at them â€“ and in the end it wasn't a hard decision to give up playing and try something else instead.<br/><br/>2 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>Operation: Sleepover by Justin Bailey<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>While unusual for a Quest game in that there were no hideous errors in it (at least in the bits that I saw), Operation: Sleepover wasn't much fun to play.<br/><br/>It starts with, of all things, your sister's fairy (or faery as it's spelt here) guardian showing up and telling you not to interrupt the sleepover she and her friends are having. To make sure you don't, she then magically locks the door to your bedroom. (Not a very good magical lock, as it happens, because examining a nearby book tells you how to get it open. Only don't try reading the book because the READ command isn't recognised...)<br/><br/>After that, you're free to explore a not very interesting house and do... not much really. Most of the rooms have descriptions that are little more than a line long and there's no sense of depth in any of the locations. A typical description:<br/><br/>    You are in the Downstairs Hallway.<br/><br/>    You can go south, east or west.<br/><br/>    The laundry room is to the west, the party is to the east.<br/><br/>Or:<br/><br/>    You are in the Bathroom.<br/><br/>    There is a toilet, the bath tub and a mirror here.<br/><br/>    You can go south.<br/><br/>While there's no need to have room descriptions that stretch for pages, a bit more than YOU ARE IN THE BATHROOM followed by a shopping list of what's in the bathroom would be nice.<br/><br/>While more technically accomplished than most Quest games I've played (i.e. no hideous errors, no crashes without warning), there's very little about Operation: Sleepover that I could find to recommend. There's not even much in the way of gameplay to get your teeth stuck into, and with no hints, and no real indication of what you're supposed to be doing, it wasn't long before I was yearning to try something else instead.<br/><br/>3 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>Star Wars: Escape from Dagobah by David Leavitt<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>Ah, good old Star Wars. I was always a fan of the films as a kid but less enamoured with the newer ones. If a really great text adventure was 'A New Hope' or 'The Empire Strikes Back', then this one would firmly be in the territory of 'The Phantom Menace'. Which isn't to say that it's a terrible game by Quest standards. By Quest standards it's actually not bad. Judged by the standards of any other system, though...<br/><br/>The background is brief and to the point: you're delivering a cargo to the aid of Princess Leia but the freighter you're on crash lands on the surface of the planet Dagobah. As sheer good luck would have it, you have survived whereas everyone else died. Betcha didn't see that one coming.<br/><br/>Escape From Dagobah highlights some of the best and worst of Quest. On the positive side, the room descriptions are pretty decent. Nothing particularly special and unlikely to win awards for style, but adequate for the job in hand. On the negative side, the author hasn't taken the time to override the Quest default and so every room description you see has a few lines appended to it that have all the depth of a shopping list. Kinda kills the atmosphere. So you might have:<br/><br/>    You are in Forest.<br/><br/>    There is Sharp Rock here.<br/><br/>    You can go north, south, west or up.<br/><br/>    The trees are old, with rocks and shrubbery situated in an arranged pattern around the trunks. There is a tall sharp rock pointing to the air. Some trees look as though they can be climbed.<br/><br/>The actual description of the room isn't bad, but why oh why not override the default so it doesn't list YOU ARE IN FOREST right at the start? And Quest's annoying habit of capitalising item names doesn't help matters much either.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the game's shortcomings are more apparent. One location advises me there are trees that can be climbed but the CLIMB command doesn't work. There are items that can clearly be read â€“ a note from Yoda and a list of the crew â€“ but READ doesn't work. There are items â€“ a vine being one of them â€“ that can't be picked up. There are enemies that can't be attacked â€“ or at least KILL, ATTACK, SHOOT, FIGHT and HIT don't work.<br/><br/>Fifteen minutes into the game and I was aching to quit. Like I said at the start of this review, for a Quest game this isn't bad, but that still doesn't make it any good.<br/><br/>3 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>Three Worlds by Zach Kelly<br/>Platform: Quest<br/>Download: Quest Site<br/>Additional links: Quest Site discussion<br/>Reviewed by David Whyld<br/><br/>Sometimes you play a game and you know â€“ you just know â€“ right from the very start that you're not going to like it. Three Worlds was one such game.<br/><br/>What's it about? Er... good question. There's no introduction at all. The game just starts with this wonderful description: YOU ARE IN EARTH. Ouch. The very first line in the game and already there's a grammatical error. Can it get any worse?<br/><br/>Oh yes.<br/><br/>Items are mentioned in the room descriptions of Three Worlds but they can seldom be examined. The first location lists &quot;the Earth&quot;, &quot;a magnificent stairway&quot;, &quot;some clouds&quot; and &quot;a stairway of brimstone&quot;, but obviously these aren't considered important enough by the author to warrant even the most basic description.<br/><br/>Wandering around a little, I came across Heaven's Gate and St Peter. The Gate can't be opened â€“ the program doesn't even understand the command! â€“ and examining it merely informs me that if I use something as a lever I might be able to break the gates (that's 'gates' plural there whereas in fact there's only one gate mentioned previously). Elsewhere I found a golden sword just lying on the ground which, remarkably enough, was still listed in the room description even after I'd taken it and dropped it in another location. If all of that wasn't bad enough, and it was, the layout of the game is seriously messed up. Going south then north doesn't always lead you back to the same location. That might be deliberate but something tells me it was more likely as a result of careless programming.<br/><br/>By this stage, it was pretty obvious that Three Worlds wasn't going to be a game that I was likely to enjoy. So when I died a minute or so later â€“ killed by Satan himself (complete with a terrible piece of spoken dialogue which repeated itself for no good reason) â€“ I was ready to quit anyway. Incidentally, the game crashed when I died and I had to exit out of the programme to try it again.<br/><br/>All in all, Three Worlds is one of the worst games I've ever played and if this is anything of an indication of the overall quality of the games written with Quest, then it's poor reputation is well deserved.<br/><br/>1 out of 10",
