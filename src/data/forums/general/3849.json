To my surprise, it is in it's published form, [u:3t1hygdw]90 kilobytes[/u:3t1hygdw].  Now how is that possible?  A game that is more like an interactive novel with little combat (and effort) is larger than a game with a barter system, a turn-based combat system with weapons and armor and a variety of enemies, and gambling possibly be smaller?\n\nThe theory:  &quot;Welcome to Dream Valley&quot; has less redundant data.\n\nI define &quot;redundant data&quot; by how it is eliminated:  If I code a function to perform an action, then re-write it to do the same action but with less code, then I just eliminated redundant data.\n\nNow that doesn't mean less coding = better game arbitrarily, but it is good practice to attempt to do more with less.",
