Sitting in a circle, you start with someone pulling a card...depending on what the card is is the action you perform.\r\n\r\n  Ace: is &quot;Rule&quot; where you create a rule for the game and if someone breaks it they have to take a drink, like you can't say drink drank or drunk (that's hard).  \r\n\r\n  2: &quot;for You&quot; meaning if you draw the card, you choose who drinks.  \r\n\r\n  3: &quot;for Me&quot; you draw, your drink\r\n\r\n  4: all girls take a drink\r\n\r\n  5: &quot;categories&quot; meaning you choose a category like cars and go around in a circle naming types of cars, and the first one who can't think of one drinks\r\n\r\n  6: all guys take a drink\r\n\r\n  7: &quot;waterfall&quot; meaning the one who draws the card starts drink and you go around in a circle and you all drink but can't stop until the one who started it stops drinking.  Then the person to his(her) right can stop drinking. then the person to his(her) right can...and so on...so esentially the last person (the person to the pullers left) is screwed until everyone has finished drinking.\r\n\r\n  8: &quot;I never&quot;: you go around in a circle asking questions that you have done but you pose it as a I never statement...so you could say &quot;I have never driven a car&quot; , everyone (including you) who has actually riden in a car has to drink.  Then the next person asks.  You stop after either the person asking the I never is the only one drinking (in which case they have to drink twice) or else it has gone all the way around the circle.\r\n\r\n  9:  &quot;Social&quot; : everyone takes a drink\r\n\r\n  10: &quot;Rhyme Time&quot;: the person who pulls the card states a phrase.  The next person has to state another phrase with the last word rhyming the last word of the previous statement...and so on &quot;I have a orange cat&quot;...&quot;Who sleeps on the bathroom mat&quot;...&quot;He wears a straw hat&quot;...and so on...the first person to screw up drinks...\r\n\r\n  J: &quot;Back&quot; the person who pulled before you drinks.\r\n\r\n  Q: &quot;Questions&quot; starting with the person who pulled the card, they must ask a question.  Then that person turns to a random person and asks another question pertaining to the last question, then they turn to another...&quot;Why is the moon grey?&quot;  &quot;Is the moon really grey?&quot;  &quot;Isn't the moon made of cheese?&quot; and so on.  The first person to screw up drinks.\r\n\r\n  K: This is where the cup in the middle comes into play.  If you pull a king, you poor as much of your drink as you want into the cup...The person to pull the last king has to drink it all (3 Kings worth of beer).\r\n\r\n  This game gets you gone fast...plus it's a fun social game.",
