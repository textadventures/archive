Im working on an idea for a Sci-Fi colony storyline.\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that Quest can be used to make some pretty complex games and much easier then using a MUD server, you just have to figure out how to handle combat.  Has anyone worked on Quest along this line?\n\nThanks and have a great day!",
