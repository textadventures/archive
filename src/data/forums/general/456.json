IE uses all kinds of generic html syntax exclusive to it. Also the reason they have the monopoly, isn't because, Word is the best windows word processor, office has the best office tools. Those are all opinions. Microsoft also had the first foot and an inside track into designing all these tools for windows, and even went out of their way to make it harder for open source alternatives to be made. Hell, openoffice doesn't handle all excel situations right because microsofts licenses.<br/><br/>Also unrelated, but here's a picture of my badass new desktop.
