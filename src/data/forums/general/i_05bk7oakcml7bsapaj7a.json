      "EditableText": "Hello\r\nI want to make something real simple for me and my friends; I enjoy doing this kind of stuff so I thought why not give it a try. After searching for a while, I still can't decide which platform/engine/software to use. This is what I'd like to achieve.\r\n\r\na) This \"comedy adventure\" I want to make is supposed to be set in a maze, so having north/west/south/east directions is a must. Another must is a \"score\" that should always be displayed. There won't be stuff like health, money, or whatever: I'll use score for everything (\"if you have 200 score, then you can enter this room\" kind of stuff; or at a high score there is a special encounter; etc). An inventory system should also be necessary: things like keys, items, artifacts, to carry and to drop, etc.\r\nb) Now I know what you're all thinking: QUEST! And well that's also what I have installed on my PC right now. But I have a few things that I don't really like about it. Uploading the game online is basically a must: if you give the file to other people they need to have Quest installed (which is dumb); there is no option to make a simple, clean, global-accepted .exe file; and even if you do upload the thing online, then your friends still have to register to the website! I mean, ok, but that deters people.\r\nc) I need to be able to change all the keywords and everything related. Right now in Quest to change the word \"look\" or \"go\" I need to do some real complex stuff and I'm not even sure what I'm doing. I need to be able to change all of these. Right now I'm not even sure I can't change the \"score\" word to one of my own\r\nd) A minimum of scripts for encounters or other stuff. For example \"There's a baddie in the room! You punch him, you seduce him, or you fake yourself as a blind man?\" and then you have a choice. Stuff like that.\r\n\r\nQuest would really be perfect if it wasn't for b) and c) which I hope you can give me a solution for.\r\nAny other software besides Quest that meets the requirements is welcome!\r\n\r\nSorry for my english, cheers",
