In no post of mine have I inflected outappropriate words toward you (or your shoes).  If you can't respond KINDLY, then please post somewhere else (in other words, take your shoes and leave my thread, my yarn, safe from your lacing, please).  See, I follow UNITED while you're stuck in UNTIED, but I'm unraveling the truth, while you've tied truth in a knot, although I don't want to see you slip, and if  you decide no retraction is necessary, then: Shoe fly, shoe; boot yourself out.<br/><br/>Best Regards (and I hope you pump up your sole),<br/><br/>-Witch Wyzwurd (size 10.5)",
