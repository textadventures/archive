Thus, players need to be able to play the game on our server. We can upload assets, but we have no game to upload because the game requires that it be run on our server, with our database, and our backend code.\r\nCould we do it using an Iframe or do you have any other solution for us? \r\nThanks for your help.\r\nLeila\r\n",
