I'm just venting.  There are now 80-ish games remaining yet to be catergorized and I'm willing to bet that 70-ish are destined to the sandpit.  Why would people create games that are that poor?

If not, why do it?  Why waste time?  So, I am stuck between being brutally honest and nurturing.  But, I've been nurturing in the past (far more than I have been brutal) and in not one case have I seen a quality game as a result.  That goes for those I have even thought there might be some promise in.  Should I now just ignore the garbage and keep clicking sandpit, or should I continue to try and help those who I see a glimmer in?\n\nBottom line:  Those of you who make good games, PLEASE find time to make more so I don't lose my mind.  If nothing else, give me some light in this dark tunnel and throw a sample/demo my way so I can breathe a sigh of relief.  I'm going crazy here!",

They pointed out the errors in his games, told him how to fix them, offered him advice on writing better games, offered to test them for him, even offered to spell check his games to get rid of the many, many typos. He ignored them all. Every game he wrote was worse than the last. He never made the slightest attempt to improve. All the time and effort spent trying to help him was wasted and when he finally left the scene, everyone breathed a massive sigh of relief. I often think that if people hadn't tried so hard to help him, he'd have got bored and left a long time before he did. He only hung around for so long because he had a captive audience.",
