But don't quit using Quest because of that or because of what some forum members will say to you about your spelling and such.  A large percentage of Quest games get slammed for poor spelling.  Even Dr. Froth's game that placed in IF (congratz Froth!) was spotted with grammatical errors (I played it and I can attest to that).  Quest is a good platform from which to build your game with though.\r\n\r\nSlamming appears frequently in Quest forums at times, and usually one  member becomes the focus.  And, yes, they can sometimes be silenced by threads being locked (fairly or unfairly).  Suggestion: just post about building games, helping others build games, or to push your own game.  Don't get caught in an argument, because no matter how right or wrong you are, you'll only get pounced on.  Remember: people here are only reading words on a screen, and don't necessarily connect that to a real person with emotions or an intellectual capacity.  Plus, how the words are set can be taken a few different ways by a few different people, including you.\r\n\r\nMany Quest games get plummeted with harsh responses by non-Quest users and Quest users alike.  Some of the games are quite lame, while some others strive to be a bit better.  As I understand, Steve gave you a poor review.  That's his opinion.  If you don't like his response and you feel your game is better than what he stated, then ignore him and continue to be happy with your game.  But give Steve the benefit of the doubt; is your game any better than what he made it out to be?  You shouldn't get angry about his response if it holds some value.... albeit harsh.   I've only experienced Steve to provide honest feedback and a friendly demeanor, so listen to what he has to say about why he responded to your game the way he did.\r\n\r\nI strongly suggest you don't get uptight about responses from moderators.  They are not any more unbiased than judges in a court of law.  And we both know that those judges slide in directions that aren't always fair to all.\r\n\r\nTry losing your anger over the issue and ask Steve and the moderators and Alex to restart a forum relationship from scratch.  If you feel you deserve an apology from any of them and/or if you feel you need to apologize too, then ask the ones who should apologize to do so and apologize yourself.  It's not condusive to a worthwhile forum, if members just squabble about useless issues.  And I think we can all agree with that.  And, Alex, it's not in your benefit if potential Quest users turn away from your product because of how they get treated.\r\n\r\nI really do believe in the Quest product and urge Michael The Gamer to stick around and help it flourish.

      "HTML": "<blockquote><cite>witch wyzwurd wrote:</cite>Hey Michael The Gamer,<br/><br/>I'm not sure of the whole debate here.  I read a-little awhile ago about how Steve gave you a bad review on a game you made.  That made you mad.  But don't quit using Quest because of that or because of what some forum members will say to you about your spelling and such.  A large percentage of Quest games get slammed for poor spelling.  Even Dr. Froth's game that placed in IF (congratz Froth!) was spotted with grammatical errors (I played it and I can attest to that).  Quest is a good platform from which to build your game with though.<br/><br/>Slamming appears frequently in Quest forums at times, and usually one  member becomes the focus.  And, yes, they can sometimes be silenced by threads being locked (fairly or unfairly).  Suggestion: just post about building games, helping others build games, or to push your own game.  Don't get caught in an argument, because no matter how right or wrong you are, you'll only get pounced on.  Remember: people here are only reading words on a screen, and don't necessarily connect that to a real person with emotions or an intellectual capacity.  Plus, how the words are set can be taken a few different ways by a few different people, including you.<br/><br/>Many Quest games get plummeted with harsh responses by non-Quest users and Quest users alike.  Some of the games are quite lame, while some others strive to be a bit better.  As I understand, Steve gave you a poor review.  That's his opinion.  If you don't like his response and you feel your game is better than what he stated, then ignore him and continue to be happy with your game.  But give Steve the benefit of the doubt; is your game any better than what he made it out to be?  You shouldn't get angry about his response if it holds some value.... albeit harsh.   I've only experienced Steve to provide honest feedback and a friendly demeanor, so listen to what he has to say about why he responded to your game the way he did.<br/><br/>I strongly suggest you don't get uptight about responses from moderators.  They are not any more unbiased than judges in a court of law.  And we both know that those judges slide in directions that aren't always fair to all.<br/><br/>Try losing your anger over the issue and ask Steve and the moderators and Alex to restart a forum relationship from scratch.  If you feel you deserve an apology from any of them and/or if you feel you need to apologize too, then ask the ones who should apologize to do so and apologize yourself.  It's not condusive to a worthwhile forum, if members just squabble about useless issues.  And I think we can all agree with that.  And, Alex, it's not in your benefit if potential Quest users turn away from your product because of how they get treated.<br/><br/>I really do believe in the Quest product and urge Michael The Gamer to stick around and help it flourish.

Simple as that.<br/><br/>Other people have kindly backed me up with my reputation in here.  I am generally a nice person.  You've been requesting apologies.  Maybe some are due to you from others.  But not from me.  I did not do anything wrong (please correct me, Alex and moderators, if there was something I said out of order).  If anything, Michael, you owe everyone an apology for your continued attacks and you owe me an apology for your retaliation of my honest comment and giving me a one star for that reason alone.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Michael wrote:</cite>I can predict the future of this topic <br/>a moderator will lock this topic <br/>lets see whats happening...</blockquote><br/><br/>That is almost a definite.  Be well, Michael.",
