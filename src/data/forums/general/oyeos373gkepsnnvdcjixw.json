      "EditableText": "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am thinking of making a mod for a game called Project Zomboid. The mod will be adding books within Project Zomboid. Players who install the mod will be able to find these books. These books will be labeled appropriately for their text interactivity. I need text stories for these books from you nice folks. If a player reads one with your text story in it, your text story will play out for them. I am new at modding, so the stories needed needs to be in the same principle as the copyrighted titled books \"Choose Your Own Adventure\". This means the text adventure will have to only be to choose from multiple paths. There will be no pictures, no inventory to hold things in, no dice etc. I am a fan of Project Zomboid and would like to make a mod like this for fans. I am not looking to receive any money. My actions are free for the betterment of the games enjoyment. \r\n\r\nI have been looking through https://textadventures.co.uk/ and found text adventures under the conditions described above. Here is a couple of examples that I found... \r\n\r\nVirgin Space by ByFernanz\r\nBeyond the Boundary by Lightningslash14\r\n\r\nI have not been able to reach the authors of those examples I just mentioned. I have not been able to contact others who's games fall under the conditions mentioned. I thought to open a thread in the hopes to find interested parties. I will of course be adding the names of the authors to anyone's work I have been given permission to use. \r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested please message me. I will also keep an eye on this thread.

      "EditableText": "I see there is some confusion. The game called \"Project Zomboid\" is a standalone game like \"Minecraft\" or \"SIMS\", if you heard of them. I am trying to think of games everyone knows. We are talking about a completely different mechanic than Quest or Squiffy belong to. Think PAC-MAM or TETRIS and compare that to Quest or Squiffy. This kind of complete differences is what I mean. Project Zomboid has nothing to do with text adventure, or anything to do with telling a CYOA story. \r\n\r\nProject Zomboid is a zombie game that you need to survive through and is heavily based on real world mechanics. Modders create mods to inject more mechanics into the game. In my case, I want to inject books. These books, I will need write them to read like the copyrighted titled \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books technique which is only to have multiple choice text directions to choose from, nothing more, nothing less. Players who play Project Zomboid have a chance to find these books on bookshelves. If they find one, they can read it. If they read it, they play out the text adventure as I just described and choose their path in text. The text will appear on screen. The direction choices will appear under the text. You are not taken into the book, you are only presented the text on your screen and goes away when you close the book. The real game players are experiencing is Project Zomboid and not these injections of mods. Injecting my mod, text adventure books, into the game is to only add realism and something to do in Project Zomboid. There are many many mods for Project Zomboid injecting many many things. I want to add my own twist to the modding world and inject text adventure books. \r\n\r\nBluevoss, I do not understand what you mean by randomness. Are the parameters of your style of text adventure writing the same as the copyrighted titled Choose Your Own Adventure books? If it is in the same style, then any randomness or whatever is acceptable. Following only the template of the copyrighted titled Choose Your Own Adventure books will work in my mod. Your next question, how big of a game? A player in Project Zomboid can always stop reading the text adventure for a while and go back to the book later, but the book should not be too long to finish. What is reasonable... 1 hour? I would think 15min to 1 hour for now, give or take. I will need player feedback to know what is the correct threshold. I will send you a private message to further talk about the subject if you are interested. \r\n\r\nCreating a mod of this sort for Project Zomboid is a nice way to extend your work. Anyone interested, I will continue to monitor this thread and my inbox. ",
