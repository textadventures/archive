      "EditableText": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am a novice when it comes to programming with beginner level understanding. I was trying to make a Cartesian coordinate map using an x and y axis and using the room object as a node along the map grid. I was able to make a X 50 by Y 50 grid with entry points in all 8 directions ( N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) but was wanting to make a larger map (100 X by 100 Y was my original goal.) Sadly, I ran into a memory error after having some excessive amount of objects in the game (the number of exits were somewhere in the 25,000's range and the number of room objects were in the 1000's before it finally read the memory error.) While I'm probably program this  \"game board\" in the most tedious and inelegant way as possible, after running into these errors, I thought that I might be able to get some help from the forum. I did a quick search and couldn't find anything on adding rooms in batch, or some other method which would be less resource heavy and more program efficient. Any suggestions would be appreciated and I'm more than willing to learn how to make this better with a little direction. Thanks!",

I like the idea of having a set number of rooms that can be modified, that seems really easy to implement and makes a lot of sense. I also watched a couple of tutorials on TRISBORT and it looks very promising and it would be a useful tool for mapping. Since I'm a really new to this whole coding thing, I think I'll try both of these methods just for the sake of practice. I definitely plan on making more than one game, but having a template  or getting use to tools that will help me become more effective is also part of becoming a better developer.  Thanks again, your help is very much appreciated! Kudos!",
