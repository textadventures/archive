I'm a student of game design and think that the absolute best way of starting off is with a text-adventure, since it require only text and code (even though you do can add other assets, later).

I am working on this little game which pays an affectionate parody of his works, since he's very into texting adventures, having said a few times that Infocom's Trinity was one of his favorite games of all time.",
