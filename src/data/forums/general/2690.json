I will be in game most of the morning on Saturday, watching a football game at noon then I will be back on for a bit. I'm usually on most evenings, look for DRAFT or DRIFT (my two characters). Give me a shout in chat if you log in. You can go to the chat room at The Old Hall or just click the chat icon in the bottom right pane.",

Calbrenth's Journey now has Guilds with their own private forums, also, each guild will provide its members with free items and a special quest with unique items only available through that guild.\n\nThe guilds are joined via a paying membership (using game money, not yours), this means memberships are progressive making it possible to be a member of several guilds over time. Each guild will only be created when new content has advanced to a point in the game that enough player money can be accumilated to join the next guild. \n\nThe Guild of Sirrah, first in the game, is now open (including private forum) though the quest portion of Sirrah is still being written.\n\nIn further news, I have finished most of my current admin work and have resumed writting new content. I hope to finish the first town, Haworth, within the month and finalize The Bronte Way and The Guild of Sirrah shortly there after. \n\nI look forward to this milestone and getting started on a whole new town called Harrogate where I hope to push the limits of the script being used to new limits. Hope to see you at [url:wrksjiun]http&#58;//www&#46;adventuredraft&#46;com/[/url:wrksjiun] and look forward to chatting with you in Calbrenth's Journey.\n\nDraft\nAdventureDraft.com",
