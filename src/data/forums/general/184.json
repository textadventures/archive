      "EditableText": "Here's a liitle something I came up with.\n\nIt's called the Internet Refresher Reminder.  Basically, you enter a number from 1 upwards.  You hit the Set Timer button to set the timer, then hit Timer Go to set the timer going.  When time is up, it notifys you with a message box telling you to refresh your connection.\n\nThis is useful if you have a connection that times out every now and then, and you know when it will like me.  The reason I made it is because sometimes I have to wait up to 10 minutes to reconnect once it times out, but only takes less than 2 minutes to disconnect and reconnect.\n\ncheck it out here: \n[url]http://us.f1f.yahoofs.com/bc/2a9bcfa0/bc/Cool+Stuff/Internet+Refresher+Reminder.exe?bfnTuo_AuY7XreT3[/url]\n\nThe next version should play a sound, but I don't know how to play sound in VB.\n\nHope you like it!\n\nMatthew G.",
