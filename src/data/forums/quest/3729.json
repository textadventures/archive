I figured out that I can add an offset in the attributes that allow me to go 'down' the stairs, draw the bottom of the stairs offset where it should be, and change the graphics to represent a different floor level.\nOnly thing I can't do is get it to draw a line between the top and bottom of the stairs.\nWhile we are at it, I'd like to make 'down' and 'east' synonymous so either command will go to the same place. Since both are already commands, that probably won't work.\n\nSo, that's TWO questions, heh.\n\n\nedit:  I did work out one unique way although it's a pain because you have to manually work out the coordinates for drawing a line.\nI use a script to draw a red line from the one node to the other.  Since it runs at a slope and is a different color it uniquely identifies the line as a stairs/ramp kinda path.  You have to draw it twice on each level otherwise it greys at on one of the levels.  Looks nice, clearly indicates what is going on, and lets you use 'up' or 'down' commands while clearly seeing which direction you are going. (which is a problem when only using text: going 'down the stairs' means what direction?  Can possibly lead to a disoriented player.)\n\nAnyway, I'm thinking there are other approaches, like going 'east' but changing the z-position in a script, although I haven't seen where to access variable.\nthanks",

It will work in both directions too. ie. go East or Down to 'bottom of stairs' and go Up or West to the 'top of stairs'.\nSometimes the obvious works well. <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->",

Then you need to decide which exit (if any) you want to show to the player.  Once decided, in quest, select the exit of the room in the pane on the left, and it should bring up the exit details.
