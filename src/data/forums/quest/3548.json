      "EditableText": "I am in the process of creating a game using Quest and I have got both the countdown timer and the show picture to work fine. But, I have two questions regarding these options. First, I want the countdown timer to display in minutes and NOT just seconds. I am using the tutorial on the Quest website under help. Second, I have a animated .gif showing as a picture and want it to stop looping and clear the animated pic after it is done. Or have a pop-up window display the picture or animation, then close after done. Are these possible, and if so how would I achieve this?\n\nThank You\nInsertCoin25",

The &quot;+59&quot; part means that the coundown won't hit zero until seconds hits zero.\n\nFor the latter part (hiding an image), you can either clear and redraw the screen without it (if you have that level of control), or you'd have to get more advanced to use HTML/CSS/Javascript to hide the element.",
