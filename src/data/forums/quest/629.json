How do you, in QDK, if you use a script description of a room rather than a regular text description, get the name of the room to appear like it normally does (you are in, then the name of the room in blue), along with a list of objects in the room??? This is probably a very easy question to answer, and if anyone can, I'd be happy. \n\nOh, and one other thing... Can you change a menu mid-conversation? For example, if I ask a guy about pigs, and he says pigs like mud, is there a way to open the menu again with the same options as before but this time with \"mud\" added to the possibilities???\n\nThx",
