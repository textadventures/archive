When I run the ShowRoomDescription command, Quest shows the description of the room, object list and exits normally, but the clickable verb list associated with each object of the rooms does not show up when I click on the hyperlinks.  This is opposed to allowing the room description to automatically be activated on entering a room.\r\n\r\nI hope this has an easy solution... I struggled a lot and I run out of options.\r\n\r\nThanks!!",
