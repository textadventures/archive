Unfortunately I can't commit to a project like that, and definitely can't promise to come up with something that will sell, since my own commercial track record is dismal. But I'll be around to answer questions. To get started, copy-and-paste the source code from my second link into a new Squiffy project, and play around with it. I'll delete my copies when you're all set.\r\n\r\nBest wishes and hope this helps,\r\nFelix",
