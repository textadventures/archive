Most names seem to be insentitive, but a few, such as destroy, are not (I would prefer to use Destroy than destroy, so all function names are in title case, to differentiate from variables).\n\nWhen in code view, pressing crtl-F opens up the search box. Would be nice if it moved the cursor there too. This seems to happen if the search box is already open, but in that case it would be nice if the existing search text was highlighted.\n\nSome clues about where a syntax error might be.
