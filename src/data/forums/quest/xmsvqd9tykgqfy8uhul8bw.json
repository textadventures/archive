      "EditableText": "Heyall\r\n\r\nSo in a shop, I was wondering if there's a way to find obj.name from  a string.\r\n\r\n```\r\noptions = NewStringList()\r\nproductlist = NewObjectList()\r\nforeach (x, GetDirectChildren (aiditems)){\r\n    if (IsRegexMatch (\"pharmashop\", x.selltype)){\r\n        list add (productlist, x)\r\n        x = x.alias + \" ( \" + x.price + \")\"\r\n        list add (options, x)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlist add (options, \"exit interaction\")\r\n```\r\nFirst, I added the needed objects using a filter. I didn't use the filterbyattribute because the object can be bought in several places. I created the \"selltype\" string attribute, then added \"pharmashop, medics\". So it will be selected in both places for buying.\r\nI also added the price to the brackets. \r\nThen:\r\n```\r\nShowMenu (\"What product would you like to buy?\", options, false) {\r\n    foreach (x, productlist){\r\n        if (IsRegexMatch (result, x)){\r\n            BuyObject(x)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    msg (\"Thank you for your purchase! Would you like another product?\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is where I'm stuck. In ShowMenu, how can I get the object from a string chosen by the player so that I can Clone it and add it to the player?",
