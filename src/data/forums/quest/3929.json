If the player doesn't use the right object or leave the room, the player is eaten by the monster after another 15 seconds.\n\nThe problem I have encountered with this it that I have it running from an [If player is in room, If monster does not have flag 'distracted'; For the first time run &lt;print message&gt;, otherwise run &lt;print massage&gt;&lt;end game&gt;] type of thing.  This works well if my player stands in the room and waits to get eaten, or makes a move that triggers the 'distracted' flag.  When my player leaves the room, then comes back however, I want the timer to restart, and display the warning message again.  As it works right now, my player can leave the room to avoid getting eaten, but it only appears to &quot;pause&quot; the timer, because going back in that room will trigger getting eaten by the monster.  I think it waits the 15 seconds of the timer, but I'm not certain that it even waits that long if the player took some time after the warning message to leave the room the first time.  I have the room scripts set so that the timer is enabled when the player walks into the room and disabled when the player leaves, I thought that would fix the problem but doesn't seem to help at all.  \n\nI'm pretty sure the problem with my command is the &quot;first time&quot; script I'm running (because obviously if the player sees the message, leaves and comes back it isn't the first time the player will see the message, and that makes sense) but I don't know what to use instead.\n\nAny advice or suggestions will be much appreciated.",

I haven't had many instances of it freezing the web player completely, and that problem hasn't been exclusive to that room, so I'm not sure if the timer is causing it entirely.  I guess my question now is, if I get the bugs in the timer worked out in my desktop Quest, would the issue still arise if someone tried to play the game in a browser window instead of downloading it?",

      "HTML": "When I locked the room north to keep my play testers from continually pointing out the issues, I added the global command &quot;testport&quot; which will take you directly into that room, and I left the exit south open.  I downloaded the file last night into my desktop Quest program so I could access the filters to change one of the commands ( 'shoot gun at target' instead of currently 'shoot gun with target')  I will redownload the file tonight so I can try to work out the snags with the timer outside of the web-browser.<br/><br/>I did run into the same problem of it not displaying the room description on exiting to the south as well, I though maybe the computer I am on was just slowing down a bunch because I keep flipping back and forth between programs. (Theoretically I'm actually working right now, which is why I don't have access to the desktop Quest.)<br/><br/>Thanks for your help so far, it seems to play pretty well now except for the bug with the room description on exit.
