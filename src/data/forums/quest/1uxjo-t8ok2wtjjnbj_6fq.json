Quest's 'Elements' are its internal coding OBJECTS of its Object-Oriented Design/Programming: OOP/OOD, structure) does NOT have to be involved in actual game play, you can use Objects as folders, to organize your Objects, be they themselves involved or not in actual game play. You can either nest Objects in other Objects or use the 'parent' Object Attribute, they both do the same thing. An Object without the 'parent' Object Attribute (or rather, technically, it's Value is 'null'), simply means that its parent is the 'asl' GAME OBJECT, in other words, it's not contained within another 'Object' Element.</p>\n<p>for example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;asl version=\"550\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;game name=\"NAME_OF_GAME\"&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n\n  &lt;object name=\"room\"&gt;\n    &lt;/inherit name=\"editor_room\" /&gt; // this is deleted when the game starts/is played, so don't ever reference it with your scripting\n    &lt;object name=\"player\"&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=\"editor_object\" /&gt; // this is deleted when the game starts/is played, so don't ever reference it with your scripting\n      &lt;inherit name=\"editor_player\" /&gt; // this is deleted when the game starts/is played, so don't ever reference it with your scripting\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n\n  /*\n  this is the same as the above (except for organization, which if you're working in the GUI/Editor, than you'd want to use the nesting above instead of the 'parent' Object Attribute usage below, so you've got that \"folder\" containment heirarchy organization):\n\n  &lt;object name=\"room\"&gt;\n    // either:\n    // (no 'parent' Attribute added/typed in)\n    // or\n    // &lt;attr name=\"parent\" type=\"object\"&gt;null&lt;/attr&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n\n  &lt;object name=\"player\"&gt;\n    &lt;attr name=\"parent\" type=\"object\"&gt;room&lt;/attr&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  */\n\n// only 'china', 'india', 'germany', and 'united_kingdom' would be actual rooms you can go to during game play:\n// (all other Objects are 'folders/storage/data' Objects --- you may want some interation with them or not, depending on your game design)\n\n  &lt;object name=\"world\"&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"earth\"&gt;\n      &lt;object name=\"europe\"&gt;\n        &lt;object name=\"germany\"&gt;\n        &lt;/object&gt;\n        &lt;object name=\"united_kingdom\"&gt;\n        &lt;/object&gt;\n      &lt;/object&gt;\n      &lt;object name=\"asia\"&gt;\n        &lt;object name=\"china\"&gt;\n        &lt;/object&gt;\n        &lt;object name=\"india\"&gt;\n        &lt;/object&gt;\n      &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n\n// only 'fireball_spell', 'inferno_spell', 'claymore', and 'katana' would be in-game items/objects:\n// (all other Objects are 'folders/storage/data' Objects --- you may want some interation with them or not, depending on your game design)\n\n  &lt;object name=\"magic\"&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"fire_magic\"&gt;\n      &lt;object name=\"fireball_spell\"&gt;\n        &lt;attr name=\"damage\" type=\"int\"&gt;10&lt;/attr&gt;\n      &lt;/object&gt;\n      &lt;object name=\"inferno_spell\"&gt;\n        &lt;attr name=\"damage\" type=\"int\"&gt;25&lt;/attr&gt;\n      &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"water\"&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"air\"&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"earth\"&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n\n  &lt;object name=\"equipment\"&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"weapons\"&gt;\n      &lt;object name=\"swords\"&gt;\n        &lt;object name=\"claymore\"&gt;\n          &lt;attr name=\"damage\" type=\"int\"&gt;50&lt;/attr&gt;\n        &lt;/object&gt;\n        &lt;object name=\"katana\"&gt;\n          &lt;attr name=\"damage\" type=\"int\"&gt;50&lt;/attr&gt;\n        &lt;/object&gt;\n      &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"armors\"&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"clothing\"&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;object&gt;\n\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<p>and as Pixie stated, unfortunately, your Objects can be re-ordered/sorted within the GUI/Editor/by-quest, so, you don't have any control over this, unless you go into the internal coding, and code yourself whether, and if so, how Objects are sorted/ordered within the GUI/Editor... not something for code amateurs like myself to do, lol.</p>\n\n",
