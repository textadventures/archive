I browse the file, hit \"Upload\" and it just automatically replaces the file on my first game with no further input from me. \r\n\r\nI tried creating a new game under \"Start Building Your Game Online\" but it only opens up the web version of Quest. I tried doing that just to make the listing and then going in under \"View/Edit Game Listing\" and replacing the game file. It  says it uploaded, I return to the game page and nothing has changed, it's still the intro game with just \"You are in a room\". Do I have to create an entire second account with a different email/login just to be able to upload a second game? \r\n\r\nI unfortunately can't share either listing here because, to be perfectly transparent, they are both adult content. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Also I just discovered that when I go into \"View/Edit Game Listing\" for the new game and upload the file there, though I am POSITIVE it's the new listing it's being uploaded to, it still changes the file on the first game.
