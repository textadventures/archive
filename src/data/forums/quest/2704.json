Granted, it was only a few words, but it was a bit repetative, but nothing major.\nThe scenery box, for me, is just amazing. The uses of it makes things so much easier.\nAs well as using the scen box on a room &quot;house&quot; to keep all the actual rooms of the house orgainized, I found it a huge assest for what I did in the bathroom.\nWhen entering bathroom, lights are off, giving only a descrip of being dark &amp; can't see anything. Once light switch is turned on, descrip tells what is there as well as obj's are now listed.\nUsing a scen container that is open/closeable, light off sets container closed, light on sets container open, giving the feel of a dark room &amp; lit room.\nI will have many questions for the Quest 5 guru's very soon, as of yet I'm still just creating rooms, giving descriptions, using scen so player can look at floor walls etc. &amp; getting familiar with the program itself.
