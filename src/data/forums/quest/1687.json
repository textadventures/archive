      "EditableText": "I am sorry if this has been posted before, but is anyone aware of a method or utility to enable single step execution of each program line. I used to be able to do this in Basic many years ago, and found it invaluable in tracing faulty code lines, by checking the contents of each variable after the pertinent line was executed. I use Programmers File Editor (freeware)  which I find is very good for source code editing, but to be able to actually execute the program line by line, would be the icing on the cake. Many thanks.",
