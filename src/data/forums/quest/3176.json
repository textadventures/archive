I'm a total newbie to Quest, meaning I probably missed this option somewhere, but in case I didn't, am I able to change the order that objects appear in the object list (the object list being the &quot;You can see [...]&quot; bit)?\nFor example if I had\n&gt; room\n&gt;&gt; lamp\n&gt;&gt; table\n&gt;&gt; chair\n\nCould I move &quot;chair&quot; so that it appears before &quot;lamp&quot; in the object list?\n\nEdit: Also, is there a way to remove the whole &quot;You see a ... ... ...&quot; and &quot;You can go ... ... ...&quot; lines? They kinda get in the way of the formatting for my game as is, and they're a little distracting.\nCheers!",
