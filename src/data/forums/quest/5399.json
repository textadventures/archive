I'm just here to let everyone know that there's a problem with timers.\n\nIt seems that if you perform an action at the precise time a timer ticks, it'll raise an error like the one below:\n\n[img:ttqw07th]http&#58;//i&#46;imgur&#46;com/6Rogv68&#46;png[/img:ttqw07th]\n\nInt32 and CanAdd errors have also appeared.\n\nLuckily, it isn't that big of a deal, but I've been able to isolate the trigger.\n\nThis particular error was caused by me trying to move to another room.\n\nThe CanAdd and Int32 errors might be different, but they seem to occur when I'm in combat and the game is subtracting from integers. I've only encountered these once or twice.",
