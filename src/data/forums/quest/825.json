I'm trying to set up my emote commands.  i.e. they player types in for instance, \"laugh\" and everyone sees something like, \"Boris, the fighter, doubles over in laughter.\"   And Boris should see, \"You double over in laughter.\"  \nI'm using qdk, so, forgive me, but I selected the bit for running a script for each object in the users current room.  I'm checking to see if #quest.thing# = $name(%userid%)$.  If it does, it's  supposed  to print the \"You double over in laughter\" bit.  otherwise it's supposed to print the \"Boris, the fighter doubles over in laughter.\", bit.  But it only prints the \"Boris, the fighter doubles over in laughter.\", bit to everyone, including Boris.  \nCan anybody see what I'm missing.  I appreciate the help.\n\nGary",
