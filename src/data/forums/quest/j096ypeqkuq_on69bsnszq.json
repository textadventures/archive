      "EditableText": "Just replied on another thread, but I see what you are trying to do here. There is a problem with the HTML tags, which may be the issue here. Firstly, you need to swap `HEX CODE` for the actual hex code for the colour, with a `#` at the start (or the name of a colour). Secondly you need to \"escape\" the quotes to tell Quest the quotes should be part of the string, rather than saying it is the start or end, and to do that put a backslash before them. Thirdly you have two of them at one point. Fourthly the end tag should not have \"color\" in it.\r\n\r\nThis will make it yellow, hopefully:\r\n```\r\n\"<font color=\\\"#808000\\\">skatingHeliophile [SH]</font> began pestering \" + (player.chumhandlefirst) + (player.chumhandlelast) + \" [\" + (player.chumhuandleinitials) + \"]\"\r\n```\r\nSo will this:\r\n```\r\n\"<font color=\\\"yellow\\\">skatingHeliophile [SH]</font> began pestering \" + (player.chumhandlefirst) + (player.chumhandlelast) + \" [\" + (player.chumhuandleinitials) + \"]\"\r\n```\r\n",
