If he/she puts ' boil the egg' then we get ' I don't see that (the egg). I realise that the prog allows the first 3 letters of a word to be recognised . Is the reason that 'them, Thews, thespian etc would be deleted. I realise also that you can add the to the command, but in a multi option command to cover all possible inputs, this doubles the effort. Perhaps  also the same for 'a'.",
