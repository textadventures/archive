But while you're doing that I don't see any reason why you can't work on the basic UI and functionality of your system.\n\nIe, creating simple items or types of items (glass objects for example, with effects like breaking.. Or musical instruments etc), or creating the way that you get a response for typing the wrong thing.",

I worked mainly on the features first, shops, inventory, levelling, that sort of thing. Then went back and made all the printed messages conform to a standard, a use colouring for specific meanings, such as yellow means money, green is speech.\n\nIt's a good idea to sit down for a while and just think about the sotry. As an MMO though you'll have to have pleny on the side other than the main plot and if there are different races then they may have different main plots. Get the setting of your game established, time preiod, how magic works, technology available, current social standings, economics, where non-human races come from, creation story or general time line leading up to when the story starts in your game. It's a lot of work.\n\nI've been working on my game for 2-3 years now.",
