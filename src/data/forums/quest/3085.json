      "EditableText": "Since Quest 5 is built on web-based technology, it's probably possible to bundle the Quest game into a standalone app using something like Adobe AIR, but I'm not entirely sure how you would go about that short of using Alex's JS converter, and I don't think he's going to release that any time soon. You could perhaps bundle the game in with the webplayer code and bundle that all together maybe? I think you can HTML + MySQL apps, so ASP.NET apps should be doable...\n\nYou'd have to do some digging and figure this out though if you're really determined to release a standalone game. Alternatively, you could always use learn to code in Quest 4 and use that instead, as it has a compiling function. Quest 5's emphasis is web though, so there's not likely to be any native support for standalone games.",
