I used to call it 'tail-end recursion' but that's not the correct term, lol. I still don't see/understand the difference between them... meh. Your tail and butt are one and the same, as both are referring to the opposite side of your head and neck. That's what it means to be a chordata organism, you got a single bar for your frame, your spine, which protects your central nerve frame from your brain to your opposite end, your butt/tail. One end of this single bar frame is the organism's head/neck/brain and the other side is the organism's butt/tail. You ingest through your mouth/head and excrete the waste/by-products out your anus-big-intestine/urethra-small-intestine at your bottom: backside's butt/tail and front-side's genitilia, But whatever, I digress, lol)\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, you do NOT want it to be forever, as that causes a crash, lol. This is called an 'infinite loop', which will crash quest.\r\n\r\nYou need a way of stopping it from being forever, there's many ways of doing this, as well as depending on the design/method of doing your looping as well.\r\n\r\none example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<game name=\"example_game\">\r\n  <attr name=\"start\" type=\"script\">\r\n    example_function\r\n  </attr>\r\n</game>\r\n\r\n<object name=\"Time\">\r\n  <attr name=\"minutes\" type=\"int\">0</attr>\r\n</object>\r\n\r\n<function name=\"example_function\">\r\n  SetTurnTimeout (5) {\r\n    set (Time, \"minutes\", Time.minutes + 60)\r\n    msg (Time.minutes)\r\n  }\r\n  ask (\"Continue?\") {\r\n    if (result) {\r\n      example_function\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</function>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis requires your input, vis using the built-in 'ask' pop up 'yes:true/no:false' window menu, which determines if it continues (does the scripting again: loops) or not\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nyou can do the same thing with a Script Attribute, instead of a Function, which is really better, as you can organize your systems better as it (Script Attributes) uses Objects, which are much more powerful/useful than Functions, an example:\r\n\r\n(Also, a Script Attribute can do the same argument/parameter and/or returning a value as a Function can, via using 'Delegates' with your Script Attribute, so really using Script Attributes are completely better than Functions, unless you're doing something really simple, as that would be \"overkill\", aka \"using a nuke to kill a fly\".
