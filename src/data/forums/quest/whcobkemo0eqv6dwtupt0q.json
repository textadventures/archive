      "EditableText": "I'm working on a proof of concept for a  monster hunting game with cryptids and had an idea for Baba Yaga. She'd be encountered in a hut walking around on chicken legs through a heavily forested area. How would I go about making a room that roams other rooms and has an \"in/out\" exit? Might even have the hut be two rooms, with the second one (kitchen) being only accessible from the first one (parlour) to make things simpler, if that's possible.\r\n\r\nI assume it would have something to do with making the hut an NPC and giving it patrols (preferably random ones or maybe even \"hunting\" patrols if the player makes a deal with Baba Yaga to find certain monsters for them in return for favors or a \"hiding\" patrol that avoids the players but still allows them to track it down) and then make the NPC also function as a room, but the issue I have with this is that I can't figure out how to make the hut carry the exit with it and activate it in each new room. The \"in/out\" exit just doesn't show up.\r\n\r\nWhat I am asking for is this:\r\n1. How can I make a separate room roam through an already established map?\r\n2. How can I make a room that doesn't roam by itself, but is instead attached to the first room at all times?\r\n3. How can I give the roaming room a patrol pattern that reacts to NPCs and the player character?\r\nAny and all help is appreciated.",
