From play testing the only thing I know for certain is that when I type &quot;smash cabinet with fire extinguisher&quot; that the text statement fires off and the cabinet does in fact become inaccessible.\n\nAny ideas why my 2 items inside the cabinet are not being exposed?",

      "EditableText": "Well, i figured it out.\n\nI guess there is a difference between using Quest to &quot;open&quot; a container and using a custom script. Appearently there is more happening when Quest uses the default &quot;open&quot; selection in the GUI to open a container, then just using the &quot;open object&quot; command.\n\nTurns out I never had to reveal a child object, but I did have to LOOK at it again. So this revised script works when opening a container thru other means.\n\nSo the below script now works when the player types in &quot;smash cabinet with fire extinguisher&quot;\n\nIf the player has &quot;fire extinguisher&quot;  and &quot;storage cabinet&quot; is in the current room  Then { \nOpen &quot;storage cabinet&quot; \nPrint &quot;[SIZE 00]You destroy the cabinet, revealing 2 items inside![NEW LINE]You see a container pack and a folded canopy.&quot; \nExecute &quot;look cabinet&quot; as if it were typed by the player } \n\nAlso, after you use the Look command again, you can then follow it with make cabinet inaccessible and the containers items still remain.\n\nThe response is now appropriate. I need the objects to show in the display with the bold font, so the players can be made very aware. I like the side GUI options, but don't want the players to have to get used to looking over there all the time. Especially in this situation, where the player has seconds left to assemble the parachute <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nHowever, I like the ability to sneak an object in on the right hand side and not have it show up in the description, as that feature has its situations. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nCheers,\n\nScott",
