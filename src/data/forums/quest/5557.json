      "EditableText": "I'm not sure if I'm using that term correctly or not...but here is the issue. \n\nI'm assuming it's this way for all Quest games, but when you save a game during play, it basically saves EVERYTHING from the point you left off, all the way back to the beginning. So my question is, is it possible for the game to dump all the previous text, while still retaining all the choices and events leading up to the place where the person saved (like, for example, if the player has a journal and recorded in it at the beginning, and the text dump happens, I'd want the journal to retain all the entries). So basically I'm asking if it's possible to  make the save files much smaller so that it doesn't have to load all the previous text that the player has already passed. \n\nThanks!",
