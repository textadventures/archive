      "EditableText": "Well, in essence I was going for a sort of limited 'teleport' ability that would allow the player to teleport to certain locations. I just used to identically-named commands: They can type the keyword alone to get a list of unlocked locations, read from a stringlist, and then be prompted for their choice; or they can simply type the keyword and the location if they already know it. The way I was going to do it likely isn't going to work now, so I'm wondering if this concept at least would: When they 'unlock' a location, add the name to the stringlist, and then add a similar item to a string dictionary? The key would be the name they would type, and the value the name of the destination? That way it can display them from the list, reference the dictionary, and get the destination from the value. This is just the first thing that came to me, now that I've gotten some sleep and it's not 3am, but I don't think I [i:14knafcm]quite[/i:14knafcm] understand string dictionaries yet, as I'm unsure if this would work.",
