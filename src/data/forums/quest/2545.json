Now I have two questions for my extremely simple &quot;combat system&quot; First: how do i set a health meter for the dog? It doesn't have to be shown in game but it shoul be there. Lets say i atttack the dog and do 5 damage to it but it doesn't die. But when 15 damage of the dog has been drained by me attacking it 3 times it should die. How do I that? \n\nSecond question: Back at the dog example, I have earlier had the possibility to pick up a chair leg as a weapon, how do i make it so that if I type &quot;attack dog&quot; when I have the chair leg I would do double damage to it? Or even set a different script to the dog when I have the chair leg in compare when I do have it?\n\nPlease do not call me stupid, be rude or insult me in any way because it's just a waste of both of our times. Please answer detailed and preferrably in steps so it gets easier for me to understand. And don't use some advanced terms I would not understand.",

      "EditableText": "I think you should be able to set up a different status variable for the Dog's health. Name it &quot;Dog Health&quot;, and then give it 15 as its initial value. In the Display, type in &quot;health: !&quot;. Then set up a script for when the dog reaches 0 health (he dies; object terminated). For the damage variable, you might need to set a script for damage that allows the &quot;Dog Health&quot; to decrement. This is a learning experience for me as well, so if that works let me know. If it doesn't, then I am still curious on how to work this script.",

If you put it into turns of damage, I believe you can set up a damage mechanic that will allow you to damage the dog's health. Same thing for this. I hope it works, if not...
