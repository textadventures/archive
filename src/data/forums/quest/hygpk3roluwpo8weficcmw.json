I'm looking at a system where you can use your cellphone to ask for help from the \"Master\" who set all these puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere's an (unreachable) room called \"hints box\", filled with hints. Each hint is an object. They have properties \"enabled\" and \"solved\". For example, if you try to open the red door and get the \"it's locked\" messagem the hint about finding the red key becomes enabled.\r\n\r\nYou can then \"ask for help with #text#\" or \"ask for help\". Both pick an enabled hint from the hints box, and put it in your phone where you can read it. The one where you specify a subject filters the pool of hints before choosing one.\r\n\r\nOnce you open the door, that hint is obviously no use. I was wondering what I should do with them; just delete them? Or maybe hints for solved problems become edible :p It sounds silly, but might work. I'm wondering if that feels fair; or what kind of bonus they could give when eaten.\r\n\r\nAlso unsure about the wording of the commands. It feels unintuitive, but I don't know what would be better. Any suggestions?",
