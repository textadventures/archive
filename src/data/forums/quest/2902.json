As far as i can tell GetInput is the way to do this, rather than 'Ask' or 'If player answers yes to...' or using menus... \n\nI am pretty inexperienced with the scripting side of quest, mostly stayed with the friendly stuff, so any help would be really appreciated.

      "EditableText": "Yeah, if you're not looking to use the popup menu, then GetInput() is probably what you want to use. Fortunately, it's actually pretty easy to use. Obviously, I don't know how your game is set up or anything, so I'm just going to write an example here to show how to use GetInput() properly. Hopefully you'll be able to extrapolate from that how to incorporate it into your game. This example will print a message asking the player a question, and then store their answer in the variable &quot;answer&quot;:\n\n[code:293zuipt]\nmsg (&quot;Do you like cheese?&quot;)\nanswer = GetInput()\n[/code:293zuipt]\n\nIt's that easy. From that point, you could either do a switch or an if statement to check if the answer was yes or no. Hope that helps.",
