My excuse is that I didn't know I could change the inventory response.\n\nHaving said that, is there a script which makes the player drop and take all? The one advantage of having it as a genuine container is because I have a scene in my game where the player hides all his equipment in a pile of boxes before entering a drug den, as he knows he will be body-searched (and would realistically probably have all his goodies stolen.\n\nIf I carry the items individually, it means scripting a long and laborious list of 'remove [item] from player' and then when he gets back outside and collects his bag, an equally long and laborious list of 'move [item] to player'. If I have a knapsack as a container, I only need say 'remove knapsack from player' / 'move knapsack to player'\n\nHK, I will try that code as it sounds like just what I need. I won;t be doing it tonight cos I'm knackered, but just so I can be thinking on it, where does that code go?",

My excuse is that I didn't know I could change the inventory response.<br/><br/>Having said that, is there a script which makes the player drop and take all? The one advantage of having it as a genuine container is because I have a scene in my game where the player hides all his equipment in a pile of boxes before entering a drug den, as he knows he will be body-searched (and would realistically probably have all his goodies stolen.<br/><br/>If I carry the items individually, it means scripting a long and laborious list of 'remove [item] from player' and then when he gets back outside and collects his bag, an equally long and laborious list of 'move [item] to player'. If I have a knapsack as a container, I only need say 'remove knapsack from player' / 'move knapsack to player'<br/><br/>HK, I will try that code as it sounds like just what I need.
