      "EditableText": "Not sure if I phrased that correctly, but basically I want to turn a flag on by a player clicking on a link in gamebook. The idea is I have created my own combat, class and stats system in gamebook, but I want to creat a shop. I would like to set it up so I dont have to create a different page with the turnflagon function for every item in the shop. Instead making a link from the shop back to itself that turns the flag on for me. Is this even possible in gamebook mode. I've tried commandlink and it wants a page instead of a function, and i tried &lt;finction&gt;&lt;/function&gt; but coulnt imbed it in a link.\n\nhopefully I was descriptive enough in my question",

I'm whipping this out before work, so I just added it into my &quot;gbtest&quot; game, so there's some other stuff in there you don't need. Just focus on Page1 and the function SomeFunction. Basically, the link directly invokes that function with an argument string which is then set into a player parameter. You can have the function (or functions) do whatever you like, and the argument string can be whatever you like as well.\n\nImportant note: your function *must* accept a single argument, even if you don't use it for anything.\n\nI just have the function redisplay the page with the new value, but (again) you can have it do what you like.
