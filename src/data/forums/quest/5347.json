Hmm...\n\nif you've got a preset play limit on your game (you get 200 turns to play the game or you get 200 'days' Integer Attribute to play the game), then it will be more easy...\n\nas we can create the intervals this way (this is a bit advanced, so you may not understand it, as you've probably not been exposed to this stuff yet):\n\n<!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/for.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/for.html</a><!-- m -->\n\n[code:35f77b2g]&lt;game name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;turns&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/game&gt;\n\n&lt;turnscript name=&quot;global_turnscript&quot;&gt;\n  hair_growth_function\n  game&#46;turns = game&#46;turns + 1\n&lt;/turnscript&gt;\n\n&lt;function name=&quot;hair_growth_function&quot;&gt;\n  for (x, 0, 200, 50) {\n    if (game&#46;turns = ToInt (x)) {\n      player&#46;hair_length = player&#46;hair_length + 2\n      msg (&quot;Your hair grew anotehr 2 inches in length&#46;&quot;)\n    } \n  }\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:35f77b2g]\n\n----\n\nif you don't want a preset play limit on your game, we could jsut do a preset limit on your hair growth (your hair growth will stop at turn 200, but you can keep plying the game into turn 1000), which would be done the same as above, actually, lol.\n\n----\n\nthe problem is that we need a preset limit (max), otherwise, this will go on forever (endless processing, like an endless code loop = quest crashes):\n\n(actually, I'm not sure if quest's 'for' allows for this, lol, though if we were using the 'foreach' we can have this issue created) \n\nfor (x, 0, no_max_limit, 50), would mean it forever does this:\n\non turn 0 -&gt; do scripts\non turn 50 -&gt; do scripts\non turn 100 -&gt; do scripts\non turn 150 -&gt; do scripts\netc etc etc\n(quest will likely crash before it gets to the below turn, lol)\non turn 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -&gt; do scripts\netc etc etc\non turn 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -&gt; do scripts\netc etc etc\n\nthis is why we need that max limit... so it doesn't go on for ever and ever (nothing can go on forever, everything breaks down with use and over time: entropy, including quest and~or your computer's prcoessor~CPU, lol. Endless prcoessing is very bad, as the hardware can't endlessly process! Your basic calculutor, yourself as well, and even a quantum computer, all will break down before it finds the value of pi, laughs)\n\nwhen I was a kid, I would challenge myself to how high I could verbally~speakingly count for without stopping...\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 100, ... 200, etc etc etc...\n\nserious fact: this is the best way to truly understand just how big a number really is !!!\n\nwhen you just see '500', you're like 'pfft, that's small'... ya well, try counting to it... it ain't so small... !!!\n\ndon't even think about trying to count to 1,000.... laughs... you've no idea how long that takes... even while trying to count as fast as you can (you get super tired and out of breath if you even actually reach 1000, lol)\n\ndon't even imagine counting to 10,000 or more.... lol.\n\n----\n\nor, a different design is to work with a 'day' Integer Attribute, either:\n\nincreasing:\n\ngame.day = game.day + 1\n\nor\n\ncyclic (sunday to saturday -&gt; sunday to saturday -&gt; etc etc etc):\n\ngame.day = (game.day + 1) % 7\n\nconceptually:\n\nthe % is the 'modulus' operator, it's basically division, except it only gives~returns~outputs~finds the remainder value\n\n[code:35f77b2g]game&#46;day = 0 % 7 -&gt; 0 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 0 -&gt; day 0\ngame&#46;day = 1 % 7 -&gt; 1 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 1 -&gt; day 1\ngame&#46;day = 2 % 7 -&gt; 2 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 2 -&gt; day 2\ngame&#46;day = 3 % 7 -&gt; 3 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 3 -&gt; day 3\ngame&#46;day = 4 % 7 -&gt; 4 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 4 -&gt; day 4\ngame&#46;day = 5 % 7 -&gt; 5 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 5 -&gt; day 5\ngame&#46;day = 6 % 7 -&gt; 6 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 6 -&gt; day 6\ngame&#46;day = 7 % 7 -&gt; 7 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 0 -&gt; day 0\ngame&#46;day = 8 % 7 -&gt; 8 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 1 -&gt; day 1\ngame&#46;day = 9 % 7 -&gt; 9 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 2 -&gt; day 2\ngame&#46;day = 10 % 7 -&gt; 10 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 3 -&gt; day 3\ngame&#46;day = 11 % 7 -&gt; 11 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 4 -&gt; day 4\ngame&#46;day = 12 % 7 -&gt; 12 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 5 -&gt; day 5\ngame&#46;day = 13 % 7 -&gt; 13 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 6 -&gt; day 6\ngame&#46;day = 14 % 7 -&gt; 14 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 0 -&gt; day 0\ngame&#46;day = 15 % 7 -&gt; 15 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 1 -&gt; day 1\ngame&#46;day = 16 % 7 -&gt; 16 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 2 -&gt; day 2\ngame&#46;day = 17 % 7 -&gt; 17 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 3 -&gt; day 3\ngame&#46;day = 18 % 7 -&gt; 18 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 4 -&gt; day 4\ngame&#46;day = 19 % 7 -&gt; 19 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 5 -&gt; day 5\ngame&#46;day = 20 % 7 -&gt; 20 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 6 -&gt; day 6\ngame&#46;day = 21 % 7 -&gt; 21 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 0 -&gt; day 0\ngame&#46;day = 22 % 7 -&gt; 22 / 7 -&gt; Remainder 1 -&gt; day 1\netc etc etc[/code:35f77b2g]\n\n[code:35f77b2g]day 0&#58; sunday\nday 1&#58; monday\nday 2&#58; tuesday\nday 3&#58; wednesday\nday 4&#58; thursday\nday 5&#58; friday\nday 6&#58; saturday\nday 0&#58; sunday\nday 1&#58; monday\nday 2&#58; tuesday\nday 3&#58; wednesday\nday 4&#58; thursday\nday 5&#58; friday\nday 6&#58; saturday\nday 0&#58; sunday\nday 1&#58; monday\nday 2&#58; tuesday\nday 3&#58; wednesday\nday 4&#58; thursday\nday 5&#58; friday\nday 6&#58; saturday\nday 0&#58; sunday\nday 1&#58; monday\nday 2&#58; tuesday\nday 3&#58; wednesday\nday 4&#58; thursday\nday 5&#58; friday\nday 6&#58; saturday\netc etc etc\netc etc etc[/code:35f77b2g]\n\n[code:35f77b2g]&lt;game name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;attr name=&quot;day&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;\n&lt;/game&gt;\n\n&lt;turnscript name=&quot;global_turnscript&quot;&gt;\n  if (game&#46;day = 3) {\n    // once a week (on wednesday), your hair grows another 2 inches\n    plauer&#46;hair_length = player&#46;hair_length +2\n  }\n  game&#46;day = (game&#46;day + 1) % 7\n&lt;/turnscript&gt;[/code:35f77b2g]",

Hmm...<br/><br/>if you've got a preset play limit on your game (you get 200 turns to play the game or you get 200 'days' Integer Attribute to play the game), then it will be more easy...<br/><br/>as we can create the intervals this way (this is a bit advanced, so you may not understand it, as you've probably not been exposed to this stuff yet):<br/><br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/for.html\">http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/scripts/for.html</a><!-- m --><br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;game name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;attr name=&quot;turns&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>&lt;/game&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;turnscript name=&quot;global_turnscript&quot;&gt;<br/>  hair_growth_function<br/>  game&#46;turns = game&#46;turns + 1<br/>&lt;/turnscript&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;function name=&quot;hair_growth_function&quot;&gt;<br/>  for (x, 0, 200, 50) {<br/>    if (game&#46;turns = ToInt (x)) {<br/>      player&#46;hair_length = player&#46;hair_length + 2<br/>      msg (&quot;Your hair grew anotehr 2 inches in length&#46;&quot;)<br/>    } <br/>  }<br/>&lt;/function&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>----<br/><br/>if you don't want a preset play limit on your game, we could jsut do a preset limit on your hair growth (your hair growth will stop at turn 200, but you can keep plying the game into turn 1000), which would be done the same as above, actually, lol.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>the problem is that we need a preset limit (max), otherwise, this will go on forever (endless processing, like an endless code loop = quest crashes):<br/><br/>(actually, I'm not sure if quest's 'for' allows for this, lol, though if we were using the 'foreach' we can have this issue created) <br/><br/>for (x, 0, no_max_limit, 50), would mean it forever does this:<br/><br/>on turn 0 -&gt; do scripts<br/>on turn 50 -&gt; do scripts<br/>on turn 100 -&gt; do scripts<br/>on turn 150 -&gt; do scripts<br/>etc etc etc<br/>(quest will likely crash before it gets to the below turn, lol)<br/>on turn 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -&gt; do scripts<br/>etc etc etc<br/>on turn 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -&gt; do scripts<br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/>this is why we need that max limit... so it doesn't go on for ever and ever (nothing can go on forever, everything breaks down with use and over time: entropy, including quest and~or your computer's prcoessor~CPU, lol.
