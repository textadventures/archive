Create a global turn script that adds one to an integer attribute on some object in the game.\r\n2.  At every 'nth' interval, set a changed attribute script (and you can make it random) to one of the weather descriptors that you want.  I used 15 turns equal one change of day from dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, dusk, evening, midnight.  At that change of day, the player would get a message and it would usher in a slew of game wide results - amount of light changing, number of bats seen/heard, different vendors come and go in the market area, etc.\r\n3.  On the 'nth + 1' integer count, reset the integer to 1 again.  Fifteen moves later you will get another random chance weather change. \r\n4.  The bitch is, come to find out, that you probably will want to change the descriptions for the weather for your rooms.  The easiest way to do this is to create an Inherited Attribute that adds weather descriptions for rooms with certain values, like (inside, nearwater, treesaround, openfield, etc...) and will spit out a descriptions that is suitable.
