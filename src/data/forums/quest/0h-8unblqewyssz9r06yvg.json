Your chest doesn't need to have anything in it at all until it's looked in, in fact. \r\n\r\nWhat you really have, in terms of the actual game, is a chest object and a list of objects that chest contains. You also have a state on the chest - opened or closed.

If the state is changed to opened, and the player looks in chest, then the game tells them the list of objects.\r\n\r\nSo that also applies to a \"false bottom\". There isn't really one there. There's just a state check. If player does some success action -> shake, hit, pry, whatever -> the game displays the appropriate message and checks to see if success is yes or no. If it's yes, it adds whatever was under the false bottom to the list of objects it'll display once the player looks into the open chest.\r\n\r\nStop thinking in terms of what you'd find in the real world, and start thinking in terms of what you want to have happen in reaction to events in the game.",
