      "EditableText": "Well, my game is certainly progressing nicely, but I am stuck on one tiny problem. Basically, I made a bag that can be picked up and is also a container. The idea is to make this bag my inventory. I also have a few items in the bag. These items get added to my inventory once I open the bag. The problem is that these items don't show when I type: Inventory. I can see them in my Inventory panel, but when I type: Inventory I get this reply: You are not carrying anything. That is the first thing that makes me stumped. The second problem is that if the bag is going to serve as my Inventory, I want to type something like: &quot;search bag&quot; and I want to call function to list all items currently in my inventory. I think one has to use the ScopeInventory function, but I do not know how.\n\nPS. I do not know if this is relevant, but the empty square under container tab where I check/uncheck  &quot;can be opened&quot; option is grayed out.\n\nHere is my failed attempt at doing what I described:\n[code:prjcen6l]if (GetBoolean(school bag, &quot;opened&quot;)) {\n  ScopeInventory\n}\nelse if (ListContains(ScopeVisible(), school bag)) {\n  msg (&quot;Upon searching the bag you find some &lt;font color=\\&quot;#00FFFF\\&quot;&gt;books&lt;/font&gt;, a &lt;font color=\\&quot;#00FFFF\\&quot;&gt;pencil&lt;/font&gt; and a &lt;font color=\\&quot;#00FFFF\\&quot;&gt;calculator&lt;/font&gt;&#46;&quot;)\n  AddToInventory (pencil)\n  AddToInventory (books)\n  AddToInventory (calculator)\n  MakeObjectVisible (books)\n  MakeObjectVisible (calculator)\n  MakeObjectVisible (pencil)\n  SetObjectFlagOn (school bag, &quot;opened&quot;)\n}\nelse {\n  msg (&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;)\n}[/code:prjcen6l]\n\nAs always, I am grateful for any help.",

So, let's do this explanation of mine, vertically, obviously.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>&lt;XXX&gt; ~~~ is the beginning 'tag'<br/>  // it's contents<br/>&lt;/XXX&gt; ~~~ is the ending 'tag'<br/><br/>think of these 'tag' blocks (think of these 'tag' blocks as a bag~container holding stuff), as your physical things (ELEMENTS) in coding. Like 'matter' if you're into physics, or 'nouns' if you're into english grammer~language.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------<br/><br/>whereas, scripting, is your actions in coding. Like 'forces~energy~waves~work' if you're into physics, or 'verbs' if you're into english grammer-language:<br/><br/>(the code lines or blocks with *NO* tags being used)<br/><br/>examples:<br/><br/>player.strength = player.strength + 5<br/>Do (this.open)<br/>// etc etc etc<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The Elements:<br/><br/>1A. Your Game File (*.aslx); your game's coding; your entire game:<br/><br/>&lt;asl&gt;<br/>  // mass of code lines<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;<br/><br/>tells quest that this is, and contains, your entire (coded) game file<br/><br/>1B. if you want to make a library file (*.aslx), instead of a game file:<br/><br/>&lt;library&gt;<br/>  // mass of code lines<br/>&lt;/library&gt;<br/><br/>tells quest that this is, and contains, a library file. (think of a library file as a 'patch', 'expansion pack', an 'add-on', a 'mod', and etc gaming terms, that you can add to game files)<br/><br/>2. your library files added to your game, example, the default library files (which is how quest works, hehe):<br/><br/>&lt;ref name=&quot;English.aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>&lt;ref name=&quot;Core.aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/><br/>3. your game's settings:<br/><br/>&lt;game&gt;<br/>  // your game's settings and game info stuff<br/>&lt;/game&gt;<br/><br/>4. Objects:<br/><br/>&lt;object&gt;<br/>  // it's contents<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>5. Templates (shown horizontally, as it's short):<br/><br/>&lt;template&gt;it's contents&lt;/template&gt;<br/><br/>6. Verbs<br/><br/>&lt;verb&gt;<br/>  // it's contents<br/>&lt;/verb&gt;<br/><br/>7+. I think you get the idea now... (Commands, Timers, Turnscripts, Object Types, Functions, and etc)<br/><br/>-------------------<br/><br/>Sub-Elements (they must be inside the correct Element tag block, aka the Element which can hold them):<br/><br/>1. Attributes (shown horizontally):<br/><br/>&lt;attr&gt;it's contents&lt;/attr&gt;<br/><br/>2. Exits<br/><br/>(too lazy, you know what the Exits are and how they look in code)<br/><br/>----------------<br/><br/>does this help you understand quest's code structure better, or has it just confused you more?</blockquote><br/><br/>I tried for almost an hour to make sense of this, experimenting and failing constantly. So quite honestly, you seem to be speaking with a language I do not understand. But thanks for trying to help me. It would help me a lot if you just downloaded the modified version I posted and made the necessary changes. Then I could see what you did and perhaps make sense out of this wall of alien text.",
