I've asked them only to go ahead with this if I'm allowed to change my mind and go back to SVN though (but I'd really rather not do that, as over the last few months it's become increasingly clear that CodePlex's implementation of SVN is fundamentally broken and unusable - massive bugs around branching, merging, and having multiple users commit to the repository... you know, pretty much the entire point of a VCS...).",
