This program is very intuitive and easy, so its fun to play with it. But i want to ask: Is there a possibility to play the games on a mobilephone? Or without the program? Like an old .bat file where you only have to run the file and can play? \r\n\r\nMaybe the question sounds silly, but i have the idea, that i could play my game in the train or bus or something else - you got it. Or maybe give it to other players to play. I found some textadventures in the app store of google, some interpreters... but to be honest, i dont have a clue how this could work. Anyone an idea? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLyrao\r\n\r\nSorry - i saw i posted in the wrong part of the forum. Could a mod please take this to the right forum? Thanks",
