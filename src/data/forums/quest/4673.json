      "EditableText": "Greetings everyone,\n\nI am very new here so I apologize in advance if my question seems amateurish.  Basically, I've been playing with Quest and I've been able to export a small test portion of my game to a .apk file, but it doesn't seem to work.  More precisely, none of the commands I've tried (except look) seems to do anything.  Am I organizing my objects and locations wrong?  Or perhaps I have a bit of code being annoying.  My real goal is to just &quot;go north.&quot;  No errors.  Just nothing happens.\n\nThanks!",
