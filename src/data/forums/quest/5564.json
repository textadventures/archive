Will report back once i find which solution works best for me.\n\nEDIT: In the end I didnt have much luck with Petrex code, but here is a neat trick for anyone that wishes to center their images. FIrst you create one wide image that stretches across the whole screen. I found that 687 pixels width is the best to work with. Then you color it so that it is the same color as your background in Quest. This is done so that you get a transparent effect. Save it as background. Then just copy the smaller image into the one you just named background. Save and import to quest. Ta daaa! Your smaller image is now neatly centered in Quest window.\n\nPS. How high the image is, depends really on the smaller image you wish to insert. For example, if I wish to insert a 100x100 image, I will make 687x100 background. Hope this helps those that might encounter the same problem.\n\nPS2.
