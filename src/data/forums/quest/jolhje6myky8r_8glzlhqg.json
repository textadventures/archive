      "EditableText": "I use Twine too, it is pretty good. Which to use depends on what you want to do. Quest offers a rich world model, in which rooms have relationships with each other, in which items can have persistent state and a place in that world. If you want all that in Twine, you have a lot of coding a head of you. Plus, of course, Quest has a parser, and if you want the player to be able to type commands, Twine is really not the tool.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if your game just uses links, and you do not need a world model, then Twine is the way to go. Or Squiffy, of course; I am not sure how that works on mobile, but I guess just as well (though there is software to convert Twine to an app).",
