This is an optional pane which by default can be configured to display a list of the player object's attributes. It sounds like your first custom pane might not be too hard to create using that existing system, leaving the custom pane for your pictures.\r\n\r\nIf you want more flexibility… well, there's nothing stopping you from having a single status attribute and putting a whole bunch of HTML into it so that it makes the statusattributes pane behave as a second custom pane.\r\n\r\nActually creating a second custom pane is possible (there are threads on the forum from a few years ago discussing how to do it), but it's quite a complex bodge to make it work. So I would suggest trying other options first if you can.",
