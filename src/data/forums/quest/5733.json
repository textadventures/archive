      "EditableText": "I would like to remove the built-in listed display verbs, especially the 'take' verb, in the objects pane on the right during game play.  I'm okay with the 'look at' remaining, but if it were gone too I would not complain.\n\nI know I can manually go through and click and remove them, but I have a LOT of objects.  I also realize that I COULD have done this with each object as I added them, but that's a whole other story.  Is there an option somewhere in the GUI (or code I can alter) to remove the verbs in one fell swoop?  I do NOT want to remove the pane, just the built-in verbs attached to them.\n\nThanks!",
