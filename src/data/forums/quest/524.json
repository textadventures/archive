      "EditableText": "Hey,\n\nBeen working on a game for a few weeks now (in QDK, with various manual adjustments), and it seems I've just run into a problem.  Was working on my game for an hour or two, closed it, and when I went to open it again tonight, I got an error.  When I try to open it, QDK spits out:\n\n[code:3s099n98]FATAL ERROR&#58; Expected &gt; in msg &lt;\nFATAL ERROR&#58; Expected &gt; in msg &lt;\nFATAL ERROR&#58; Expected &gt; in msg &lt;\nFATAL ERROR&#58; Expected &gt; in msg &lt;[/code:3s099n98]\n\nQuest, on the other hand, just gives me:\n\n[code:3s099n98]Errors found in C&#58;\\Program Files\\Quest\\rsimulation&#46;asl /--- LDF-ERROR&#58; Unspecified&#58; errors&#58;help ---/[/code:3s099n98]\n\nOk, so, no problem, I can fix this.  Just a syntax error.  The problem is, Quest isn't giving me any line numbers, and my game is already 103kb of text.  If it's at all avoidable, I really don't want to go through all that code by hand, checking each of the hundred's of messages to see if there's an end bracket.  So, my question is this: is there any sort of debugger for ASL that I can use to expedite the process?  Any [much] quicker way of doing this?  I'm using the evaluation version of QDK, if it makes a difference.  I'm going to buy pro eventually and all, I just can't at the moment.  Any help would be appreciated.",
