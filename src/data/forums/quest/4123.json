(there's some differences and~or more~less features between the two of them)\n~AND~\n2. text adventure mode or gamebook~storybook mode? (there's some differences and~or more~less features between the two of them)\n\nI can only help with the offline~desktop version and with text adventure mode, as that is all that I've used so far, lol.\n\nI still use an older version of quest (540), but this shouldn't matter as I try to help you, hopefully...\n\nerr... I ended up just creating an example game for you, if you want me to help you do it yourself in the GUI~Editor, let me know, but here's the example game for you to study and play with (game code below ~ you can copy and paste this to a new game ~ ask if you need help on how to do this, or you can download the game .exe file, as an attachment, also, even further, below):\n\nif it won't load~open~start up (as you're likely using the most recent version), either I have the wrong version number coded in (ask and we can help you with how to change this) or you'll have to make a few changes to the code to make it compatible with your version, again, ask us and we can help you do this too.\n\n[code:3kpilsxi]&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

How you want to generate the &quot;number&quot; you'll use to &quot;call that specific person&quot;, I'll also be trying to explain some of these ways conceptually here as well, keep reading, hehe.<br/><br/>&quot;randomization&quot; is but one (though very useful) way to generate the &quot;number&quot;.<br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>you can use the above concept, or you can add slightly to it, to get a slightly different design-result:<br/><br/>(we're NOT using the &quot;randomization&quot; function here, instead, we're incrementing the number each time, for what the output will be, it'll follow a cyclical pattern)<br/><br/>Object: television<br/>Attribute: watch_count<br/>Attribute Type: int<br/>Value: 1<br/><br/>if (television.watch_count = &quot;1&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;FOXNEWS&quot;)<br/>} else if (television.watch_count = &quot;2&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;CNN&quot;)<br/>} else if (television.watch_count = &quot;3&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;MSNBC&quot;)<br/>} else if (television.watch_count = &quot;4&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;&quot;BBC&quot;)<br/>} else if (television.watch_count = &quot;5&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;C-SPAN&quot;)<br/>}<br/>television.watch_count = television.watch_count + 1<br/><br/>~OR~<br/><br/>switch (television.watch_count) {<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;1&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;FOXNEWS&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;2&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;CNN&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;3&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;MSNBC&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;4&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;BBC&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;5&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;C-SPAN&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>}<br/>television.watch_count = television.watch_count + 1<br/><br/>so each time we &quot;watch&quot; (Verb) the &quot;television&quot; (Object):<br/><br/>Old: television.watch_count = 1<br/><br/>television.watch_count (New) = television.watch_count (Old) + 1 (Value)<br/>television.watch_count (New) = 1 (Old) + 1 (Value)<br/>television.watch_count (New) = 1 + 1<br/><br/>New: television.watch_count = 2<br/><br/>Old: television.watch_count = 2<br/><br/>television.watch_count (New) = television.watch_count (Old) + 1 (Value)<br/>television.watch_count (New) = 2 (Old) + 1 (Value)<br/>television.watch_count (New) = 2 + 1<br/><br/>New: television.watch_count = 3<br/><br/>Old: television.watch_count = 3<br/><br/>television.watch_count (New) = television.watch_count (Old) + 1 (Value)<br/>television.watch_count (New) = 3 (Old) + 1 (Value)<br/>television.watch_count (New) = 3 + 1<br/><br/>New: television.watch_count = 4<br/><br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>if (television.watch_count = &quot;6&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; television.watch_count = 1<br/>}<br/>if (television.watch_count = &quot;1&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;FOXNEWS&quot;)<br/>} else if (television.watch_count = &quot;2&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;CNN&quot;)<br/>} else if (television.watch_count = &quot;3&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;MSNBC&quot;)<br/>} else if (television.watch_count = &quot;4&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;&quot;BBC&quot;)<br/>} else if (television.watch_count = &quot;5&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; msg (&quot;C-SPAN&quot;)<br/>}<br/>television.watch_count = television.watch_count + 1<br/><br/>~OR~<br/><br/>if (television.watch_count = &quot;6&quot;) {<br/>-&gt; television.watch_count = 1<br/>}<br/>switch (television.watch_count) {<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;1&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;FOXNEWS&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;2&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;CNN&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;3&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;MSNBC&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;4&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;BBC&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>-&gt; case (&quot;5&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;C-SPAN&quot;)<br/>-&gt; }<br/>}<br/>television.watch_count = television.watch_count + 1<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>alright, were you able to understand this too ???<br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/>Object: poolhall20<br/>Attribute: response_choice<br/>Attribute Type: boolean (boolean = flag)<br/>Value: unknown<br/><br/>msg (&quot;alright, were you able to understand this too ???&quot;)<br/>get input {<br/>-&gt; // quest engine will automatically set: result = user's typed-in input during game play<br/>-&gt; poolhall20.response_choice = result<br/>-&gt; If (poolhall20.response_choice = &quot;yes&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;GOOD JOB !!!! hehe <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->&quot;)<br/>-&gt; } else if (poolhall20.response = &quot;no&quot;) {<br/>-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;HK did a bad job, boo hoo.

(there's some differences and~or more~less features between the two of them)<br/>~AND~<br/>2. text adventure mode or gamebook~storybook mode? (there's some differences and~or more~less features between the two of them)<br/><br/>I can only help with the offline~desktop version and with text adventure mode, as that is all that I've used so far, lol.<br/><br/>I still use an older version of quest (540), but this shouldn't matter as I try to help you, hopefully...<br/><br/>err... I ended up just creating an example game for you, if you want me to help you do it yourself in the GUI~Editor, let me know, but here's the example game for you to study and play with (game code below ~ you can copy and paste this to a new game ~ ask if you need help on how to do this, or you can download the game .exe file, as an attachment, also, even further, below):<br/><br/>if it won't load~open~start up (as you're likely using the most recent version), either I have the wrong version number coded in (ask and we can help you with how to change this) or you'll have to make a few changes to the code to make it compatible with your version, again, ask us and we can help you do this too.<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;

You can NOT have two things with the same value for their &quot;Name&quot; Attribute, but we've got the &quot;Alias&quot; Attribute for &quot;naming&quot; things as we think of naming. Many things can have the same value for their &quot;Alias&quot; Attribute.\n\nfor example:\n\nObject (1)'s Name Attribute: orc_1\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Name: alias\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Type: string\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Value: orc\n\nObject (2)'s Name Attribute: orc_1\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Name: alias\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Type: string\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Value: orc\n\nthis would cause an error, as the quest engine doesn't know which &quot;orc_1&quot; you're refering to (such as in a Verb's scripting).\n\nObject (1)'s Name Attribute: orc_1\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Name: alias\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Type: string\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Value: orc\n\nObject (2)'s Name Attribute: orc_2\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Name: alias\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Type: string\nAttribute (1)'s Attribute Value: orc\n\nno error at all, as the quest engine only cares about &quot;orc_1&quot; and &quot;orc_2&quot;, and not &quot;orc&quot;.\n\n-----\n\nAFTER you name the attribute, then in the window (below the Attribute Name), there should be a small &quot;drop down box&quot;, click on it, to get the choices for the Attribute's Attribute Type: string, int (integer), double, boolean, string list, object list, string dictionary, object dictionary, and script dictionary.\n\nand AFTER you select the Attribute Type, then the Value box (below the Attribute Type box) changes to match up with what Attribute Type you chose.\n\n-----\n\nno, you're not a noob, this is confusing in-of-itself to new people, and on top of that, I didn't explain it at all (or I don't explain stuff well, if I do, lol).\n\nplease ask as you got any more questions, as it's easier to respond to a direct question, I can be more clear in my answer, lol.\n\n-----\n\nGAMES are (well, actually its optional) art... and *MORE*, lol\n\naspects of a game (a good game is a massive project, that takes years for a team of people who're pros-experts ~ know what they're doing! compared to us, who're just starting to learn how to do stuff, lol):\n\n(for an RPG anyways)\n\n1.
