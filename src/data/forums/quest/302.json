      "EditableText": "Hi, \n\nI been looking for a while for a text adventure creator that can work with multiplayer games over the net, and found Quest, which I'm pretty impressed with at the moment, although I haven't started using it yet. I have a few questions about QuestNet though...\n\n1. Will you be adding PayPal as a payment type for it? This is the only one that I would be able to use, well the only one I would use, especially seeing I'm in th UK.\n\n2. I guess I would always have to be the host of a game? I was wondering if there is any way of having it hosted remotly? I have broadband so it is no real problem for me, I'd just leave my PC on. But, I want it based around a website, how would I go about doing this do you think? Would I have to sort of schedule games or is it the sort of thing that people can join in at any time, mid game etc.\n\nI understand my questions, but you may not!\n\nThanks in advance\n\nSimon",
