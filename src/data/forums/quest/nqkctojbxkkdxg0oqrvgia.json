I got about 20 of those. HOWEVER, if none of them are typed, the game essentially breaks. after that point, no matter what they type, even if it matches my expression results, it doesn't register, and even gives me different text. For example, one of my options is WAIT, if they type it the first time, it gives them the text i want, if they type, for example 333, and hit enter, which matches none of my expressions, the game kinda breaks, but if they type wait in then, it says \"Time passes\". Which isnt a text i added, but imagine its somehow built into the engine.  im very confused, i want them to be able to type wrong answers, be told that doesnt work, and try again. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
