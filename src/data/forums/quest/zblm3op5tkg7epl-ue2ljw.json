There is a default function called `TestGarment` which always returns true, and the web editor doesn't allow you to modify core functions.\r\n\r\nIf  you want to do it using the web editor, your \"after wearing\" function would become something like:\r\n```\r\nif (GetBoolean (this, \"toosmall\")) {\r\n  msg (\"That is too small for you.\")\r\n  _DoRemove (this)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**OR** you could modify the `wear` command so that it checks before doing everything else. The online editor doesn't let you modify core commands, either, but you can change them during the game.
