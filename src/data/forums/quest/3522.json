      "EditableText": "Hello!\n\nI'm wanting to make a gamebook using Quest. I've figured out all the core-functionality (it's very easy to get to grips with) and I feel I could easily make a hyper-text work. But if I just wanted to make hypertext games, I'd be using HTML, or Twine if I was feeling fancy. What I'd like to be able to do is have choices set values which then unlock other choices at later dates. Variable text based on existing values would also be nice, but I guess not essential.\n\nSo, basically, what is the easiest way I can do this?\n\nCheers!",
