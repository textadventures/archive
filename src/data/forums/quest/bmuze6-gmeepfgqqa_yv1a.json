It will save the game while the 'Continue' link is still displayed, but, when loading the save, everything works -- the wait is simply cancelled by Quest.\r\n\r\nI realize that your game may have something scripted which makes it behave differently than my example game.  The only thing I can advise without seeing your code is to hide that Save button before a ```wait```, then show it again after the ```wait```.\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJS.uiHide(\"#cmdSave\")\r\nwait{\r\n  // Whatever your code is\r\n  JS.uiShow(\"#cmdSave\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere is a link to my test game.  Just click save as soon as it loads (without clicking 'Continue').  Then, load the save.  It should just bypass the wait when the saved game is loaded.\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ijkka-wgr0c8ykj_mzckfg/save-during-a-wait\r\n\r\n---\r\nDo you have a link to your game?
