So for example, the player sees:\r\n```\r\nMake a Choice!\r\n1. OPEN THE DOOR\r\n2. OPEN THE DOOR\r\n3. OPEN THE DOOR\r\n```\r\nAnd they select option 2. Is there a way to get different things to happen if you choose a different option? Ie OPEN THE DOOR 1 does a different thing than OPEN THE DOOR 2, even though they both give the same string 'result' variable?",
