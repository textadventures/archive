      "EditableText": "A common thing you need to do with an object list is filter it down to just the ones that have a certain attribute. It's easy enough to write a function to do that, but I always wondered why there's a `FilterByAttribute`, but not `FilterByHasAttribute` (or whatever you'd call it).\r\nI end up writing that function every time I start a new project.\r\n\r\nJust realised: `FilterByAttribute (AllObjects(), \"description\", null)` will find all objects that don't have a description. And the corresponding `FilterByNotAttribute()` call will find all objects that *do* have a given attribute. Because it uses Equal() to test, so a null value is the same as not having the attribute.\r\n\r\nMaybe this should be in the documentation.\r\nOr even, a little tweak to make the usage slightly more intuitive:\r\n```\r\n  <function name=\"FilterByAttribute\" parameters=\"lst, name, value\" type=\"objectlist\">\r\n    if (not IsDefined(\"value\")) {\r\n      return (FilterByNotAttribute (lst, name, null))\r\n    }\r\n    l = NewObjectList()\r\n    foreach (o, lst) {\r\n      val = GetAttribute(o, name)\r\n      if (Equal(val, value)) list add (l, o)\r\n    }\r\n    return (l)\r\n  </function>\r\n\r\n  <function name=\"FilterByNotAttribute\" parameters=\"lst, name, value\" type=\"objectlist\">\r\n    if (not IsDefined(\"value\")) {\r\n      return (FilterByAttribute (lst, name, null))\r\n    }\r\n    l = NewObjectList()\r\n    foreach (o, lst) {\r\n      val = GetAttribute(o, name)\r\n      if (not Equal(val, value)) list add (l, o)\r\n    }\r\n    return (l)\r\n  </function>\r\n```\r\n↑ With that little change (if I understand the rules right), the user could call `FilterByAttribute (somelist, \"someattribute\")`, omitting the third attribute to get a list of objects which have (or don't have) an attribute regardless of value. I think that's a fairly natural thing for a programmer to assume would be possible, so it would be nice to have it Just Work.",
