I gave a friend my IP address, set WinXP Firewall to allow Questnet through on port 10001. I can connect to my Questnet instance locally but she cant get to me. Didnt work with Telnet adapter either and I checked that was enabled too. We were on  MSN so I was able to check my IP and help with her settings. \n\nAm I missing anything? Do I need to specify anything in the game itself to allow this? She got 'could not connect to remote host' on telnet and no error at all using Quest - it just hung there trying to connect. \n\ntia,Matt",
