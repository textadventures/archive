I found out how to add the library but i don't know how to use it. I want the npc to talk to the player and then the player can pick from a list of responses and the npc will reply differently for each selection. anybody have any clues?\n\nsecond question:\n\nIs quest written in basic? I want to know which coding language i should try to learn first so i can work more in depth with quest\n\nThirdly:\n\ndoes anyone have any cool gamebook tricks? I think it's so cool they give you the option to make them but it seems like even though it's easier to figure out than the text adventure option it's a little limiting as to what can be done with it",

If you have specific questions, ask on that thread, and it will keep them all together for anyone else trying to work it out.\n\nQuest uses three languages, including XML (and it is proper XML). If you click on tools - Code view you will see the XML. It also uses Javascript, but unless you want to do fancy stuff with the interface, you can ignore that.\n\nThe important one is the one used in scripts (click on the Code view icon, seventh along, for a script), and that is unique to Quest. It is kind of similar to C++/Java and many of the built-in functions come from Visual BASIC.",
