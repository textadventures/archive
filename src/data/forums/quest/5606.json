      "EditableText": "For me, it kind of depends how many items you want to take off of the NPC.  1?  10?  Is the NPC always asleep?  Or does the NPC fall asleep?\n\nIf it is an awake and a sleeping NPC (which I assume it is), I would make two NPC characters.  Whatever triggers the NPC to fall asleep - just add a script that removes the awake NPC (and his objects) from the room and the sleeping one to the room (and a second set of his objects).  And vice versa for whatever event that wakes the sleeping NPC.  If you try to take objects from the awake NPC, simply put in the inventory tab under 'take' something like &quot;You dare not take that from the NPC if he is awake!&quot; and under the 'take' for the sleeping NPC add a comment like &quot;You quietly take the object from the sleeping NPC.&quot; and add the object to your inventory.\n\nThere are other ways to do this, but for simplicity's sake, I believe this to be the easiest.  Just copy everything and move object and NPC from/to room.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.  If you need me to, I will supply sample code for it.\n\nGood luck.\n\nXanMag",
