A good example of this would be applying something to the player's body, such as suncream on a beach.\r\n\r\nI'd want it to have multiple options (right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg, etc) but I also want it to _not show_ (**alternatively, telling the player that clothing is in the way would work too**) options depending on whether the player is wearing certain clothing. \r\nExample given: Give the option to put suncream on the player's back, but that option doesn't show provided your character is wearing anything that, well, conceals their back.\r\n\r\nCurrently my idea is to use flags for whether or not the bodyparts are concealed and have each clothing specify which part it conceals, and then work with that - have the choice menu checks which of these flags is on concealed or not, and then give the choices. Example given: A shirt conceals the back and stomach area, a bikini would not.\r\n\r\nHow exactly would I need to go about this when using the drop-down menus?\r\n\r\nApologies if this question is fairly rudimentary - albeit I have a general idea on what I want to make thanks to months of thinking, I only really started to try and work with Quest quite literally yesterday.\r\n\r\nFor context: I am making a TextAdventure (TA), on the windows desktop app.",
