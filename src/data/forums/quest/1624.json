That way you could do:\r\n$objectproperty(#(quest.currentroom):north#;alias)$ to get it..\r\nAnd it would return a NULL ('!') if the direction didn't exist.. And a '0' if the direction held a script (or even 'script' being returned?).\r\n\r\nEither that, or you could have a function called &quot;direction&quot; or &quot;exitname&quot;.\r\n\r\nalso, the built-in variables.. #quest.doorways.dirs# is EXTREMELY hard to parse if you want to write your own exit description.\r\nCan we not have a plain comma-separated list too? Like with the &quot;formatroom&quot;/&quot;currentroom&quot; variables?\r\n\r\nPerhaps, even have an array which goes from 0 to 8. This then get's populated as follows:\r\nindex[0]: Holds the information on a comma separated list of index numbers.\r\nindex[1-8] holds the names of the rooms which are in those directions. 1 being north, 3 being east, 5 being south and 7 being west (the ones in between are obvious).\r\n\r\nSo, for instance #quest.dirs[0]# could hold: 1,3,4,5\r\nthis could be parsed and so:\r\n#quest.dirs[1]# = &quot;street&quot;\r\n#quest.dirs[3]# = &quot;river&quot;\r\n#quest.dirs[4]# = &quot;nightclub&quot;\r\n#quest.dirs[5]# = &quot;toilet&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is also a challenge going out to anyone: can you get a list of the names of the exits without going through each room and adding in a list of properties?\r\n- I don't like doubling the effort.",
