You can't put a break, or it will show up in the game.\nThat creates an issue (especially in code view) because you have to put all the HTML into one line of text. I'm currently working on improving the 'twohalves' thing, and the start script looks like a jumble of random words and numbers. Although it looks and works great in-game, the HTML itself is extremely dirty.\n\nThe way I see it, there's 2 options:\n[list=1:1cdmjcf5][*:1cdmjcf5]Re-implement the 'insert' function (which seems like it would be counter-productive) or[/*:m:1cdmjcf5]\n[*:1cdmjcf5]Make a new function specifically for HTML, without including a separate file, and without throwing it all into one line[/*:m:1cdmjcf5][/list:o:1cdmjcf5]\nOf course, I'm pretty sure there's a way to inject HTML from a file right now, but that takes away the whole purpose of the msg's HTML functionality.",
