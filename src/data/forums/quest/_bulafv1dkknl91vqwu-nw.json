      "EditableText": "> If the player attacks a monster without a weapon equipped, you get this error message:\r\n\r\nAnswer at the bottom. But I think it makes more sense for me to explain how I go about finding it. That way, you know how to solve similar problems in future.\r\n\r\nOK, the error in this case is that it can't find a function with the signature <code>Replace(<b>Object</b>, String, String)</code>. If you've read the docs, you know that the signature of the Replace function is <code style=\"color: green\">Replace(<b>String</b>, String, String)</code>.\r\n\r\nSo, the first argument passed to Replace is of the wrong type - it's an object, and it should be a string.\r\n90% of the time, if a variable is an object and it shouldn't be, this is because it's the special object `null`.\r\n\r\nThe first parameter in this case is in the variable `s`. So if you search in the library code for that line (it's in the function AttackReport), and scroll up to find where `s` is set, you'll find your problem. In this case, `s` is the first parameter of that function.\r\n\r\nSo, somewhere in your code, the function `AttackReport` is being called with the first parameter being either `null` or another object. So next we search the code for where `AttackReport` is being called from.\r\n\r\n`AttackReport` is called to the function `DoAttack`. Its first parameter is either `weapon.critdesc`, `weapon.attackdesc`, or `weapon.missdesc`.\r\n\r\nThe attributes `attackdesc`, `critdesc`, and `missdesc` should all be strings. It's unlikely that you would have accidentally set one of them to be an object. So the most probably answer is that you have a weapon on which some of the attributes `attackdesc`, `critdesc`, or `missdesc` are missing.\r\n\r\nNow, this happens when the player is unarmed. So what is `weapon` when the player is unarmed? `weapon` is the second parameter to `DoAttack`, se we need to look through the code to find out what the second parameter is when the player is unarmed.\r\nIn the attack command, you have this code:\r\n<pre><code>  if (<b>player.equipped = null</b>) {\r\n    DoAttack (player, <b>player</b>, object)\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    DoAttack (player, player.equipped, object)\r\n  }</code></pre>\r\n\r\nSo, when the player is unarmed, the variable `weapon` is the player object itself.\r\n\r\nMost likely (unless there's some other code interfering with it that I haven't seen), **this error means that your `player` object doesn't have string attributes named `attackdesc`, `critdesc`, and `missdesc`.**",
