Give the player a script attribute named `changedcurrentmap`, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (not HasAttribute (this, \"alternatemaps\")) {\r\n  this.alternatemaps = NewDictionary()\r\n}\r\nif (IsDefined (\"oldvalue\")) {\r\n  if (not oldvalue = null) {\r\n    if (DictionaryContains (this.alternatemaps, oldvalue)) {\r\n      dictionary remove (this.alternatemaps, oldvalue)\r\n    }\r\n    dictionary add (this.alternatemaps, oldvalue, Grid_GetPlayerCoordinateDictionary (this))\r\n  }\r\n  this.grid_coordinates = null\r\n}\r\nif (DictionaryContains (this.alternatemaps, this.currentmap)) {\r\n  this.grid_coordinates = DictionaryItem (this.alternatemaps, this.currentmap)\r\n}\r\nGrid_Redraw ()\r\n```\r\n\r\n(not properly tested, but I think that should allow you to do something like `player.currentmap = \"Earth\"` or `player.currentmap = \"space\"` to clear the map and replace it with a new one, but save the old one so that you can go back to it later. Note that if you go from Earth to space and then back to Earth at a location the player hadn't previously visited, this will have the same problems as teleporting from one room to another on Earth.
