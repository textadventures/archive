NPC1.fate = 3 and NPC1.fatetrigger = false)\n\nI want that when some NPC fate gets to 10 it will trigger a script and set fatetrigger to true. This I know how to do. But I also want to trigger the script  after certain time limit (lets say 10 minutes of game play). Then I want to check which NPC has a highest fate and trigger right script.\n\nI could do this by writing &quot;If NPC1.fate &gt; NPC2.fate and NPC1.fate &gt; NPC2.fate and so on&quot; then I would have to duplicate this six times. And again six times untill all fates have been activated. Also I don't want to trigger any fate twice (so if someone already has attribute &quot;fatetrigger = true&quot; they should not be included in the comparison.\n\nAnd when lastly when all six &quot;NPC.fatetrigger = true &quot; I want to end the game. So there is 60 minute time limit to the game.\n\nWhat is the easiest way to do this whole thing?",

If yes and the attrib is true it increases a counter. If the counter is equal to the number of NPCs, it finishes the game. If the attrib is false it compares the fate with the last found value. If it is greater it saves this value. After the loop you have the object with the maximum fate and you can call another function",
