Technical issues aside, that sort of confusing ambiguity led me to abandon it. I'm curious to see how it works for you when you give it a go. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

Then make a command 'out' which leads out and set up your exits appropriately. Then if you wish 'back' can be a simple alias to the room you were last in.",
