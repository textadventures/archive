However this new knife does not display in the players inventory, not on the side gui, nor when the player types &quot;i&quot; or &quot;inv&quot; in the main description window. So the player now has an invisible knife (knife2) really, which he/she can drop, and pick back up and use, but never see it.\n\nIs this a bug? Anyway around this?\n\nThanks,\n\nS",
