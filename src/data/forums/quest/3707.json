I'm making a gamebook type game, if that makes a difference.\n\nI know that for the game itself, I can simply click &quot;play&quot; and play through what I have, but what about the title page- with the description and everything- that one sees before beginning the game? (it would be convenient, however, if I didn't have to play through to the page I want to see every time I need to see how it looks)\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
