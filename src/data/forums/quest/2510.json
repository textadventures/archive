That creates a conflict when you type 'Kiss wife' because 'wife' is also contained withing the #text# wildcard. Testing this out, it seems to ignore the &quot;Kiss wife&quot; command script entirely, but that might be because I have that lower down the list of commands. I can't seem to change the order in the list of commands, so is there any other way of creating a priority where there is a conflict?\n\nAgain, apologies if the tutorial covers this and I've missed it!",
