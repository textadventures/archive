      "EditableText": "I think the easiest way to do it would be to use the 'limited containers' thing.\r\nIf the player has a `maxobjects` attribute, it specifies the maximum number of objects they can pick up.\r\n\r\nIf you give the player a `maxobjects` of 2, then you can only hold 2 objects.\r\nIf you set the player's `maxobjects` to 3, that lets them carry 2 objects plus a backpack… which is probably close to what you want.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be able to drop the backpack, you could give it \"take\" and \"drop\" scripts that adjust the player's maxobjects accordingly. Or even a simple `changedparent` script.\r\n\r\nOr if you're using \"advanced options for wearables\", you could make the backpack wearable and give it the attribute modifier `maxobjects+1`. That means that the player can carry 2 objects before they get the \"You can't  carry any more items.\" message; but wearing the backpack gives them space for 1 more (effectively meaning that the backpack doesn't take up a slot when it's worn).\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense; I'm answering without Quest open, and can't quite remember where all the options are in the editor or how they're labelled.\r\n\r\nNote: If using this method, any scripts you've written that add an object to the inventory will be able to take the player over the limit. So if an NPC is giving something to the player, for example, you would need to check that the player's hands aren't full. It would end up looking something like:\r\n```\r\nif (ListCount (GetDirectChildren (game.pov)) < game.pov.maxobjects) {\r\n  msg (\"John gives you the {object:bell}.\")\r\n  AddToInventory (bell)\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  msg (\"John tries to give you the {object:bell} but your hands are full, so he puts it down next to you instead.\")\r\n  MoveObjectHere (bell)\r\n}\r\n```",
