I hope it's okay I put all of it in a new forum topic:\r\n\r\nI have decided to use the Conversations library (ConvLib) to add a conversation with a character.\r\nThe players are shown 4 topics they can choose from/click on.\r\n\r\nHere's what I'd like to be able to:\r\n\r\n1: I want two of the topics to require that the player has 5 or more points before they can click of those two topics.\r\n\r\n2: And where do those points come from? Well, the player has to ENTER how many points he or she has when opening the game. I'm build a board game where the players earn points, and then they scan a QR-code that opens the Quest-page/game. Here, they enter how many points they have earned. And then, when they are presented with the 4 conversation topics (see #1) the script will make sure that if they click on a topic that requires 5 or more points they are given an error message.\r\n\r\n3: And, as mentioned in my previous post, \"Add-on to a board game\", it would be great if, every time the players open a conversation topic, an hour (-1 hour) is subtracted from a total of 10 hours. And when the player has used his 10 available hours there is a message saying \"You have run out of time.\"\r\n\r\nAny help with this would be amazing.\r\nThank you,\r\nCarsten.",
