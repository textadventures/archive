If you do everything properly, it should be nigh-impossible to get any PC assembled after 1990 out of memory with a plain text adventure.\r\n\r\nI guess the issue lies in the direct link library, or one of it's dependencies then. Have you modified it (or anything related to it) in your game? The best way to get such errors is having some sort of recursive or otherwise faulty code at a place where the compilers and usual fail-safes don't catch them.\r\n\r\nElse, your CefSharp.Core could be glitched for whatever reason, downloading Quest again should fix this.\r\n\r\nCan you give any more info on the issue though? Especially as it isn't _alyways_ happening, as you described it.",
