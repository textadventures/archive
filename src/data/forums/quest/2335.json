The original verb is &quot;hit,&quot; and I want to set the synonym &quot;collide.&quot; It works fine when players type &quot;collide [object],&quot; but I need it so they can say &quot;collide WITH [object].&quot; I set the synonym &quot;collide with,&quot; but it doesn't recognize it when you type it in the game. I have a feeling I'm not doing this right but I'm not sure what to look up in the documentation. \n\nDoes anyone know how to set a conjunction along with a verb?",
