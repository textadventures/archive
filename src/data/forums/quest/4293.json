      "EditableText": "So, I want to put something like &quot;paint&quot; into my game. So when the player has it in its inventory, the player can type &quot;paint #text# on *object*&quot; (I thought I would put 4 walls, a floor and a ceiling as objects in the rooms, but any other object should be &quot;paintable&quot;). The text is some message or a description of a picture, or just any bullshit the player types in. And after that is done, if the player looks at the object, the text should be displayed.\n\nI guess, changing the &quot;look&quot;-attribute does the trick, but I don't know how to change the value to the text the player types in. Any suggestions?",
