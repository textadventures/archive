      "EditableText": "The game I am working on, you are essentially stuck at home for 24 hours. What I would like to do is create an in-game time system, where a minute goes by every 10 seconds. With a system like this, I'd like to be able to do time-related things, such as changing the ID of the video I have a television set to play every 30 in-game minutes (5 minutes), change the time on a clock when you look at it (of course), and end the game once the 24 in-game hours are up. I have a feeling that this can be done, and I've tried experimenting with timer scripts, but I can't seem to find any method that works.\n\nPerhaps someone before me was able to pull this off, or would know how to? Any and all help would be appreciated.",

      "EditableText": "What you need is two separate elements. The first would be an object attribute that holds the value of the time. The second would be a timer with a script that changes the value of the attribute every x seconds. I would try something along the lines of the following:\n\nCreate a new object called master_clock or something similar.\nCreate 2 attributes on it, &quot;hours&quot;, and &quot;minutes.&quot; Make them both integers and set them to 0.\nCreate a timer called clock_control. Check &quot;start timer when game begins,&quot; set the interval to 50 seconds, and enter the following script.\n[code:vj4weqin]master_clock&#46;minutes = master_clock&#46;minutes + 5\nif (master_clock&#46;minutes = 60) {\n  master_clock&#46;minutes = 0\n  master_clock&#46;hours = master_clock&#46;hours + 1\n}[/code:vj4weqin]\nNow when you want to reference the time in your other scripts, you can refer to exact time periods when something happens. You can also add further if () { scripts to the timer to trigger certain things. e.g. A script using if (master_clock.hours=13 and master_clock.minutes&lt;31) { would allow something to happen between the game times of 1pm-1.30pm.\n\nThis is a simplified version that updates the in game time in 5 minute chunks rather than 1 minute. It also assumes you'll be using 24 hour time starting at midnight. Changing this starting point to whatever time period suits your needs should be relatively easy, you'd just need another script or two to make sure it ticks over from 2359 to 0000. Using the master_clock object also allows you to add other attributes you might want to create and use like changing to a 12 hour clock with AM/PM, assigning qualitative descriptors like morning, afternoon, evening etc., or even adding something like changing weather at different times of the day.\n\nHope this helps, if you need further clarification of any points let me know.",
