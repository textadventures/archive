Scenery can't be examined, basic commands aren't understood and typing LOOK doesn't reveal the whole room description, just a couple of lines (you have to scroll back up to see mention of the pipes and gears). There's absolutely no hint as to what the player should do or even any background to explain why you're locked in a cell. Locked in a cell games have been done to death before and much better than this. Making a game difficult is one thing, but first and foremost it should be worth playing.",
