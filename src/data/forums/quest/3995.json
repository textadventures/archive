      "EditableText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI just started using this tool last night, and I'm looking for a little assistance with my ending. I am trying to have 23 lines of text (typewriter effect) appear after opening the final safe, in addition to a picture and sound effect playing. Currently the sound and picture are working fine.\n\nHere's the issue with the text: I have each line set to start at a 10 second interval from the last line, and the first line starts 10 seconds after the last action is made (the same one that prompts the sound/picture). For whatever reason, the game is either not calculating the 10 second intervals right, or is skipping lines entirely. On last test, I lost 8 out of 23 lines, and some lines started while others were still typing out even though nothing should overlap with the large interval I set.\n\nIt goes like this...\nAfter opening the object:\nShow picture: surprise.jpg\nPlay sound: TARDIS sound.mp3\nAfter 10 seconds, run script&#058; typewriter @50 ms\nAfter 20 seconds, run script&#058; typewriter @50 ms\n(x23)\nAfter 230 seconds, run script&#058; finish the game\n\nSome lines are set to type slower than others, but they're all 10 seconds apart. I originally tried embedding each typewriter action within the script before it, but then it wouldn't do it at all. Really appreciate any veterans help, as this is a very personal project for me, and is intended for only one person otherwise I would share for anyone to test and critique.",

And you can't coordinate several typewriter outputs. Using timers doesn't make sense because the timers are different in the offline and online player. You must rewrite the Javascriptcode for this effect in a local routine and when the text is printed to the screen, you can send a message to your aslx code so that you can start the next typewriter line",
