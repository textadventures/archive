I want to be able to search this Phrase string to see if the player typed in any specific words.\r\n\r\nFor instance, let's say I'm looking for \"sword\", \"wand\", and \"shield\". I want to use a function to search the Phrase string for any of these terms. If the function finds any of the words I'm looking for, I want it to return true so that I can execute a unique event based on the matching string.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, how can I condense my if statements for this function? For instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (Phrase [contains] \"sword\" or Phrase [contains] \"rapier\" or Phrase [contains] \"stabby thing\") {\r\n(do sword-related thing)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIs there a way to condense all those or's into one thing?",
