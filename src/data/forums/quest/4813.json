Now, the game maker, can code in stuff to handle this, but otherwise, the person playing is helpless to deal with it.<br/><br/>the reverse is somewhat the same for using #text# instead, as YOU CAN type in the alias, but then you got to check if the Object exists and if it does, then to actually 'GET' that Object, as your input for #text# is just a String, when you want to act upon or to (need to) use the actual Object for what you want to do. You can see this coded for in my code in my post above (Credit goes to Pertex, as he gave~crafted this bit of code to~for me when I was working on my Combat Code, based off of Pertex' Combat Library's structure).",
