My idea was to create an \"Empty\" object which would be not droppable nor usable in any way. Then I thought to use some kind of change script to check if the inventory is empty everytime it updates. If so, I would add the \"Empty\" object. Then, whenever the player takes something, I would remove th \"Empty\".\r\nI am missing the part of the change script, I cant find an \"inventory attribute\" on the player object to work with.\r\nPlease, anybody have an idea how to solve this?",
