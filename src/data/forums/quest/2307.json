I hit the +IF button at the top to change it to an If statement, define my statement, hit OK.\n\nAt that point, soon as you hit OK, take your hand off the mouse and stare at the screen.\n\nThe script Editor window shows a blank IF... statement in the list of statements at the top, with the If Then Else windows filled in for whatever you just built.\n\nBug: If you hit the +IF button again, rather than coming down a line to create another If statement for you to build, it wipes out the current one you just built.\n\nBug: If, rather than hitting the +IF button, you click the Add More &gt; button in the lower right-hand corner of the dialog box, you get a new default print message window.  You don't want a print message window, you want another If statement.  So without clicking anything anywhere else, you click the +IF button, an empty Print &quot;&quot; message is created with a new If statement below it.\n\nBug: If, to prevent the above, you hit OK after creating the first If Statement (and you're staring at the blank If... message at the top of the screen)\n       ... then click Add More &gt; to create the next statement (it's a new default print message)\n       ... then click the new blank statement's line where it's listed in the top statement window\n       ... then click the +IF button, it STILL creates a blank Print &quot;&quot; and forces a new if statement in a new line.  At the least, you've having to go back and delete extraneous blank statements.\n\nYou should be able to hit the +IF button, create your statement block in the script editor window, hit OK, hit +IF again, and it takes you down to a new If statement line, not wipe out the one you've just created.  I thought it was just me not knowing what to click when, but every combination I try fails to advance the +If to the next line.",
