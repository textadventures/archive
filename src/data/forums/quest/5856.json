Recently, I've undertaken a project quite different to what I usually make, using lots of images and sound.\n\nNow what I've ended up with is a game that can't be uploaded to the Quest website, and as game files seem to only work on a computer with Quest Game Maker installed, it means I'm not going to be able to really show it to anyone, unless I can convince them to install Quest and take the file.\n\nWhat would be ideal for me, is a text game making engine, or whatever it is that you'd call Quest, that can create a file that doesn't need anything else installed. A standalone game. An engine that is both friendly to pictures and sound, and would run as close to Quest does as possible.\n\nI don't think I'd ever replace Quest as my main go to for making these games, but for this project, could anyone recommend a suitable alternative for Quest?\n\nOh, something to note would be that this project was made in Gamebook mode, and doesn't require complex functionality. Only that an image, some text and sounds/music can be on screen simultaneously.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nSerban",
