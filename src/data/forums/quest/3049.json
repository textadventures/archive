Obviously he can not talk and sing at the same time... and then when the conversation is done and after about 10 seconds of you not interacting with the NPC he starts to &quot;sing&quot; again, thus the music starts again both from scratch and or from the last note (Or from where the sound file was paused at.) he was on before you interrupted him?",
