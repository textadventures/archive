      "EditableText": "Hi.  As I work out some limitations in the default code and add those to my personal editor, I have to wonder how these fixes might propagate into a released version of Quest?  (ie light sources in an inventory do not light up a room, that seems like an obvious oversight that should make it to release)\nDo others have to wait for the next version to reap the benefits? (other than updating their own copy of Quest)\nSeems like there should be two kinds of updates:  Game Engine (C#/java) improvements and ASLX file improvements.  The later could be updated and made public much more often than the former.\nI'm stil new here so forgive my possible ignoramity.\nthanks",
