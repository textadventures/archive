      "EditableText": "I'm not sure why that would freeze. But the most obvious issue is the expression `obj + \"(\"`. You're adding an object to a string, which probably isn't what you want. I suspect that code should be:\r\n```\r\nmenulist = NewStringList()\r\nforeach (obj, GetDirectChildren(Weapons)) {\r\n  weapon = GetDisplayAlias (obj) + \"(\" + obj.melee_dmg + \" dmg)\"\r\n  list add (menulist, weapon)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nso that you're displaying the alias of the object, rather than the object itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still isn't perfect. Once you've done the `ShowMenu`, your `result` variable will be something like `\"knife (15 dmg)\"`, which will be hard for your code to deal with. This is why the `ShowMenu` function allows dictionaries. You could use something like:\r\n```\r\nmenudict = NewStringDictionary()\r\nforeach (obj, GetDirectChildren(Weapons)) {\r\n  weapon = GetDisplayAlias (obj) + \"(\" + obj.melee_dmg + \" dmg)\"\r\n  dictionary add (menudict, obj.name, weapon)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nin that case, if you pass `menudict` to the `ShowMenu` function as a list of options, it will show the alias and the damage, `result` will just be the *name* of the weapon. So in the code within the menu, you could do something like `weapon = GetObject (result)` and then you have an object variable you can use to examine that weapon's attributes.",
