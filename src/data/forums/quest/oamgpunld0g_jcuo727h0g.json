Also, if there were more than 1 object in the room, is it possible change the room description further to include both of those objects? Sorry if I'm asking too much.",

The descriptions of objects will be added to the end of whatever room they're in.\r\n\r\nIf you want a specific description for when an object is not present; or if you only want the description to appear in a particular room, you could do that with the `here`/`nothere` text processor commands.\r\n\r\nFor example, a room description could be:\r\n```\r\nThe field is just an open expanse of grass. There is {nothere bull:{nothere sign:nothing particularly interesting to look at}}{here sign:a {object:sign} in the middle of the field warning \"beware of the bull\".  It seems pretty pointless, as by the time you're close enough to read it{here bull: your attention is dominated by }{nothere bull:, it is clear that there is no bull in sight.}}{here bull:a massive {object:bull} charging towards you}.\r\n```\r\nObviously, in that example I've got quite a lot of the `{}`, because there's a bunch of very different things it can say. In most cases, unless the objects interact with each other, it might be simpler.",
