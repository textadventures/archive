      "EditableText": "So I have a bit of an... interesting query here. You know how Quest lets you include HTML links? Well, I was trying to find out if local links worked too, so I found out how Quest references files like images using HTML tools, and I tried to use &lt;a href=&quot;quest://local/testpage.html&quot;&gt; (I am using the display message command, so all of this is being put within a &lt;span&gt; element). No dice. So then I tried to just copy the same image link and try to use an &lt;a&gt; element with it. Also no luck. So then I thought, maybe I can use an iframe? So I tried making an iframe with the same address, and it worked.\n[attachment=2:1zbsnyjk]<!-- ia2 -->visual1.png<!-- ia2 -->[/attachment:1zbsnyjk]\nThen I decided to use an actual online page to test it (since I know that http:// links work). I used my old school's website as a test. And it worked, too.\n[attachment=0:1zbsnyjk]<!-- ia0 -->visual3.png<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:1zbsnyjk]\nI downloaded the page to test it locally. I put it in the game folder, typed the appropriate address, and here's where it gets strange...\n[attachment=1:1zbsnyjk]<!-- ia1 -->visual2.png<!-- ia1 -->[/attachment:1zbsnyjk]\nIt just displays the raw HTML. Weird.\n\n...In summary, I just want to find out how to create a link from within the game's folder.",
