I wanted to make a container (in this case a bottle) so that you could type in &quot;empty bottle&quot; and remove whatever object is in it without specifying the object.  Is there a way to do that?\n2. Is there a way to limit a container to holding just one object?  Obviously if I have a bottle of water, I shouldn't be able to put a piece of cheese in the bottle along with it.\nThank you. (:",

      "EditableText": "1. You can write a loop script that will find each object inside your container - that is, each object that has a &quot;parent&quot; property of &quot;bottle&quot;. In the loop script, unset the parent property. Here's an example to show you what I mean:\n\n[attachment=1:1fxm9ohx]<!-- ia1 -->empty.asl<!-- ia1 -->[/attachment:1fxm9ohx]\n\n2. This isn't built-in behaviour in Quest 4, but you can set it up using scripts. On the Container tab in QDK you'll see you can have a custom script run whenever you try to add or remove an object to/from a container, so in this case we can just use a numeric variable to keep track of how many objects we've added, and manually add the object using a script only if there is enough space.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n[attachment=0:1fxm9ohx]<!-- ia0 -->limited container.asl<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:1fxm9ohx]",
