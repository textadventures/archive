Right now I'm trying to figure out how to change an object's description after I give it an object from my inventory. I'm sure it involves an \"if\" script and setting a flag, but I don't know how. If it's hard to do with the interface, I just might not bother.",

      "EditableText": "Actually, it is very simple. I do not have the Quest installed right now to make a step by step for you, but I'll do my best from the top of my head, because I did it in past once.\r\n\r\nMy intention was having a character that, during the game, had a description and after the player finding a secret, had a different description.\r\n\r\nI created the \"Object\", which was the NPC and filled it up with all the stuff I needed. Then, I went to the NPC's attributes and creted a new attribute which was a boolean, what means, a flag. A boolean or flag is a variable with only two states: True or False. I set it to false.\r\n\r\nDuring the game, when the player finds the secret, the game runs the command 'set flag', name of the flag, then to \"true\". In code it would be something like 'npc_name.secret = true', but if yu are not writing code, the GUI already has this command in the variables section. I decided doing this for a matter of organization, but you can actually use this \"set flag\" command on the fly, creating it as \"true\" at the moment the player fnds the secret.\r\n\r\nNow, comes one of th best features in Quest, in my opinion. You may use the text processor to do script things for you. So, the NPCs description had two different descriptions: One for the {IF npc_name.secret = false: Show the regular description}. The other was {IF npc_name.secret=true: Show the secret description}. Every time the player used the \"Look at\" command on the NPC, the game checked if the secret was true or false, delivering the adequate description in game.",

Then give the object a ball taken from elsewhere in the room and is in your inventory, which shows text acknowledging the ball has been taken and removed from inventory. After that, I want it so if you look at the object again a different picture is shown along with text. What do after setting boolean attribute to false?",
