When using a script (not text), I have put: \r\nadd page link from page.... to page .... with link text...\r\n\r\n I have completed it with two existing pages and my link text is \"look up\" however for some reason the link isn't appearing in the game. \r\n\r\nI've gone back to my previous gamebook and have noticed I've used exactly this before but have had no problems. There is no error when played the link just simply doesn't appear.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your help!",
