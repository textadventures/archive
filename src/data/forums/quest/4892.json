On the planet of Gor, there are very defined gender roles, and as such male and female characters would have a different experience. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to change certain things based solely on the player's gender chosen at the beginning. If you look at the game script, you will see where I am trying to change the caste set for a female vs. a male character. Obviously I have gone awry somewhere and any help would be greatly appreciated because I am incredibly stuck.\n\nMany thanks in advance!  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
