      "EditableText": "> Is there a way of making a animal or person follow you around everywhere you go in the game?\r\n\r\nThere's a script which runs every time the player enters a new room; I'm not sure if it's on the 'Scripts' or 'Advanced Scripts' tab of the game object. You could use this to move another character into the same room, after checking for any conditions that would make them start or stop following.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, yuou could use a turnscript (which runs at the end of every turn) to have an NPC move towards the player if they are able to do so.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, you would probably need to display a message to say that the new charactr has arrived, or the player might not notice.\r\n\r\n> Also can you give items to another person in the game\r\n\r\nI believe Use/Give is a feature which needs to be enabled on the Features tab. You would need to write a script for the person to accept the objects you are giving them, but it should be fairly simple.\r\n\r\n> and be able to list what items they are carrying?\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to show what a person is carrying is to make them a surface or a transparent container. In this case, looking at the person will show what he is carrying. In the case of a surface, the player will also be able to take things from them.",
