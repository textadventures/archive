The point of a ubiquitous item is that it is there in the background all the time. An example to illustrate the problem: \n\n[quote:2c1uuju1]You are in a big room.\n&gt;examine wall\nYou can't see that here.[/quote:2c1uuju1]\n\nIt is a room, of course it has walls. But the author really cannot be bothered to add a wall object to every room. So... add the wall as a ubiquitous item. One way to code a ubiquitous item is to have one item that follows the player around, and to do that you you need to override the OnEnterRoom. Alex has made this very easy.\n\nClick on &quot;Filter&quot; at the bottom left of the window, and select &quot;Show Library Elements&quot;. In the left hand pane, you will see a whole load of functions appear, in gray. Look through for &quot;OnEnterRoom&quot; and click on it. Across the top, in the right pane, you will see a message that this is a library function, and to the right, a button &quot;Copy&quot;. Click on that, and you get your own OnEnterRoom in you game file, and this one will be used rather than the library one.\n\nNext create the items. You might want to put them in a room you create just for this purpose to keep them together. Each one needs &quot;scenery&quot; ticked, and a description.\n\nThe OnEnterRoom function fires each time the player enters a room, and handles displaying the room description. What we will make it do is move any ubiquitous items into the room. You can do this selectively, perhaps you only want walls in some rooms, and trees in another. We are goinmg to do this in the code view.\n\nThe function definition starts like this:\n\n[code:2c1uuju1] &lt;function name=&quot;OnEnterRoom&quot;&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;[/code:2c1uuju1]\n\nFor an item that is present in every room, just add a line just after the one avove to move the item to the room.\n\n[code:2c1uuju1]    MoveObject (wall, player&#46;parent)[/code:2c1uuju1]\n\nFor other things, they might not always be present. I would guess it is unlikely the player will type &quot;examine tree&quot; in a cave, so you may feel it is easier to have all the objects there. \n\nI feel it is better to just move the relevant ones. How you do this depends on how you set up the rooms, but let us suppose all rooms in the forest start &quot;forest_&quot; (so there might be &quot;forest_east&quot;, &quot;forest_inner&quot; and so on). We can test for the name starting like that, and move the tree accordingly.\n\n[code:2c1uuju1]    if (StartsWith(player&#46;parent&#46;name, &quot;forest_&quot;)) {\n      MoveObject(booth, player&#46;parent)\n    }[/code:2c1uuju1]\n\nHere is another example, for putting clothes into the room. If there is a male character, then the mans_clothes object is dragged in, for a woman, womans_clothes. Note that this is not going to work properly if there are two characters in the room (only one will get clothes).\n\n[code:2c1uuju1]    char = FindChar()\n    if (char &lt;&gt; null) {\n      if (DoesInherit(char, &quot;female&quot;)) {\n        MoveObject(womans_clothes, player&#46;parent)\n      }\n      else {\n        MoveObject(mans_clothes, player&#46;parent)\n      }\n    }[/code:2c1uuju1]\n\nTo get this to work, you need to add this function which will return a character in the present room, or null if there is none.\n\n[code:2c1uuju1]  &lt;function name=&quot;FindChar&quot; type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;\n    list = ScopeVisible()\n    return (null)\n    foreach (obj, list) {\n      if (DoesInherit(obj, &quot;male&quot;) or DoesInherit(obj, &quot;female&quot;)) {\n        return (obj)\n      }\n    }\n  &lt;/function&gt;[/code:2c1uuju1]",
