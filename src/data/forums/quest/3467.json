I've run into some problems that I was hoping someone could clear up for me.\n\nPlease note that I am using the web version of Quest. I work from a Mac and can't install the offline program. So I can't use the code view (I think).\n\n1) How do you create a list? I would like to give the player the option to choose from several &quot;specializations&quot; (basically classes) via a pop-up menu, but I can't figure out how to create a list.\n\n2) Is there a way to use walkthroughs in the web version of Quest? If there is, I can't find it.\n\nThose are the two most pressing issues right now. I may have more questions later. Thanks in advance!",
