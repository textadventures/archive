I was thinking \"no\", because that one seems to be two separate \"pieces\" (header/label and main text area?) whereas the \"Custom Status\" pane is just one \"piece\"?\r\n\r\nMy example code above produces a pane that looks a fair bit like the main Status window but lacks:\r\n* Blue line dividing the header/label from the info below.\r\n* The lower part of the pane (\"box\") is the same as the upper (label) part, whereas in the main Status one, it appears to be pure off-white (in the default theme, anyway).\r\n* The font size looks very slightly \"off\".
