      "EditableText": "Hi there. I want to create a text adventure game but ive had a look at quest and it doesnt seem to support characters( i.e giving objects, movement etc) .  I know you can script in quest and i guess you can do this but isnt this a bit tedious. I would have thought a good program like quest would have something like this but it doesnt seem to have support for characters. Also in quest can you change the screen interface to how you want. ie can you get rid of the arrows (compass) on the screen and change the screen to how you want it to look. In other words can you get rid of quest captions and replace them with your own.  And thirdly i want to create a game and send it to a friend. Can he play it independantly without having to purchase any thing to do with quest or can he play it without getting the basic quest package.  I want him to just double click on a file to run the game without using quest.  Also what are your opinions of quest.  Do you think it is a good adventure builder.  I also have C.A.T (Creative Adventure Toolkt) and T.A.B(Thin basic adventure builder).  These programs look really good and character support is included.  What do you think is better??? Shall i use CAT(which has character support) to make an adventure game or would quest be a better option. Many thanks guys. Happy gaming!!",

      "EditableText": "Hello Stants,\n\n I know I may not be the best person to answer your question as I'm slowly getting into quest myself and thus don't know a lot about it like the others. I shall however do my best to give you information on what I know. Quest does have &quot;give&quot; and &quot;use&quot; options for objects. When you create an object at the top, it will say:\n\nSetup, Inventory, Container, Advanced\n\nClick on Inventory, and the at the bottom you'll find you can edit the &quot;give&quot; and &quot;use&quot; commands. You can even set up to use an object on it's own. So, if for instance it was a lighter. The player could type &quot;use lighter&quot; and print something like &quot;You click the lighter and nothing happens. You'll need lighter fluid before you can use it.&quot; As for movement, I I've added into my game myself:\n\nWalk to\nWalk over to\nGoto\nGo to\n\nIt's not all that bad, but It would be nice if it was already in quest. \n\nNow, to answer your last question. You want to create a game and send it to a friend, so that he play it independently without having to purchase any thing to do with quest. This was made possible with Quest Pro v4.1.0. Alex included a packager that you could use to turn your asl into a setup.exe file. This is awesome because you can create stand alone games! My experience with quest has been very good. You can always come here for help if you need it, and once you've purchased it, when the latest version comes out, you don't have to purchase it again.\n\nHope I helped you out at least a little bit.\nStevo",
