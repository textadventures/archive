Could you explain to a novice why that doesn't do the job?[/quote:3o9sh08k]\nGladly.\n\nBasically, JS.eval takes a string and converts it into regular JavaScript.\nExample:\n[code:3o9sh08k]JS&#46;eval (&quot;alert('Hello, world!')&quot;)[/code:3o9sh08k]\nThis would make a popup message saying 'Hello, world!'\nHowever, if you wanted to do something more complex, like this for example:\n[code:3o9sh08k]function randomFunction(param1, param2) {\n    ASLEvent (&quot;OutputText&quot;, &quot;Param1&#58; &quot; + param1 + &quot;, Param2&#58; &quot; + param2);\n}\n// This basically means that if you use the JavaScript function 'randomFunction(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)', Quest will print 'Param1&#58; hello, Param2&#58; world'[/code:3o9sh08k]\nThat wouldn't be possible in a library currently, as you would have to have a way to put it all into a string, but the only way to do that right now is to remove the line breaks. Imagine if you have a lot of line breaks though. That would take a while -- not to mention attempting to edit one huge line of JavaScript!\nOf course, it is possible if you create a new object in the library and give it a JS attribute or something, but that's not very efficient.\n\nDoes that make any sense to you? <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
