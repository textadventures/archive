      "EditableText": "Would it possible to include an 'open notebook' command, which would act as kind of inventory, in which you've recorded names, codes, etc, that could be triggered at any point in the game?\n\nLet's say right at the start of the game you type 'open notebook'. I would like the response to be something like &quot;Plenty of old notes and scribbles, but nothing relevant from this case.&quot;\n\nBut then as you progress through the game, having been given names, codes, objects... 'Open notebook' would then simply act as an inventory and list anything I've decided needs to be recorded?\n\nSecondly, could real time be incorporated? You start the game and type, &quot;time', this prints the response (for instance) 15:00. Twenty minutes later (in real time) you type the same command and the message, 15:20 is printed. Could that be done?",
