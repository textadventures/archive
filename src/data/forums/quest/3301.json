I was really, really liking the ease of using Quest until I came across a couple problems.\n\nI'm trying to make a HIGHLY interactive game, so I was expanding the number of verb synonyms. I was able to make &quot;Lay on&quot; (accounting for the common grammatical mistake people would likely use) act as 'lie on', but when I tried to expand the synonyms that would act as 'eat', (chew on being one), suddenly the game insisted &quot;on&quot; was a part of the object name and therefore wasn't recognizing any object starting with the name &quot;on&quot;.\n\nMy second problem... I start the player off wearing pajamas. which are mentioned in the player's description. The pajamas are stained with blood, but i want to allow for specific interactions with the stains irrelevant to the clothing itself. So I made 'blood stains' also an item on the player. But the problem arises when I make &quot;bloody pajamas&quot; or &quot;blood stained pajamas&quot; one of the synonyms for the pajamas. And despite making 'blood' a synonym for the stains, when i choose to 'examine blood', I can only look at the pajamas and not the stains.\n\nCan this be fixed while still allowing the level of interactivity and account for all the possibly things someone might type?\n(Please do not bother to mention the fact that my game is wholly empty at the moment, or criticize my 'priorities' in making people able to chew on tables before there's even a second room, because these points are both irrelevant to the situation.)",
