The trick is to somehow export object state from the game, but just the object or objects (or object attributes) that you want. You then need to also be able to import that save data into the next game.\n\nIf you had a limited number of state choices (or attribute values), you could encode the attribute/state info into a string that would then be pasted into the next game as input. Some (non-Quest) games with very limited state have used code words. You might need more than that.\n\nIt might be worth discussing again. Having it server-based might be a solution, as you could use some sort of Ajax call to put and get the state info.",

Or, are the stats the player could end game one with far too complex for that?  If you possibly have a dozen or so different end game builds, I think that is how I would try to accomplish that.\n\nYou could add a 'Get input' command after a question like &quot;if you have a password from the previous game, please enter it now.  If not, please enter 0 now.&quot;  And have a code like es5a2i8c6 presented from the previous game that calls an &quot;elf&quot; player with stats of 5 strength, 2 agility, 8 intelligence, and 6 charisma.  You would then obviously need to gather the players name again at the beginning of the sequel.  I guess it all depends on how many different combination builds you have.  Just a thought.  Good luck.\n\nEDIT:  Ha.  I re-read Jay's post and saw he basically mentioned what I said above - just in a way more intelligent sounding way.  =)",
