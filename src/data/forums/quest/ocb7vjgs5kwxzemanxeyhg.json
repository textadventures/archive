So, if you copied and pasted all of that, you have to go back and change it all after you modify ```DoAttack()``` to allow for weapons, which happens towards the end of that page of the tutorial.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n# FROM [THE TUTORIAL](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/The-Zombie-Apocalypse-(on-the-web-version))\r\n\r\n>Finally, we need to change other places where we used ```DoAttack``` so they have the new parameter (which should be ```false```). In the attack command, the last but one line now needs to be:\r\n>\r\n```\r\nDoAttack (player, player.equipped, object, false)\r\n```\r\n>\r\n>In the turn script, the sixth line needs to be this:\r\n>\r\n```\r\nDoAttack (obj, obj, player, false)\r\n```\r\n>\r\n>Finally, the tenth line of ```SpawnZombie``` (and any other spawn functions) should be changed to:\r\n>\r\n```\r\nobj.displayverbs = Split(\"Look at;Attack;Shoot\", \";\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n## PERSONAL NOTE\r\n\r\nWhile following one of The Pixie's tutorials, when I get to a point like this -- where I have to go back and change code I've already written, I get a little frustrated.\r\n\r\n...but I do definitely learn (and remember) more things from Pixie's tutorials than any other tutorials I've ever followed.\r\n\r\nSo, I bet you think I'm about to say, \"the good outweighs the bad,\" but no.
