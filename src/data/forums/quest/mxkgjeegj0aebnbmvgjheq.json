Everytime you talk to her, the only thing she asks is: whats my name. \r\nWhen you finally figured out her name and return to the girl, is it possible to answer her question and then end the game when you have the right name? \r\n\r\nThe only way I can come up with this is using verb with the object (the girl) and then run a script. The only problem is that when using the verb, you have t type the name and then the objects name behind it. ",
