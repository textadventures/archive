      "EditableText": "I did that experiment for the online demo where I created an attribute with a double value and then printed that value every turn.  The period always prints as a comma (online only).  So I figured that if I can't get the web player to do such a simple operation right, using doubles online is probably not going to work.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I can do away with double attributes altogether and instead double the numerical value of each unit (integer value) that the player moves in one turn; i.e., if you move north 1 space, the y coordinate will change by 2 units.  If you move northwest 1 space, the x coordinate will change by 2 units, and the y coordinate by 1 unit (instead of .5 units).  This was not ideal though, since if you move north one space, the room name will change from \"area500_500_0\" to \"area500_498_0\".  I wanted a more intuitive feel for the map movement.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, I realize I could halve the units moved and then add that to the new room alias so it will display properly to the player.  This would entail a two-tiered coordinate system -- a coordinate system that Quest uses based on integers that uses the room name, and one that the player sees based on doubles that uses room aliases.  This is doable but might create complications down the line.  Anyway, I'm too tired to fool around with this anymore!  I can provide the code and someone else might want to make improvements...",

      "HTML": "<p>I did that experiment for the online demo where I created an attribute with a double value and then printed that value every turn.  The period always prints as a comma (online only).  So I figured that if I can't get the web player to do such a simple operation right, using doubles online is probably not going to work.</p>\n<p>As a workaround, I can do away with double attributes altogether and instead double the numerical value of each unit (integer value) that the player moves in one turn; i.e., if you move north 1 space, the y coordinate will change by 2 units.  If you move northwest 1 space, the x coordinate will change by 2 units, and the y coordinate by 1 unit (instead of .5 units).  This was not ideal though, since if you move north one space, the room name will change from \"area500_500_0\" to \"area500_498_0\".  I wanted a more intuitive feel for the map movement.</p>\n<p>As I write this, I realize I could halve the units moved and then add that to the new room alias so it will display properly to the player.  This would entail a two-tiered coordinate system -- a coordinate system that Quest uses based on integers that uses the room name, and one that the player sees based on doubles that uses room aliases.  This is doable but might create complications down the line.  Anyway, I'm too tired to fool around with this anymore!  I can provide the code and someone else might want to make improvements...</p>\n\n",
