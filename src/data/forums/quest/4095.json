I have some nice MIDI tunes I would like to use in a game, but it seems that I will need to convert them to wav. As far as I can tell, this would make them huge files, which I would like to avoid if possible.\n\nIf the tunes have to be wav. then does anyone know of a way of compressing RIGHT down?\n\nThanks for any advice.",
