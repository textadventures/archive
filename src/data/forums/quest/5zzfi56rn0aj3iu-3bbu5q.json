      "EditableText": "Heya all, bit of a strange question today: Trying to name clones.\r\n\r\nIf I have an NPC factory and it has a command where the player can generate NPCs called Bob (or any other object, really) eery time the command is used, the object Bob is cloned. I'm sure the way Quest works this means you get a Bob1, Bob2 or something along those lines. It's always the same Bob, with the same functionality and such.\r\n\r\n But then, my question is making them have a different name.  So the ```get input``` can be used to  give the Bob a new name. Say the player uses the command, gets their very own Bob and wants to call it Harold or Gzztsg. And then they hit again, the Bob2 object comes out but we want the player to be able to rename is John or PrincessSparkelle. I know how to change an alias, as I've already got the player picking their name, but is there a way to reliably be able to give a cloned object a chosen name each time?\r\n\r\nLong story short, is there a way to easily change the alias for an object's clone each time it's made?\r\n\r\n**Bonus Question:**\r\n\r\nFurther on the subject of ```get input```, say you give the player a choice to enter something like pick their sex, male or female. And they enter, being players, 'cat'. Cat isn't either male or female, so of course this screws up the whole thing. Player will get a message saying something along the lines of, \"That's not an acceptable sex, try male or female.\"  But then I need to repeat the function that they've just screwed up, or they're left hanging at a screen.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this mid-script? For some clarification, the player's character creation runs as a start script for the game itself, so it already has the intro play, pick eye colour, skin colour, hair colour, etc, then choose their sex. The only way I can think of it being able to be repeated is to have it as a function and recall it. Is this the best method to do, or is there some way to... Go back a turn in a script?
