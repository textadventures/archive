Somewhat like this:\r\n\r\n-When you enter a room, there is about 80% of nothing happen or 20% of an event happening.\r\n\r\n-Then if an event happens, there is 10% chance of event A, 30% chance of event B or 60% chance of event C.\r\n\r\nHow would I program something like this? Specially if I plan for more events all with different chances.",
