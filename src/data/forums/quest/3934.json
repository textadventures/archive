I've attached my game file with a test room that will show what I'm describing.\n\nThe room has a player, two containers (barrel and bowl) and two objects (apple and orange).  For the apple all I did was add put to the inventory verb list.  For the orange I added the put verb (with a script) to the object.

I selected disable automatically generated display verb list for this object.\n\nFirst the apple.  With the links  if I select apple-&gt;put it says, &quot;you can't put it.&quot;  I do not get a list of objects to select from, which I would think would be the default behavior.  If I type &quot;put apple&quot; it says, &quot;you can't put it.&quot;  If I type &quot;put apple in barrel&quot; it says, &quot;done&quot; and moves the apple.\n\nNow the orange.  If I use the links I can select put (it provides a list of objects) and can put it in the barrel, but not the bowl.  Which is according to my rules, and I get 10 points.\n\nIf I type &quot;put orange&quot; I then get a list of objects and when clicking on an object everything works as it should.\n\nIf I type &quot;put orange in barrel,&quot; it puts the orange in the barrel, but does not give the points.  If I type &quot;put the orange in the bowl&quot; it allows me to do so, but according to my rules it should not allow this.    I presume it is using the default verb instead of the one I created.\n\nI would think the links and command line for the apple should act the same.  Ditto for the orange.  Is this behavior a bug or a feature?  Also, I would think put should be part of the use/give tab since there will typically be an object required.  I have not played with use/give yet so don't know if this would solve the issues.\n\nI presume the solution is to modify the default verb, but also wanted to raise the issue of the inconsistencies in behavior.",

I'm not really sure how a pattern of just &quot;put&quot; works (usually it would be something like &quot;put #object#&quot;), but there must be something built into Quest to flesh out the pattern. \n\nNow, there is also a default *command* for put, which has pattern &quot;^put (?&lt;object1&gt;.*) (on|in) (?&lt;object2&gt;.*)$&quot;, which means it matches things like &quot;put apple in bowl&quot;, &quot;put apple on bowl&quot;, &quot;put orange on apple&quot;, etc, but not something like &quot;put apple&quot;. So when you use the &quot;in&quot; variant, it is matching that command and bypassing your code altogether.\n\nIf you change your verb to this, then it will override the command:\n\n[code:1h7ohk47]  &lt;verb&gt;\n    &lt;property&gt;put&lt;/property&gt;\n    &lt;defaultexpression&gt;&quot;You can't put &quot; + object&#46;article + &quot;&#46;&quot;&lt;/defaultexpression&gt;\n    &lt;pattern type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;^put (?&lt;object&gt;&#46;*) (on|in) (?&lt;object2&gt;&#46;*)$|^put (?&lt;object&gt;&#46;*)$&#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/pattern&gt;\n  &lt;/verb&gt;[/code:1h7ohk47]\n\nTo do that in the editor, click on the verb, change Pattern to &quot;Regular expression&quot; instead of &quot;Command pattern&quot;, and then input:\n\n^put (?&lt;object&gt;.*) (on|in) (?&lt;object2&gt;.*)$|^put (?&lt;object&gt;.*)$\n\nThis will force both cases to go through your verb. You do need to actually provide a &quot;put&quot; implementation for the apple object, though. Otherwise, it's not put-able, regardless of what the display verbs say.

Also, maybe it's the &quot;pattern&quot; attribute being set~added within the Verb Element, that connects it with the Command Element too, for them to both work...
