However I have found something that might want to be addressed in the next addition.\n\nWhen you create a flag 4.0 remembers it in a handy pull down menu for easy use later (thank GOD for that, big improvement).  However, the pull down menu makes everything lowercase and the flags ARE case sensitive.\n\nFor example, if you want to have a differant room description for the bathroom you might use a flag.  Lets say that after the player enters the bathroom the first time the flag &quot;bathroomD&quot; is turned on.  When you are coding, the pull down menu will show you &quot;bathroomd&quot; and you will select it because that is the one you made before.  IF you do this, the code will not execute unless you manualy go back in and change &quot;bathroomd&quot; to &quot;bathroomD&quot; yourself.  (or you could change the first code, either way something has to be changed).\n\nThis is a rather minor thing but I thought I would bring it up.\n\nThanks,\nDr.Froth",
