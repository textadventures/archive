Do you agree?\n\nWhy do I think this? Well, they were implemented in the days before you could add alternative names to an object, and before you could specify multiple commands in one &quot;command&quot; tag. Now that we have both of these features, I struggle to see what use they are in new Quest games, which is why I propose deprecating them for v4.0.\n\nAny comments?",

If there are multiple objects in the game which can be typed several different ways, then instead of making an alt name for each object, it's easy to just make synonyms. Let's say you have 'stairs' for instance. You can just set up a list of synonyms such as 'steps, step, stair, ramp' instead of having to do that for each stairwell object.",
