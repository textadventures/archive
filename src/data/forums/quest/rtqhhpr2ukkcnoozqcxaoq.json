For example, the sabre's code goes as follows: ```set (sabre1, \"type\", \"sabre\")```) With these applied, if the player tries picking up something too quickly after entering a room (it doesn't have to be one of those items,) instead of the output printing ```\"You pick it up.\"```, a blank new line is added and the item doesn't go anywhere. The object then remains this way until the player restarts the game.\r\nI've tested it with these attributes removed, and the problem goes away. Is there a more efficient way of handling custom variables like this that I'm unaware of? Any help would be much appreciated. Ah, also, I'm using the web version of Quest, if that helps with solving this problem.",
