      "EditableText": "This drives me absolutely crazy, so your help is much appreciated.\n\nI plan on sharing a couple of my games on other sites.  I first wanted to update a VERY small part of X1.  I created a new picture for a puzzle and replaced the old one.  That's all.  That file is minimally sized at 171KB.  I went to publish the game and it went from 9.03MB to ~53MB.  I realize what is happening here (I think).  In converting everything to a .quest file, other files in the same location were bundled with this new picture.\n\nIf I were to move all X2 pictures out of this shared location and republish, I assume the file size would shrink to its original 9-ishMB.  But, if I do that, wouldn't that mean if I wanted to republish X2 at some point down the road I would need to go back into game and relink ALL my pictures?!  Argh!  \n\nAm I wrong?  Is there an easier way to rearrange these files without jumbling up the location of the others?!  \n\nAnd for future reference... if, when starting a new game, should I create a new folder and then save all images/sound files associated with that game into that folder?  Currently, I have all of my files basically in a few scattered folders based on their extension types.\n\nEDIT:  I guess I don't really understand how things are bundled when creating a .quest file (and forgive me, I know this has been mentioned before on the forums).  I think I only have one image and no sounds with X1.  So, I took that one image and put it all by itself in a neat little folder on my computer labeled 'X1 images' thinking that when publishing, it would only pull stuff from that folder, but the file size remains at 53MB...\n\nHell, I just 'Saved as...', created a new file name and saved the .aslx into the X1 folder with the ONLY other file associated with the game, published it, and it is now 55MB!  Sorry if I'm an idiot, but this seemed like an easy fix.  Hopefully it is and I'm overlooking something obvious.   <!-- s:x --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" /><!-- s:x --> \n\nThanks!\n\nXanMag",
