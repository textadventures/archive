I apologize if this is something glaringly obvious that I've glossed over.\n\nThe specific examples I have in mind are as follows;\n1. I don't want to use the Command Bar at all, but it's required if I want the player to be able to input things for the purpose of 'Wait For Player Input', such as naming the character. Is there a function to turn it on and off? Or is it possible for me to make one on my end? As it stands, my options are leave the command bar on, when it's not really being used for anything, or turn it off but lose the ability to have the player name things.\n2.  I'm using the map system, but it would be nice to be able to turn it off during encounters with npcs and enemies, as it would make things a lot cleaner; during these encounters, the map is irrelevant information that takes up a fair portion of the window.\n3. I'm drumming up a system of self-contained menus for encounters and the like; in addition to disabling the map window, it would also be useful to just disable the interface entirely. Get rid of the compass, for example, which would save me the bother of checking to see which exits are within the player's reach, locking them, then reopening them upon the end of the encounter, as I don't want players moving rooms mid fight. Getting rid of the inventory pane would prevent them from using an item and messing up the function chain I'm using for the encounter.\n\nThat's about all I can think of for now, at any rate. Multiple questions, but all of the same theme. I'm really hoping this is possible, as it'll save a lot of headache. In summary - is it possible to turn the Command Bar, Compass, Places and Objects and Inventory UI's on and off through functions during gameplay?",
