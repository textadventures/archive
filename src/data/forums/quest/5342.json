Well, what i want is:\n\nGive to the player like 3 min to reach the destination and then add the time left to the score\n\nOr:  add more points if the player choose the short route\n\nExample:\n\n(all the game happen in a offices building)\n\nIf the player call for the intercom and say &quot;i am here&quot;, to then go to the guard -who will offer him the  key- and then the player go to the office, then he use the faster route\n\nBut if he try to ask the key to the guard before using the intercom he will be delay because the guard make a long call to see if the player work in the building. \n\nThe thing is that the player can be a lot of things to be late. Like press the wrong number in the intercom . And i  want that all actions can change the score.\n\nAh, and of course: end the game if you dont reach the office in time\n\nHelp! I have no clue :/",

Add a new message to the timer &quot;the guard gets off the phone and lets you in&quot; and use a move object player to building.  Of course you can do anything else you want here like unlock exit instead for example, or have any number of things happen.
