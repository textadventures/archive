When you speak to characters, there are several options to choose from, and depending on what option you choose, the character responds differently and you can say something else.\n\nThat is what I am trying to achieve on a base level. My text adventure is a lot more action based as opposed to exploration based. For instance, the game is set in a steampunk setting and you are the captain of an airship. At one point, you encounter a dust storm in which you are given three options:\n[1] Fly through it\n[2] Fly around it\n[3] Fly around with full speed engaged (costs fuel)\n[4] Wait it out\n...And depending on which option you take, events play out differently. Also, earlier in the game, you have the opportunity to buy equipment which can help you in these situations - I plan to have the game read the set flags to determine whether you have an item which would help you in any scenario.\n\nSo if you could help me, I would be really, really appreciative. I know it's much to ask, but if you could make a quick game where there are at least two of these situations, I would very much appreciate it so I can see what you've done.",
