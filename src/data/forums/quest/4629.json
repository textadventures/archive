So when you have two rooms and you create an exit from one to the other, then look at the room and find that exit. If you click on it, you can set whether it's locked or not by default.\n\nAlso, if you give it a name, then you reference it in scripts (specifically the &quot;Lock exit&quot; and &quot;Unlock exit&quot; script commands).
