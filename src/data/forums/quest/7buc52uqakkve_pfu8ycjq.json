(Something is not quite right in that location.)\r\n\r\nI want it to act as if the needle were just spinning around (slowly or quickly, either way).\r\n\r\nI have thought of two ways to handle this:\r\n- An animated GIF, which has a layer for each compass direction.   (Each layer would be a screenshot of the compass pane, with only one direction available.)  I would use JS to replace the content of the actual compass pane with this GIF while in the room.\r\n- Use a ```setInterval()``` with an ```ASLEvent()``` in JS to call a function which makes the available exit invisible and makes the next exit on a list visible.  (I'm thinking this one isn't a great plan.  And I think I'd need to set the interval at 60 seconds, to keep from upsetting Quest.  (I think 60 is the safe interval.  I know I read that 1 second is not good.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm leaning towards the GIF.  None of the exits will actually be available, anyway.  So, it seems like the second option would be overkill.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any thoughts or suggestions?",
