It gives lots of javascript errors, is this normal? \r\nHere's a screenshot: http://imgur.com/18zISpC\r\nIt doesn't seem to restrict the game - but when I export  the game as a .quest file and run through the \"QuestJS\" converter, and then preview in a browser, I get another javascript error - this time though it's really not working as intended. It looks very different. The initial information doesn't show, and all you get is a textbox. Here's a screenshot of that running on my computer's localhost: http://imgur.com/3y3ZnHi\r\n\r\nI'd like it to work locally just as it does online, I'm planning on converting this to an app using phonegap build. \r\nAll help appreciated, apologies if I'm doing something stupid!
