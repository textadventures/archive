      "EditableText": "For the past few days, I've been trying to implement a firearm into my game. I've looked on the forums several times, but can't find any replies or tutorials that solve my problem. Here's what I'm trying to do:\r\n\r\nThe gun begins the game loaded with 6 bullets (a full mag of 5 and one in the chamber). I want the player to be able to fire the gun randomly into the air with the \"fire\" command, thus losing a bullet, or shoot a zombie/animal and also lose a bullet. There's only one gun, so no need for equip commands. The player will automatically re-load the gun if he has a mag with him. The guns do not do damage, they just kill in a shot.\r\n\r\nI want to be able to _**script**_ the gun, not mess around with the code.\r\n\r\nHere's what the attempted script for when the player types the command \"fire gun\" currently looks like:\r\n\r\nIf: Player is carrying object - object - gun\r\nthen:\r\nIf object attribute equals - object - gun - attribute: clip = gun.clip > 0\r\nthen:\r\nset variable: gun.clip = expression gun.clip - 1\r\nPrint message: You fire the gun\r\n\r\nelse:\r\nPrint message: You fire the gun\r\n\r\nIf it helps at all, this is the message I receive in game when I attempt to fire the gun:\r\nError running script: Error compiling expression 'gun.clip = gun.clip > 0': CompareElement: Operation 'GreaterThan' is not defined for types 'Boolean' and 'Int32'\r\n\r\nAny help you can give me will be very much appreciated :)",
