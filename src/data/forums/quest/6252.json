All the new flag does is allow me to change the room descriptions depending on if the curtains are opened or closed, so I doubt they would have any barring on shutting the curtains after they are opened. I used the same technique for a lamp in another room and it stays switched on, or switched off. I even have a &quot;closet door&quot; in the same room as the curtains and that scripting works fine. It's absolutely identical. Maybe I should just switch the curtains to a &quot;switchable&quot; instead of openable/closeable.\n\n[quote:1tbj8rcf]Quest will set and unset it for you - it is the definitive attribute on the state of a container.
