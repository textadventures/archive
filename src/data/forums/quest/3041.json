So if you have a script that loops until the variable i = 10 or until another condition is met, simply add code to the section where the condition is met that changes i to 20 and it will exit the loop prematurely.\n\nNot sure if I explained it in a way that makes sense, but I've used it since his suggestion and it works well.",
