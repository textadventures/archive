It's a pretty threadbare library as far as functionality goes.  You can:\n\n1. create a list or lists on any object\n2. add an item to the top or bottom of a list\n3. remove an item from a list - either every instance of that item, or only a particular occurrence (ie, only the second time it occurs in a list)\n4. remove the first item of a list\n5. remove the last item of a list\n6. empty a list\n7. delete a list from an object\n8. see if an item exists in a list\n9. remove an item at a particular position in a list\n10. count how many items are in a list\n11. count how many of a particular item are in a list\n\nThe documentation shows you how to iterate through the items in a list on an object.

The documentation for the Lite version shows you how to do everything you've mentioned, I think.

I thought I had already done that, but it appears I didn't save the changes.\n\n[quote:1n2b37pi]..

For getting the first instance of an item, performing actions with/on it, then getting the next instance and repeating - I do have a scheme for that, but it's not coded yet.  Will definitely be included in the full version.  The same scheme will also be available to step through all the items in a list without having to use a for-loop.

With this implementation you can embed lists within lists to create any n-dimensional array you want.  The arrays can be [url=http&#58;//msdn&#46;microsoft&#46;com/en-us/library/hkhhsz9t(VS&#46;80)&#46;aspx:1n2b37pi]jagged or rectangular[/url:1n2b37pi].  Looking at it a bit differently, you can implement a tree structure (of any depth) and use one procedure recursively to discover all the items in the tree.  (Recursion was fun to figure out.  I had to use a list (a stack) in order to achieve it.)",
