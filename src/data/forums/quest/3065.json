A student has a game where there is a map in a newspaper.\n\nThe map needs to &quot;appear&quot; when they turn to Page 4.\n\nThey have made the newspaper as a container\nThey have the map in a hidden container with a command to move it across to the newspaper\n\nThey dont however want to &quot;Open&quot; the newspaper but instead &quot;Read&quot; it.\n\nThey have made up a Read verb and written a script which gives out a message at different times as though they were reading the newspaper.\n\nWhen they get to Page 4 they want the map to be listed as Page 4 is opened. I can sort of do it using the Open command but they are adamant they want to use Read. Enclosed is the script thus far.\n\nMany thanks in advance.....",
