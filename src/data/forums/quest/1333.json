I'd like to know this as I'm about to make the combat system for HavenHold, and having come up with several ideas I'd like you know what the masses want.\n\nNote: I really don't like the first option, even though it is the simplist, as I'm going for realism in my game.\n\nAdvantage system: Basically as you fight you and your opponant lose and gain advantage points (AP), which is like a measurement how how good you're doing. If you/enemy hit enemy/you or dodge an attack you gain AP, if you get hit or miss you lose. So if you attack some one much better than you, you will lose quickly as they dodge your attacks and hit you hard. 'Turns' would be given to the fighter with the most AP, like if you're getting attacked and hit lots you can't ignore that, turn around a fight like normal... But if the other starts to miss then you will get a chance at attacking. Obviously there will be a cap on max and min AP allowed...\n\nAlso if you have another idea let me know...",

It'll be private, so you'll need to sign up for it by telling me you're interested. I HOPE to get it out before my birthday as a kind of present to myself for all my hard work since late last year, my coding skills were very poor then and there were several failed game attempts, but that's all behind us now and my skills are up there will the elites.\n\nMy birthday is 33 days aways, so wish me luck!!\n\nIf you wish to help, please let me know, you name [i:96wblb3p]will[/i:96wblb3p] go on the credits, I promise.
