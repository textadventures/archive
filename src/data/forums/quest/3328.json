You could leave the room description blank and instead write the room description as a print message command under the &quot;When entering the room for the first time&quot; script section.\n\n2. You could change the room description drop down from text to script, and then write a script that only displays the description once. Something along the lines of:\n\n[code:32zqjnxk]\nif (room&#46;descriptionRead = false) {\n   msg(&quot;This is my room description!&quot;);\n   room&#46;descriptionRead = true;\n}\n[/code:32zqjnxk]\n\nI think the syntax is correct there.
