The bugs are just sounds not working, can't pick up objects that I know you can (like the rock in the room you start in, I tried it online and would not work but works offline) scripts not running and not adding material when it should just a lot of bugs that seem to be hashed out in editing mode but when you launch it theirs just a lot of problems. Oh another one is the ponds I have it to show water when looked at but didn't work in the online mode but worked fine in editing mode. Not sure why or if I have to many functions and other things but I don't think so, but if I do then im sol on this game cause I had planed to make it pretty big with separate hunting grounds and different biomes this is just me trying to hash out my crafting system. I know your real good with this stuff Jay can you give me advice on how to put it together better not do it for me just some advice on things you see wrong in the scripting or a better approach to adding functions or what ever will be very appreciated. Back to the core combat I took it out like I said it played no role just never took it out.[attachment=0:uxwu7siv]<!-- ia0 -->Craft Island.aslx<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:uxwu7siv]",
