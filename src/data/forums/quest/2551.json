Turning left again will display an other description like &quot;In front of you you can see a table. There is a door (exit).&quot; \nYou would have to disable the right panes and add an new attribute to all objects to define its position in the room. Player must have an attribute where his direction is stored. New commands &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;back&quot; and some more scripts and it should work",
