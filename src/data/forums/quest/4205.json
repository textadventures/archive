      "EditableText": "You don't have to do anything, it is not stored anywhere permanently and should have no effect on future scripts that are run.\n\nTo explain in more detail, there are 2 types of variables, local variables and global variables. \n\n- A global variable is something that exists permanently in the game, e.g. an attribute of an object is a global variable. An object called &quot;brick&quot; might have an attribute called &quot;weight&quot; set to a value of 20. A script that has the expression brick.weight will always be 20 no matter where you insert it in the game.\n\n- A local variable is something that only exists temporarily in the current script that is being run. In your case, you've set the variable &quot;outcome&quot; to be either a 1 or a 2. The later parts of your script use the variable &quot;outcome&quot; to describe that number, but if you were to reference &quot;outcome&quot; in another part of the game, Quest wouldn't know what you were talking about (unless you set another variable called outcome in that script).\n\nEven though you don't need to do this for the example you gave, all you need to do to wipe a variable is to set it to null, i.e.\noutcome = null\nor\nbrick.takemsg = null\netc.\n\nFurthermore, if your concern is about the player repeating the action that causes the script to run, because outcome is set to GetRandomInt at the beginning of the script, the 1 or 2 will be freshly randomized every time the player performs that action. So again, there is nothing extra that you need to add.",

I hope<br/><br/>so... conceptually:<br/><br/>if (choosen string list item~topic = script dictionary key~word item), then do that script dictionary item's msg script&#058; blah<br/>if (StringList: dragon = ScriptDictionary: dragon), then do ScriptDictionary: dragon 's script, ie msg: blah blah blah<br/>if (dragon = dragon), then do ScriptDictionary's dragon's script, ie msg: blah blah blah<br/><br/>&quot;match comparisons&quot; (if string_1 = string_2 ~ if dragon = dragon) are a huge part of the tactic~logic~technique of doing things in code<br/><br/>5. which gets us to the complicated part, the removal (or the addition of ~ which I'm not going to cover right now) of topics to select from:<br/><br/>let's say we've got some topics that we want to remove (one-time topic events) and some topics that we don't want to remove (repeatable topic events)<br/><br/>thus we must craft a function correctly, to deal with this complexity<br/><br/><pre><code>Our Function (slightly more complex), and~or Direct Verb (a custom one, so we don't mess up the built-in Verbs, let's call our custom Verb, for example, &quot;chat&quot;, lol) Scripting (simplier&#58; just put the below code as the script block for your Verb) of, let's say for example, the Object &quot;wise_owl_npc_your_helpful_guide_through_this_game&quot; (lol)&#58;<br/><br/>// we need to do this, to check if there's still topic choices in our string list&#58;<br/><br/>result_1 = ListCount (global_data_object&#46;topic_string_list) - 1<br/>if (result_1 &gt;= 0) {<br/><br/>// we need to do this, to get the current string list size, to get the random choice from that current selection of list choices&#58;<br/><br/>  result_2 = StringListItem (global_data_object&#46;topic_string_list,GetRandomInt(0,result_1))<br/><br/>// we cause the the script to run for the choosen topic&#58;<br/><br/>  invoke (ScriptDictionaryItem (global_data_object&#46;topic_script_dictionary,result_2))<br/>        <br/>// and now the beginning of the removal of topics proncess&#58;<br/><br/>  on ready {<br/><br/>    // we create a list (split) of the topics that can be removed (the one time only topic events), AND we go through each of them (foreach), seeing if they match up with the topic that was randomly selected and run (if), and if they do match up, then we remove the topic from the String List (list remove), as it has already been run, and we don't want it to be selected and run again&#58;<br/><br/>    // let's say that we want only &quot;dragon&quot; and &quot;princess&quot; to be one time only topic events, while &quot;sword&quot; is a repeatable topic event, for this example&#58;<br/><br/>    foreach (item_x, split (&quot;dragon;princess&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)) {<br/>      if (result_2 = item_x) {<br/>        list remove (global_data_object&#46;topic_string_list, result_2)<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</code></pre>",
