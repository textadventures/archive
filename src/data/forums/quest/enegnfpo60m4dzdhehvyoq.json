The listalias isn't displayed, and all it says is equipped. Then when I unequip it and try equipping it again, the name has disappeared completely, and it won't equip. The same thing happens when I try pasting from my Zombie 2 game. The weird thing is, this doesn't happen when I'm using my zombie 2 game.\r\nAny help is appreciated. I just want to equip and unequip items without my items disappearing.\r\n\r\nI'd also like help with these healing commands, as  I still can't get it to work. (Not when it's in an item object space, and not when I type it out)\r\nHeal Potion #object#\r\nif (player.potion > 0) {\r\n  if (player.hitpoints < player.max) {\r\n    player.hitpoints = player.hitpoints + 60\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nHeal Hyper Potion #object#\r\nif (player.hyper_potion > 0) {\r\n  if (player.hitpoints < player.max) {\r\n    player.hitpoints = player.max\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n",
