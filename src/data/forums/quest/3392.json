However, when i presented the game to other players, i received numerous reports of commands not working, such as being unable to go &quot;east&quot; when, not only the compass clearly showing that you could, but the command worked perfectly fine for myself. I was also told that the game hangs up often, especially when users go to different tabs during play. The failed commands appeared to be very irregular, I've double checked the usage of commands before I published the game.\n\nIs there anything I could have changed in setting up the game or are technical difficulties a common thing in general on this website?\nA copy of my game's files is attached",
