One way to find out is to run your game, click on Debugger, find the log book under the &quot;Objects&quot; tab, click on it and find the &quot;parent&quot; attribute to see what it is initially.<br/><br/>We really need to know the context (setup) within which this script is running.<br/><br/>Given your last statement, it seems that &quot;reception desk&quot; is the room the player is in (since you want to have exits from it). But I'm still not sure. (Once again, it would make it so easy to just see your game file!)",
