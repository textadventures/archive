'Attributes' Tab -&gt; Attributes (NOT Status Attributes) -&gt; Add -&gt; (see below, repeat as needed)\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: life\nAttribute Type: int (integer)\nAttribute Value: 999\n\n(Object Name: player)\nAttribute Name: damage\nAttribute Type: int (integer)\nAttribute Value: 100\n\n'room' Room Object -&gt;

conceptually: alive\nObject_name.dead = true ---&gt; conceptually: dead\n~OR~\nObject_name.alive = false ---&gt; conceptually: dead\nObject_name.alive = true ---&gt; conceptually: alive\n\nor, if you rather, don't use a Boolean Attribute (as it's limited to only two opposing Values: true~false), and instead use a String Attribute such as using 'condition' (or 'status_effects' ) as the String Attribute's Name, as it can have an unlimited number of single Values:\n\nObject_name.condition = &quot;normal&quot;\nObject_name.condition = &quot;dead&quot;\nObject_name.condition = &quot;unconscious&quot;\nObject_name.condition = &quot;poisoned&quot;\nObject_name.condition = &quot;asleep&quot;\nObject_name.condition = &quot;stunned&quot;\nObject_name.condition = &quot;paralyzed&quot;\nObject_name.condition = &quot;petrified&quot;\nObject_name.condition = &quot;silenced&quot;\n\n[code:hkxgbecf]if (player&#46;condition=&quot;dead&quot;) {\n  // having the 'player' be able to be 'dead' is for having a team~party (as the other characters can revive dead characters), as then we'd check if all of your characters are dead, and end game if so&#46;\n  // if you don't have a team~party, then (generally) there's really no reason for this, as you'd just check if life&lt;=0, ending the game if it is&#46;\n  msg (&quot;You died or were killed&#46;&quot;)\n  msg (&quot;GAME OVER&quot;)\n} else if (player&#46;condition=&quot;poisoned&quot;) {\n  player&#46;life = player&#46;life - 50\n  msg (&quot;The poison does 50 damage to your life&#46;&quot;)\n} else if (&#46;&#46;&#46;etc&#46;&#46;&#46;) { scripts }[/code:hkxgbecf]\n\nor... if you need~want an unlimited number of multiple values, then you need to use a List Attribute (adding and removing values from the list):\n\nplayer.condition=split (&quot;normal;alive&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)\n\n// you get poisoned:\n\nlist remove (player.condition, &quot;normal&quot;)\nlist add (player.condition, &quot;poisoned&quot;)\n// in code, it would now look like this: player.condition=split (&quot;alive;poisoned&quot;, &quot;;&quot;)\n\n// or, you get killed:\n\nlist remove (player.condition, &quot;alive&quot;)\nlist add (player.condition, &quot;dead&quot;)\n// in code, it would now look like this: player.condition=split (&quot;normal;dead&quot;, &quot;;&quot;)\n\n// or, you get poisoned and killed:\n\nlist remove (player.condition, &quot;normal&quot;)\nlist add (player.condition, &quot;poisoned&quot;)\nlist remove (player.condition, &quot;alive&quot;)\nlist add (player.condition, &quot;dead&quot;)\n// in code, it would now look like this: player.condition=split (&quot;poisoned;dead&quot;, &quot;;&quot;)\n\n[code:hkxgbecf]if (ListContains (player&#46;condition, &quot;poisoned&quot;) and ListContains (player&#46;condition, &quot;dead&quot;)) {\n  player&#46;life = player&#46;life - 50\n  msg (&quot;You are dead, yet the poison still remains as well&#46;&quot;)\n  msg (&quot;You need another character to revive you and cure you of your poison&#46;&quot;)\n}[/code:hkxgbecf]\n\n----\n\nissue 2:\n\n[quote=&quot;adammadam&quot;:hkxgbecf]so what is working is when I &quot;attack monster&quot;

But what isn't working is when I start a new game with the monsters health on 10, attack the monster, it says &quot;you attack monster&quot; but then it never dies, I can keep on attacking it, I'm guessing its health is never going down. [/quote:hkxgbecf]\n\nfor the part that is working, you got it set up correctly for your 'if (monster.health&gt;0)...' scripting:\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression\n\nObject_name = monster\nAttribute_name = health\nAttribute_name = dead\nAttribute_name = alive\n// though, you shouldn't have both 'dead' and 'alive' Boolean Attributes, as I've already said above.\n\nbut you are confused a bit with how to set up the 'attack' Command properly:\n\ndelete your 'attack' Command, as this is a bit more advanced, let's just stick with using the GUI~Editor's Verb usage for now, your 'attack' Verb.\n\nyou're still learning quest and~or coding... so you don't want to be trying to do~use too many things (especially the more advanced things) all at once.\n\n------\n\nissue 3,everything else looks fine (I think), so just MAKE SURE that your 'health' and 'damage' Attributes on your 'monster' Object and 'player' Player Object, are indeed (set to~as) the Attribute Type: int",

in game, it gives the message &quot;you attack monster&quot;. When I look at the monster in game it says &quot;it looks alive&quot;. When I set the monsters health to zero and play the game again, looking at the monster says &quot;it looks dead&quot;. Which is great those things are working. But what isn't working is when I start a new game with the monsters health on 10, attack the monster, it says &quot;you attack monster&quot; but then it never dies, I can keep on attacking it, I'm guessing its health is never going down. </blockquote><br/><br/>for the part that is working, you got it set up correctly for your 'if (monster.health&gt;0)...' scripting:<br/><br/>Object_name.Attribute_name = Value_or_Expression<br/><br/>Object_name = monster<br/>Attribute_name = health<br/>Attribute_name = dead<br/>Attribute_name = alive<br/>// though, you shouldn't have both 'dead' and 'alive' Boolean Attributes, as I've already said above.<br/><br/>but you are confused a bit with how to set up the 'attack' Command properly:<br/><br/>delete your 'attack' Command, as this is a bit more advanced, let's just stick with using the GUI~Editor's Verb usage for now, your 'attack' Verb.<br/><br/>you're still learning quest and~or coding... so you don't want to be trying to do~use too many things (especially the more advanced things) all at once.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>issue 3,everything else looks fine (I think), so just MAKE SURE that your 'health' and 'damage' Attributes on your 'monster' Object and 'player' Player Object, are indeed (set to~as) the Attribute Type: int",

' part):<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;object name=&quot;orc&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;orcy&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;ogre&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;alias&gt;ogry&lt;/alias&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>the person types in during game play:<br/><br/>fight orc<br/><br/>quest via my 'fight_command' Comamnd, will set up this Variable:<br/><br/>text = #text# = &quot;orc&quot;<br/>~OR~<br/>object = #object# = orc<br/><br/>and for multiple #text# and~or #object# :<br/><br/>text = #text# = &quot;orc&quot;<br/>text2 = #text2# = &quot;ogre&quot;<br/>text3 = #text3 = &quot;troll&quot;<br/>~ AND~OR ~<br/>object = #object# = &quot;orc&quot;<br/>object2 = #object2# = &quot;ogre&quot;<br/>object3 = #object3# = &quot;troll&quot;<br/><br/>[HK Edit: nevermind, I guess you can type in whatever you want between the #....#, my bad], so ignore this below:<br/>You have to use 'text' or 'object' between the ' #....# ', as this tells quest whether to look+get an Object or Text, so you can't do: #monster#<br/><br/>which will be used by the scripting (script -&gt; add new script) for example (using #object# ):<br/><br/>add new script -&gt; output -&gt; print a message -&gt; [expression] -&gt; &quot;The monster's name is &quot; + object.alias + &quot;.&quot;<br/>// outputs: The monster's name is orcy.<br/><br/>but, what if the person playing the game, types in: fight ogre ???<br/><br/>well, this is what Commands are for, general~dynamic usage !!!<br/><br/>quest via my 'fight_command' Comamnd, will set up this Variable:<br/><br/>text = #text# = &quot;ogre&quot;<br/>~OR~<br/>object = #object# = ogre<br/><br/>which will be used by the scripting (script -&gt; add new script) for example (using #object#):<br/><br/>add new script -&gt; output -&gt; print a message -&gt; [expression] -&gt; &quot;The monster's name is &quot; + object.alias + &quot;.&quot;<br/>// outputs: The monster's name is ogry.<br/><br/>the #text# vs #object# tells the quest engine~Command, what to look for and get:<br/><br/>an Object or just a mere text<br/><br/>I personally use #text# as using the #object# still confuses me (I still get errors~issues with it, due to still not understanding how to use it properly, lol), and if I need it to be an Object, I can just do this:<br/><br/>VARIABLE_name = GetObject (text)<br/><br/>wihtout any problems, unlike me trying to use #object#.<br/><br/>lastly, here's further what you can do with the Command's Pattern, some examples:<br/><br/>multiple #text# and~or #object#<br/>and for our own human use~grammer or whatever: add-in words that are part of the required Pattern's syntax<br/><br/>craft #object1# and #object2# and #object3#<br/>// the person would ahve to type in (for example): craft bread and jelly and peanut_butter<br/>// 'msg' scripting output: &quot;You made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! Wow, you're so awesome!&quot;)<br/><br/>craft #object1#, #object2#, and #object3#<br/>// the person would ahve to type in (for example): craft bread, jelly, and peanut_butter<br/>// 'msg' scripting output: &quot;You made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! Wow, you're so awesome!&quot;)<br/><br/>craft #object1# + #object2# + #object3#<br/>// the person would ahve to type in (for example): craft bread + jelly + peanut_butter<br/>// 'msg' scripting output: &quot;You made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
