In other words, when you create the coin, mark it as 'takeable' and 'unavailable' as opposed to 'invisible' because when an item is 'inaccessible' (unavailable), you shouldn't be able to see it anyway.  \nThen, when the heavy object is moved, then make the coin 'accessible' in the script.  You should end up seeing the coin in the room afterwards.  In fact, your code might be working, you just still have it marked as invisible so you wouldn't see that it's working.\n\nsteve 8)",
