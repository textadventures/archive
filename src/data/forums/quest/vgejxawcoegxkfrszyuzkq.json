Any way what I want to do is have a character do an action or something like that then run a script it a list of responses to give one of, but the character can do that action multiple times each time having one of a the responses selected from the list. \r\nSo as an related example a guy I know has in his game a scene where the player is knocking on a person's door, and the person in question refuses to answer, so the player has to be persistent and harass them till they answer. Now from what I understand he has it so there are a list of responses to knocking he has scripted and when the player knocks it choose from any of the responses to reply, and after a number of turns the person is scripted to finally answer the door. I like this however since the script choose from any of the listed answers you can get the same one multiple times in a row, and I don't like that.\r\n\r\nSo what I want to do is similar with you getting responses from the scripted list each turn for lets say ten turns then the character is forced to answer the door. However to prevent the player from getting the same response more then once I want to change the scripts each turn the player knocks the script chooses one response for that turn then removes it from the list so next time it has to choose another so by turn nine there is only one possible response. I do know how to script it so a player gets a different response specifically for that turn, like this one for turn one, this one for turn two, but I rather it be choose at ramrod so the order of the responses changes each play through.\r\n\r\nAny ideas oh how to do that?\r\n",
