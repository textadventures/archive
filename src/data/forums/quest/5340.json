Basically, the player is supposed to hit a monster before it kills them. I have a simple timer system set up to do this, as well as a one-hit system for killing the monster. I would like to give different monsters different amounts of health, instead of them all being easy to kill. If possible, I would also like to be able to make different objects take more or less health.\n\nPlease explain how to do this without going into Code View, as I said I am just starting and I don't understand code yet.",

I guess if you really want to, I suppose you could do~use the 'firsttime~otherwise' Script, so that you only get that message the first time you click on 'fight' of the dead orc, or your other option is to just not have any message at all (but that will confuse the person playing the game, as they click on 'fight' of the dead orc, but nothing happens... you need to tell them why, as it may not be intuitive for them... orc is dead... you can't fight it anymore, lol).",
