This would be fine, but it requires the player to type \"unlock crate\" once they have the crowbar, which certainly isn't how I'd phrase it, and it classifies \"unlocking\" and \"opening\" the crate to be 2 separate actions, which seems unintuitive. I'd rather the player say \"use crowbar on crate\" or even just \"open crate\" while carrying the crowbar. How can I do this?",
