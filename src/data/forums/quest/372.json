      "EditableText": "Hey, folks.  Just trying out Quest.  I like it a lot.\n\nFor some reason, I cannot get the Hide command to work correctly for me. Or, perhaps it's working correctly, and I'm just assuming it is supposed to function differently.\n\nI have a start room, and an apple object. I created a food object type, with Edible and Nourishment properties. I also assigned an 'eat' action to the food object type. Then I gave the apple object the food object type. The 'eat' action of the food object type calls an ActionEat procedure. I also created a custom player command called 'eat'. When the player types 'eat &lt;object&gt;', the command calls the eat action of #quest.lastobject#, assuming an eat action exists for #quest.lastobject#. (This is checked via a conditional.) The eat action in turn calls the ActionEat procedure.\n\nThe ActionEat procedure uses #quest.lastobject# as well. It checks to see if the player is in possession of #quest.lastobject#. If not, it informs the player that they do not have that item to eat. If the player does possess the item, it checks to see if the item has the Edible property. If the item does not have this property, it informs the player that the item is not edible. If the item does have the Edible property, the player is informed that they have eaten the item. I then attempt to destroy the item by using the Hide Command. This is where I get confused.\n\nThe apple does not disappear. I can eat it multiple times. If I drop it after I eat it, it disappears, but I can still interact with it: pick it up, eat it, drop it again, ad infinitum. Anyone have any advice?\n\n----------------\n\nI was also wondering if it is possible to assess a group of objects, such as all of the objects within a room. Is it possible to cycle through only specific types? For instance, is there a way to create a GetFirstObjectInRoom function, and a GetNextObjectInRoom function, and a GetNumOfObjectsInRoom function? Could these be given parameters of object types, such as 'people', 'food', 'clothing', etc? I think these are called Collections, but I am a little rusty on my programming.\n\nThanks in advance for any replies.",

I was developing exclusively in QDK, and so did not see the discrepancy. Using the [i:214mg772]Hide an object[/i:214mg772] command in QDK generates an ASL [b:214mg772]Conceal[/b:214mg772] statement.
