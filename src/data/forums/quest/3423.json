Unfortunately, as waiting is part of the challenge, the nifty little snap feature hinders you here: once the text reaches the bottom of the screen it keeps going, but you're still looking at exactly what fits on your screen with your last command at the top.\n\ntl;dr I would like to know if there's a way to turn off the window snapping that keeps you from following the text to its end; preferably in-game so that it could be turned back on, but I'll find work arounds if not.\n\nThanks, everybody!",

      "EditableText": "Actually Pertex it sounds to me like a different issue - it's not related to the problems running frequent timers when playing via the web.\n\nI think one problem here is that the text will scroll to the top of the last command, even if the user has already below that. So that's a bug that should be looked at. The other thing is that it would probably be a good idea to have a script command to force the text to scroll to the end - that way you could keep adding countdown text without the user having to scroll manually.\n\nI'll add these to the issue tracker.\n\nI think it should be quite simple to work around the issue, by manually calling the JavaScript function &quot;markScrollPosition&quot; when writing the countdown text.",
