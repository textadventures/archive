This forces the player to have to scroll back to read the story. Do I have something set wrong? It does not make sense that it does this, a normal computer page starts at the top so that the player scrolls down as they read the text.",

All of my additional story text which exist in the description block for &quot;Game&quot; and text blocks for each of the two rooms to date is posted as it should be but the screen is still automatically scrolling to the bottom of the text which requires the player to have to scroll back up to read it from the beginning. Is there a way I can make the screens display all new text that is called up from the top of the source instead of from the bottom? Like when you pull up a word doc or any text page on the web it automatically starts at the top of the page, it does not go to the bottom of the document and start there.",
