      "EditableText": "Hello all im make a Island Survival game where you can take resources and craft them into different things. Well I also want to add traps to lay to catch game. Now I already am using a AI turn script that moves to a different room at random every turn; So question is there a way to drop the trap in a room setting it making the trap active. Then when the deer enters that room theres a possibility chance of ending the AI turn script? I have made several attempts and can't figure it out, I even changed player into object drop trap trying to get some function there but nothing. I know the best way just can't word it, so a script that &quot;When Object.deer is in room Object.drop trap GetRandomInt 1-25% Then Disable AI turn script&quot; is there a way to word this for quest please help thank you.\n\nMike",

There was I could not really figure out how to make it for when the object &quot;deer&quot; enters the room with object &quot;trap&quot; that was the part I really got stuck on.
