The UI would need reimplementing though - Mono's take on WinForms appears to be a big bag of fail. But for the Player at least, the UI can be ridiculously simple, as it can be just an output textbox and an input textbox.\n\nIdeally we'd have HTML output, and the inventory, places/objects and compass panes would be nice for consistency with the Windows version, but even an initial version without them would be better than nothing.\n\nI hacked together a quick prototype using Gtk# with MonoDevelop on the Mac, and I got some game output to appear, which was nice. You need to use the latest MonoDevelop beta, as it's the only one that supports .net 4.0 at the moment. My app crashed when I resized the window though, hmmmm.\n\nI'll probably check in a console app soon, which will be an example of the simplest possible Player. Then that can be used as the basis for a Gtk# app (or even better, MonoMac, though it's not clear what the status of that is right now).\n\nI should probably save any significant effort on this until after the 5.0 release (should be by the end of August), but it's either this or fixing bugs or writing documentation right now - so this is what it looks like when I'm procrastinating!",
