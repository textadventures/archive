We're trying, however, to make it so that, when a player achieves a certain score, the game ends. We would like to do this through the Windows interface, rather than by digging into the code directly. We expected that we could reference it the same way that we do health, using an &quot;if&quot; statement and &quot;object attribute equals.&quot; No dice so far. Can anyone help?\n\nThanks,\nSteve",
