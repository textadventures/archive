I renamed it &quot;healthTimer&quot;.\n3) Your &quot;you lost&quot; message was outside the &quot;if&quot;. It's now inside.\n4) DecreaseHealth decreases the player health by the amount you give it. Since you passed -1, it decreased it by -1... which actually increased it by 1. I changed it to DecreaseHealth(1) to have it decrease by 1 each time.\n\nYou have it set up as a timer, with a period of 2 seconds. If you want the health to decrease on each turn, then you should set up a turn script instead.",
