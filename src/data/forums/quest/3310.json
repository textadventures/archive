      "EditableText": "Hi tdhddewar92 welcome to Quest, Ive looked at your game and I noticed that you have an empty command line so I've filled it in and sent it back to you. It is a simple form of what you want. I've used this a lot in my game and to my way of thinking it makes quest look kind of like an A. I. as long as you can think of what people might type in. The semi colons separate two commands, but if you can think of other commands to listen, like (hark or listen to that) then it makes the game( in my eyes ) easier to communicate with. Sorry about the waffling. But having said all that someone else may explain a another way.  Also you can go into the library files and change the standard replies. All the best Terry <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
