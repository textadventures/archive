Strings (aka, text: a single collection of characters/symbols, but not all of them)\r\n2. Integers (Non-Decimal Numbers), Doubles (Floats/Floating Points/Decimal Numbers)\r\n3. Booleans (true/false)\r\n4. Objects (names of Objects which are references/pointers to the actual Object)\r\n5. Scripts (actions/events of individual Objects: 'method' Attributes)\r\n6. Lists\r\n7. Dictionaries\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nanything (including numbers: numerical characters/symbols) in double quotes, is a String Value\r\n\r\nanything not in double quotes, and is not a number, and is not a reserved/special value (such as 'true', 'false, 'this', and etc VARIABLE'S names), is an Object (reference/pointer) Value\r\n\r\nsome examples (using direct code scripting):\r\n\r\nNAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION\r\n\r\n(in the GUI/Editor: run as script -> add new script -> 'variables' section/category -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> set variable NAME_OF_OBJECT.NAME_OF_ATTRIBUTE = [EXPRESSION] VALUE_OR_EXPRESSION)\r\n\r\n(quest uses the Value in scripting, to determine/parse what Data Type the Attribute is. Whereas, I'm just using the Attribute's name to show you how the Data Types differ and work: the Attribute's name has NOTHING to do with what Data Type it is)\r\n\r\n(however, if using the GUI/Editor and/or directly in the xml/aslx tag block coding, you're setting the Attribute's Data Type, and so when you give it a Value or when you change it's Value in scripting, those Values' Data Types must match up with the Attributes' Data Types)\r\n\r\n(I'm just using the 'player' Player Object for my Object, for this example, but it can be any Object: 'game', 'room', or your own/custom Objects, such as: 'orc', 'dragon', 'katana', 'room_99', etc etc etc)\r\n\r\n(also, you'd give the Attribute an actual name, but I'm using it to just show how the Data Types differs and work)\r\n\r\nplayer.string_attribute = \"HK\"\r\nplayer.string_attribute = \"34\"\r\nplayer.integer_attribute = 34\r\nplayer.object_attribute = HK // also, there of course actually has to be an existing 'HK' Object, else you get an error\r\nplayer.boolean_attribute = true\r\nplayer.boolean_attribute = false\r\nplayer.string_attribute = \"true\"\r\nplayer.string_attribute = \"false\"\r\nplayer.double_attribute = 4.3\r\nplayer.string_attribute = \"4.3\"\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nmis-matched Data Types causes errors... so you got to be very careful\r\n\r\nfor example with doing addition arithmetic operation (again in direct code scripting):\r\n\r\n// -----------------------\r\n\r\n// NO error:\r\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = 0\r\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = player.strength_integer_attribute + 5\r\n// player.strength_integer-attribute = (old: 0) + 5 = 5\r\n\r\n// --------------------\r\n\r\n// ERROR:\r\n\r\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = 0\r\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = player.strength_integer_attribute + \"5\"\r\n// ERROR: can't arithemtic addition compute 'INTEGER' + \"STRING' = HUH? computers (and humans too) have no idea what this would be, as it defies logic of math addition: 23 + hi = ILLOGICAL\r\n\r\n// ----------------\r\n\r\n// ERROR:\r\n\r\nplayer.strength_string_attribute = \"0\"\r\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = player.strength_string_attribute + 5\r\n// ERROR: can't compute arithmetic addition of: 'STRING' + 'INTEGER'\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n// NO error:\r\n\r\nin programming, since it also involves Strings, there's concatenation (literally putting things together), which often uses the same '+' operation symbol as arithmetic addition:\r\n\r\nplayer.strength_string_attribute = \"0\"\r\nplayer.strength_string_attribute = player.strength_string_attribute + \"5\"\r\n// player.strength_string_attribute = \"05\"\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\narithmetic addition vs concatention:\r\n\r\n5 + 5 = 10\r\n55 + 55 = 110\r\n\r\n\"5\" + \"5\" = \"55\"\r\n\"55\" + \"55\" = \"5555\"\r\n\r\n\"mama\" + \"mia\" = \"mamamia\"\r\n\"mia\" + \"mama\" = \"miamama\"\r\n\r\n\"mama\" + \"9\" = \"mama9\"\r\n\r\n\"mama\" + 9 = ERROR\r\n9 + \"mama\" = ERROR\r\n\r\n\"mama\" + \" \" + \"mia\" = \"mama mia\"\r\n\"mama \" + \"mia\" = \"mama mia\"\r\n\"mama\" + \" mia\" = \"mama mia\"\r\n\"mama\" + \" \" + \"9\" + \" \" + \"mia\" + \" \" + \"9\" = \"mama 9 mia 9\"\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nyou can see greater detail (though some of it is wrong, as this was back when I still didn't full understand some of the programming concepts such as the logic operators vs bit-logic operators) about Attributes and the 'if' Script usage here:\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk\r\n\r\nask if you got any questions",

Whereas, I'm just using the Attribute's name to show you how the Data Types differ and work: the Attribute's name has NOTHING to do with what Data Type it is)</p>\n<p>(however, if using the GUI/Editor and/or directly in the xml/aslx tag block coding, you're setting the Attribute's Data Type, and so when you give it a Value or when you change it's Value in scripting, those Values' Data Types must match up with the Attributes' Data Types)</p>\n<p>(I'm just using the 'player' Player Object for my Object, for this example, but it can be any Object: 'game', 'room', or your own/custom Objects, such as: 'orc', 'dragon', 'katana', 'room_99', etc etc etc)</p>\n<p>(also, you'd give the Attribute an actual name, but I'm using it to just show how the Data Types differs and work)</p>\n<p>player.string_attribute = \"HK\"<br>\nplayer.string_attribute = \"34\"<br>\nplayer.integer_attribute = 34<br>\nplayer.object_attribute = HK // also, there of course actually has to be an existing 'HK' Object, else you get an error<br>\nplayer.boolean_attribute = true<br>\nplayer.boolean_attribute = false<br>\nplayer.string_attribute = \"true\"<br>\nplayer.string_attribute = \"false\"<br>\nplayer.double_attribute = 4.3<br>\nplayer.string_attribute = \"4.3\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>mis-matched Data Types causes errors... so you got to be very careful</p>\n<p>for example with doing addition arithmetic operation (again in direct code scripting):</p>\n<p>// -----------------------</p>\n<p>// NO error:<br>\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = 0<br>\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = player.strength_integer_attribute + 5<br>\n// player.strength_integer-attribute = (old: 0) + 5 = 5</p>\n<p>// --------------------</p>\n<p>// ERROR:</p>\n<p>player.strength_integer_attribute = 0<br>\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = player.strength_integer_attribute + \"5\"<br>\n// ERROR: can't arithemtic addition compute 'INTEGER' + \"STRING' = HUH? computers (and humans too) have no idea what this would be, as it defies logic of math addition: 23 + hi = ILLOGICAL</p>\n<p>// ----------------</p>\n<p>// ERROR:</p>\n<p>player.strength_string_attribute = \"0\"<br>\nplayer.strength_integer_attribute = player.strength_string_attribute + 5<br>\n// ERROR: can't compute arithmetic addition of: 'STRING' + 'INTEGER'</p>\n<hr>\n<p>// NO error:</p>\n<p>in programming, since it also involves Strings, there's concatenation (literally putting things together), which often uses the same '+' operation symbol as arithmetic addition:</p>\n<p>player.strength_string_attribute = \"0\"<br>\nplayer.strength_string_attribute = player.strength_string_attribute + \"5\"<br>\n// player.strength_string_attribute = \"05\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>arithmetic addition vs concatention:</p>\n<p>5 + 5 = 10<br>\n55 + 55 = 110</p>\n<p>\"5\" + \"5\" = \"55\"<br>\n\"55\" + \"55\" = \"5555\"</p>\n<p>\"mama\" + \"mia\" = \"mamamia\"<br>\n\"mia\" + \"mama\" = \"miamama\"</p>\n<p>\"mama\" + \"9\" = \"mama9\"</p>\n<p>\"mama\" + 9 = ERROR<br>\n9 + \"mama\" = ERROR</p>\n<p>\"mama\" + \" \" + \"mia\" = \"mama mia\"<br>\n\"mama \" + \"mia\" = \"mama mia\"<br>\n\"mama\" + \" mia\" = \"mama mia\"<br>\n\"mama\" + \" \" + \"9\" + \" \" + \"mia\" + \" \" + \"9\" = \"mama 9 mia 9\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>you can see greater detail (though some of it is wrong, as this was back when I still didn't full understand some of the programming concepts such as the logic operators vs bit-logic operators) about Attributes and the 'if' Script usage here:</p>\n<p>http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/5559/attributes-and-if-script-guide-by-hk</p>\n<p>ask if you got any questions</p>\n\n",
