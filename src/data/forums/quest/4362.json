However I want these 3 drawers to become visible when you search or look at it, is this possible? I cannot figure out how to do this. Inside of Drawer 2 there is a Convex Lens and a photo which you can pick up the convex lens, but it is not highlighted in blue or underlined. How would I fix this? Also I wanted to use this convex lens to search a painting and reveal a code for a keypad(which I've worked out how to put the code into the script, but I don't know how to use it in game). Lastly how do you create a 1 minute countdown time for a specific room, if thats possible? This is for a school project, which I am not enjoying working this program out by myself. Any help would be appreciated. \n\nIve just included the file, I thought that might be easiest. Since Im having such problems",
