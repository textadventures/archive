Once you've done that an option will appear called &quot;after switching on the object.&quot; Click 'add a script' and down near the bottom of the pop up menu there will be an option for &quot;make room light.&quot; Select that and choose the basement for the room. \n- Finally down the bottom of the same tab is a box labelled &quot;object is a light source.&quot; Select that and choose &quot;weak&quot; from the drop down menu. Weak light sources can be used even when the room is dark but they do not illuminate the room.\n\n\n[i:zd0we5w5]c)  Once the searching is complete, and upon wanting to leaving the basement, I would have to[b:zd0we5w5]TURN OFF[/b:zd0we5w5] the light [u:zd0we5w5]before[/u:zd0we5w5] being able to go back [b:zd0we5w5]UP[/b:zd0we5w5] to the hallway.[/i:zd0we5w5]\n\nFor this one you need to do a few things. \n- First you need to make sure that the exit from the basement to the hall has a name. (Select the exit and add whatever you want to call it to the name field.) \n- While you're here, you should add a message to the field marked &quot;Print message when locked,&quot; something along the lines of &quot;didn't your father ever teach you not to waste electricity?&quot; so that the player knows they are blocked by the fact they've left the light on.\n- Then go to the options tab for the exit, select &quot;object is a light source&quot; and set it to weak.\n- Then go back to your light switch object and add another script to the &quot;after switching on the light switch&quot; and choose lock exit, and select the exit you just named.\n- Finally, to unlock the exit again once the light is turned off, there is a similar section under the one you've been using called &quot;after switching off the object.&quot; You need to add two scripts here, &quot;make room dark&quot; and &quot;unlock exit.&quot;\n\nHope this helps <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

Once you've done that an option will appear called &quot;after switching on the object.&quot; Click 'add a script' and down near the bottom of the pop up menu there will be an option for &quot;make room light.&quot; Select that and choose the basement for the room. <br/>- Finally down the bottom of the same tab is a box labelled &quot;object is a light source.&quot; Select that and choose &quot;weak&quot; from the drop down menu. Weak light sources can be used even when the room is dark but they do not illuminate the room.<br/><br/><br/><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">c)  Once the searching is complete, and upon wanting to leaving the basement, I would have to<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">TURN OFF</span> the light <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">before</span> being able to go back <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">UP</span> to the hallway.</span><br/><br/>For this one you need to do a few things. <br/>- First you need to make sure that the exit from the basement to the hall has a name. (Select the exit and add whatever you want to call it to the name field.) <br/>- While you're here, you should add a message to the field marked &quot;Print message when locked,&quot; something along the lines of &quot;didn't your father ever teach you not to waste electricity?&quot; so that the player knows they are blocked by the fact they've left the light on.<br/>- Then go to the options tab for the exit, select &quot;object is a light source&quot; and set it to weak.<br/>- Then go back to your light switch object and add another script to the &quot;after switching on the light switch&quot; and choose lock exit, and select the exit you just named.<br/>- Finally, to unlock the exit again once the light is turned off, there is a similar section under the one you've been using called &quot;after switching off the object.&quot; You need to add two scripts here, &quot;make room dark&quot; and &quot;unlock exit.&quot;<br/><br/>Hope this helps <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
