It is very difficult for me to understand your explanations in this forum due to the language and my inexperience.  I want the player to be able to change the font size during gameplay.  The player would have to enter a command followed by a number which would be the font size.  The command does not exist in Spanish and I would have to do it from scratch.  Could you help me?  Thank you very much!!!  I need the explanation to be easy to understand...\r\nI know how create a command to change the font size, but not to a size input by the player.",
