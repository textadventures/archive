Shucks...</p>\n<p>I knew nothing about programming in 2017.  The people on this forum taught me everything I know.  So, I try to help out (when I'm not busy writing my own game).</p>\n<p>In fact, just so you know, I can make my own websites now, just by learning to do things in Quest.  So, stick with it, and you'll be helping new people on here before you know it!</p>\n\n",
