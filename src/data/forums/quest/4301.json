Just like a personality quiz. What I had in mind was to add an object to the inventory whenever they answered and in the end count those objects to see which objects has been added the most. Sadly I am not sure how to do this.\n\nAny kind help would be appreciated a lot! Using dictionaries and lists is always an option as well If I can understand how to manipulate the data and reach to the variables.\n\nThank you,\nhuma",
