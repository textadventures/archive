Me and my brother have both been playing HavenHold today (only works with LAN IP's though, as there's a router firewall). I'm having a really weird problem. Basically I have most stuff in libraries (practically all except the define game block). Now one library does all the commands, it says in the logs it was loaded fine but when I try to do any commands, it doesn't work... Other libraries are working fine, as the maps have loaded and all the character creation stuff works fine... No idea what the problem is, anybody got any ideas?\r\n\r\n((WOOT HavenHold!!!))",
