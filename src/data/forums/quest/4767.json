There *must* be an object specified in what's typed (so something like &quot;dress&quot; could not be a verb, as there is no object). The action performed by the verb is specified by the object in question. So if you have &quot;kick #object#&quot; as the pattern for your verb, then if you type &quot;kick ball&quot;, it will invoke the &quot;kick&quot; attribute on the ball object, if it has one. (You can specify the default behavior for objects that don't.) You get to specify the name of the attribute to use for the verb, if you're creating your own.\n\nCommands, on the other hand, might take an object or not in the pattern, but the script for a command is not routed to the object. There is just the one script in the command itself. This allow you to have handling for a specific input in one place, regardless of any objects specified (if one is relevant). So, if you wanted to write a single bit of script to handle the same action for *all* objects, or if you have an input phrase that has no objects, you'd use a command. \n\nAn example of this would be if, for example, you had a general purpose combat system and a general &quot;attack (monster)&quot; command, that launches the command code with the object in question. You don't want the monster itself to handle the general &quot;attack&quot; command. (It probably will handle individual blows during combat, though.) So a command would work well for that. It will automatically work for all relevant objects without having to add script to each object.\n\nOther examples of commands include things with no objects, like &quot;help&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, &quot;die&quot;, &quot;sleep&quot;, etc.\n\nThe easiest way to add a verb to an object is on the object's &quot;Verbs&quot; tab. You can add handling for either an existing verb or for a new one (by typing it in). It also adds the verb into the object's verbs list when you click on it.\n\nA final thought (for now) about commands is that commands can be specific to a room.
