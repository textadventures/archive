I still have trouble getting it right too, sighs\n\n------\n\nokay, the first part: Adding A Simple Command\n\nthis involves creating a &quot;say&quot; command.\n\nif you make the command correctly, when you (as a game player) type in: say ???, the say triggers the command, and what it does is to return what you type in after ' say '.\n\nso,\n\nif you type in say hi, it will output back: hi\nif you type in say what is your name, it will output back: what is your name\nif you type in say say, have you seen my jacket?, it will output back: say, have you seen my jacket?\n\nas it's example shows:\n\n[quote=&quot;wiki&quot;:32ck0e91]For example: \n\nIf the player types &quot;say hello&quot;, the &quot;text&quot; string variable will contain &quot;hello&quot; \nIf the player types &quot;say what a lovely day&quot;, the &quot;text&quot; string variable will contain &quot;what a lovely day&quot;[/quote:32ck0e91]\n\n----\n\nfor the next part, since the above isn't really useful (lol), we're going to show some basic ways of making it more useful.\n\nnow for your &quot;say&quot; command, you want to: Add A Script (see the picture on the wiki) -&gt;\n\nPrint A Message -&gt; Print [expression] (make sure you change this to *EXPRESSION*, as using the MESSAGE choice will prevent this from working, this might be your problem that you're having) &quot;You say &quot; + text + &quot;, but nobody replies.&quot;\n\nah, the tutorial has this instead (I think this syntax will still work fine too, but let me test it, brb in a minute after posting this post, lol):\n\n&quot;You say &quot;&quot; + text + &quot;&quot;, but nobody replies.&quot;\n\nthe rules of getting the syntax correct are way too confusing~complex for me to try to explain, so I'm not going to do so, lol.\n\nwell, I'll give it a partial go at it:\n\nif you're just typing in a message you wanna say, then you just select the [MESSAGE] choice, and then just type in your message.\n\nthe problem lies when you want to have your message along with game coding. As first, you got to remember to switch it to [EXPRESSION], but here's where it gets complex~confusing:\n\nprose = your message\ncode = game code\n\nyou need to separate the prose and code, and code and code too, with + signs, so it would look like this (for an example):\n\nPrint [EXPRESSION] &quot;Prose1 + code1 + prose2 + code2&quot;\n\nbut, you also got to get the &quot; marks correct too... this is the confusing part...\n\nPrint [EXPRESSION] &quot;Prose1 &quot; + code1 + &quot; prose1 &quot; + code2 + &quot;.&quot;\n\nthis is my method for getting it correct:\n\n&quot; + code + &quot; and then you need quotes for the beginning and the end of the entire line.\n\nso, it breaks down into parts (represented by the brackets) like this:\n\n[ &quot; ] [ prose1 ] [ &quot; + code1 + &quot; ] [ prose2 ] [ &quot; + code2 + &quot; ] [ .&quot; ]\n\nso, here is what it would look like (using my version of~from the tutorial's example):\n\nprose1 = You say\ncode1 = text\nprose2 = , but nobody replies\n\n[ &quot; ] [ prose1 ] [ &quot; + code1 + &quot; ] [ prose2 ] [ .&quot; ]\n[ &quot; ] [ You say ] [ &quot; + text + &quot; ] [ , but nobody replies ] [ .&quot; ]\n&quot;You say &quot; + text + &quot;, but nobody replies.&quot;\n\nyou (as a game player) type in:\n\nsay I have fallen and I cannot get up!\n\nthe game outputs: \n\nYou say I have fallen and cannot get up!, but nobody replies.\n\n---------\n\nthe part about the use of the [ \\&quot; ] or [ ' ] is for putting in either a &quot; or a ' as a part of your message.\n\ndue to the coding, for the &quot; mark, you need to the \\ sign with it, to tell the game coding that this is not a coding sign, it is just a quatation mark, as otherwise, the &quot; mark is a code, telling the game to do some coding thing.\n\nor, if you'd rather, you can just use the single quatation mark ( ' ), as this isn't a code of the game, so it works fine as is.\n\nfor example:\n\n[ &quot; ] [ prose1 ] [ \\&quot; ] [ &quot; + code1 + &quot; ] [ \\&quot; ] [ prose2 ] [ .&quot; ]\n[ &quot; ] [ You say, ] [ \\&quot; ] [ &quot; + text + &quot; ] [ \\&quot; ] [ , but nobody replies ] [ .&quot; ]\n&quot;You say, /&quot; &quot; + text + &quot; \\&quot;, but nobody replies.&quot;\n\nyou (as a game player) type in:\n\nsay I have fallen and I cannot get up!\n\nthe game outputs: \n\nYou say, &quot; I have fallen and cannot get up! &quot;, but nobody replies.\n\n~OR~\n\n[ &quot; ] [ prose1 ] [ ' ] [ &quot; + code1 + &quot; ] [ ' ] [ prose2 ] [ .&quot; ]\n[ &quot; ] [ You say, ] [ ' ] [ &quot; + text + &quot; ] [ ' ] [ , but nobody replies ] [ .&quot; ]\n&quot;You say, ' &quot; + text + &quot; ', but nobody replies.&quot;\n\nyou (as a game player) type in:\n\nsay I have fallen and I cannot get up!\n\nthe game outputs: \n\nYou say, ' I have fallen and cannot get up! ', but nobody replies.\n\n---------\n\nnext part of wiki: Alternative Command Patterns\n\nin your command setting window, you can add more code words in by using a semicolon:\n\nsay #text#;shout #text#;yell #text#\n\nso, you can use any of these words:\n\nsay #text#\ngame player types in: say hi\ngame outputs: hi\n\nshout #text#\ngame player types in: shout hi\ngame outputs: hi\n\nyell #text#\ngame player types in: yell hi\ngame outputs: hi\n\nthis is useful for helping the player out, as he may think of typing in talk, whereas if you only use &quot;say&quot;, then he's stuck, as he doesn't realize to try using the word &quot;say&quot;. This way, you give more code words for him to be able to hopefully guess at, using one of them, lol. this same thing applies for verbs, the person may not think of using the word &quot;equip&quot;, so add in other words for the same verb code too, such as &quot;put on&quot; and~or &quot;wear&quot; and~or &quot;clothe&quot;.\n\n--------\n\nlet me know if you need help with the weighing section or the talk to troll section.",
