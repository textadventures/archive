The plan is to have it open up into a title screen with various buttons, or maybe hyperlinks if need be. I've figured out how to use the start scripts to put up a print message with the title screen information, and to have it wait for input, but I'm not sure how to add in the buttons. Any ideas or is this going too far beyond what the engine is meant for?",
