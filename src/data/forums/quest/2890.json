I would of thought there would of been some demo and maybe a couple of short games as samples in the main directory.\n\nI'm used to another IF engine and Quest seems to have less built in functions, eg. sitting in a chair. If am sitting in a chair it still lists the chair as if its empty (no description telling me i am sitting on object if that is the case) and i can keep using sit on chair without the game telling me im already in it. It seems i have to set that up myself.  \n\nI would of thought all the basic things you do in an adventure game would have default scripts already set for it.\n\nI tried creating a flag and using IF for description of the chair, but that didn't work, i must of did something wrong there.\n\nI tried also creating an attribute Occupied and set to false. I dont know how to change that when a player sits in a seat to true and using that (which the attribute is a flag right? if its a boolean) for the IF/description in setup.\n\nOf course Quest has alot of flexibility, depth and customization. It just seems to have a steep learning curve.\n\nI think i would pick this up faster if there was a few short games i could look under the hood so to speak and see how it works.",

If a character lays down on a bed or sits on a chair, i would say the player/character would automatically be moved to that object and in the room description be said to be laying/sitting on the object.\n\nAnd its an interesting question about can the player reach other objects from where they are sitting/laying on.    What if the bed or chair as an object could be inner room boundary?  Say you are in a motel room. And there is a chest of draws on either side of the bed with objects on it eg. Lamp and your beer.  When the player is sitting or laying on the bed, the objects listed first will be what is part of the inner room boundary (for lack of better wording..sectioned parts of a room?) and then the rest of the room that has objects to be listed will be given.\n\nThe player can take or put things on the bed or inside the draws or ontop of.   But cannot reach for the remote that might be sitting ontop of the television on the opposite side of the room.. unless either maybe the player types &quot;get up and take tv remote.&quot; or alternatively  &quot;take tv remote&quot; has the narrative say &quot;You get out/off the bed and retrieve the tv remote sitting on the television.&quot; The player is moved out/off bed.\n\nIf the player is in bed then the word &quot;Out&quot; will be used instead of, &quot;off&quot;. And the tv remote to be automatically described where it is currently sitting or positioned before being picked up. \n\nWithout getting off tangent, having inner boundaries of a room i have thought about in the past.  Having something like this added to the library of Quest would be good.   Handy for like the player enters a bar-room, where there are several pool tables, and tables where there are card games going on and the main bar itself. Each of these inner locations/sub-locations within the room, can have its only description of which characters are there when you go to that area.   It's like when watching a movie, the camera is upclose or zoomed in a specific part of a room where you the viewer can only see the immediate surroundings, while everything is background.   \n\nThis would require two &quot;look&quot; commands i guess, one for immediate surroundings if in a sub-location &quot;look around you&quot; and the standard &quot;look&quot; one for an overview for the whole room, listing a general setting of the room. \n\nThis could allow also characters within the room to move to different sub-locations. I don't know if Quest has a walk function for movement of characters?  allowing for dynamic game play.  Eg. a trigger by time or event causes x number of characters to leave the bar or some characters has had enough playing cards and moves to the bar.  \n\nWhile using this example of a bar-room and sub-locations, what about the player talking to a group of people.  The player might be a detective making inquires. Asking small groups of people basic questions would logically as in RL save a lot of time. The characters who do know something may step forward and a more one on one conversation takes place, or have some groups scripted to ignore the player. \nMaybe asking questions around the different sub-locations has another character scripted to approach the player or maybe a group approaches the player to throw him out. \n\nAnyway getting back to my previous post.  Is there any sample short games available for people learning to use Quest can benefit from by looking at how it was made in the editor? Like a one or two room game or something, yet has alot of stuff the player can do or interact with?\nIf there isnt, then a suggestion to have something made for beginners and advanced users and to be included in a samples folder than gets add with the installer.",
