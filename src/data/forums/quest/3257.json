However, I seem to be having an issue making the game available through the website and Quest downloader. I first uploaded the file two days ago. I knew it could potentially take some time to appear, since I saw the message about only .quest games created through the Quest program being accepted.\n\nI was just wondering if there's an issue, or if I just need to sit back and wait a little longer. It's only a gamebook, but I'm interested to see something I've done put out there for others to view and play. Thanks for your help, everyone!",

I was seeing all the same stuff you were, evidently, but of course I just assumed that I would be able to view it on that page because I was logged in. I never considered that others would be able to view it also. Oh well, if it's there, that's the main thing. Hopefully sometime later it'll be posted on the newest games list.\n\nHats off to you, sir!",
