Your able to break items down take them and combine them to create new items like tools and weapons but just basics for now. Any way I have it where items stack by volume which when you make more the volume of the item increases, well I wanted to display the volume amount of a item like the planks and tree trunks when you look at it. I have tried a Expression ( &quot;You have &quot; + planks.volume.value + &quot;planks.&quot; ) but it doesn't work. How am I actually suppose to word it please help. Also if you play it hit the bush first because if you hit grass first it bugs out and won't let you hit bush after that I have no clue why cause hitting bush first then grass works but not visa versa.",
