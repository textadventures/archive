      "EditableText": "I like to use the web version of Quest on my cell phone when I'm traveling.   My cell phone has a 4 1/2 inch screen so the text and buttons appear as almost microscopic on it.  This requires me to zoom in to be able to read stuff and to click buttons.  This is causing a problem.  If I click, \"Add a new script\", for instance, the window for selecting what type of script you want to select pops up.  And it locks my ability to zoom.  I will only see a couple of options to select, and can't scroll around to select any more.  And worse, the \"Okay\" button that you have to push to close that window is off the screen.  And because it locks the zoom, I can't zoom back out, or move the screen in order to get that button back on the screen.  This also happens with the script window.  The entire screen is just... locked in place and at that zoom level.   There's no way around this.  I have to zoom in to click the \"Add a script\" button, but then the screen is locked when the script type selection window comes up.  Also, sometimes, when I zoom in to add a line of text or something, I will zoom the screen back out, only to have the screen go blank, and seem to re-load, and the text or option I put in isn't there.  Sometimes this happens randomly as well.  I will sometimes barely touch the screen, and the entire thing will reset.  The web app seems to be VERY unstable when using cell phone browsers.  I've tired running the online app on Safari, Firefox, and Brave, and all of them have the same problem with the zooming that I have to do to even read the apps text, or click it's buttons.  ",
