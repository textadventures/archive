      "EditableText": "It would be easiest if you had the aslx file from the original game. If you made it using the online editor, you can get this by using the download button on the \"your games\" page.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have the original file, it's possible to extract the *compiled* aslx from a published game; but this isn't ideal.\r\nTake the .quest file, and rename it so the extension is .zip - then open it and extract the file `game.aslx`.\r\n\r\nThis is where you start having problems.\r\nBy default, a new game will use 2 libraries: `Core.aslx` and `CoreEditor.aslx` (or `GamebookCore.aslx` and `GamebookCoreEditor.aslx`). This enables the editor to show you the right tabs for the kind of game you are making.\r\nHowever, the `game.aslx` file you have now will include all the functions and types from `Core.aslx` - leading to a very cluttered editor. But somewhat more confusing, compilation strips out all the information about what the different tabs in the editor should look like, and whether an object inherits `editor_object` or `editor_room`.\r\n\r\nBefore you can do anything useful in the editor, you will need to insert a line near the start of the file. Openn your `game.aslx` in a text editor (vim is good, or notepad, or whatever you normally use).\r\n\r\nAfter the line:\r\n```\r\n<asl version=\"550\">\r\n```\r\nyou should add:\r\n```\r\n  <include ref=\"Core.aslx\" />\r\n  <include ref=\"CoreEditor.aslx\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you should be able to open your game. However, you are now editing a Quest 5.8 game, using the Quest 5.5 libraries that were included in it when it was compiled. (As soon as you open a game in the new editor, the file version will change from 550 to 580; which among other things means that any turnscripts in your game will no longer work.\r\n\r\nYou  will need to  modify these functions so that they call the function `FinishTurn` at a sensible time. You *may* be able to delete them from your game, and it will pick up the new versions from the current libraries. However, I don't know if this will lead to any other compatibility issues.\r\nThe functions that now deal with `FinishTurn` are:\r\n* `StartGame`\r\n* `ShowMenuResponse`\r\n* `HandleCommand`\r\n* `ResolveNextName`\r\n* `ResolveNameFromList`\r\n* and `FinishTurn` itself\r\n\r\nThere will also be a number of new features shown in the editor that won't work unless you remove the old versions of the functions that are responsible for implementing them.\r\n\r\nIf you have any more problems with this, I'm sure people would be glad to help. But the more complex stuff your game does, the harder it will be to make it work smoothly.",
