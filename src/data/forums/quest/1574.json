      "EditableText": "You can use more than two words in a synonym. Be aware of the order of your synonyms though - it sounds like you have set up this:\n\nlift off = lift\nlift off the = lift\n\nIf the player types &quot;lift off the cliff&quot;, Quest checks the first synonym and finds &quot;lift off = lift&quot;, so it translates the input to &quot;lift the cliff&quot;. The second synonym then doesn't match, so your &quot;lift cliff&quot; command doesn't work.\n\nTo resolve this, put your more detailed synonym first.\n\nA synonym should only be used once. If you set &quot;sound = audio&quot;, then it will translate all occurrences of &quot;sound&quot; into &quot;audio&quot;, so it will never translate it into &quot;noise&quot;.\n\nYour &quot;wear shoe&quot; command is hard coded, so it won't recognise the alternative names for &quot;shoe&quot;. Your command should look more like this:\n\ncommand &lt;wear #@item#&gt; if (#item# = shoe) then ... else msg &lt;You can't wear that.&gt;\n\nThis will allow Quest to recognise &quot;wear shoe&quot;, &quot;wear the shoe&quot;, &quot;wear the hi-top&quot; etc. It will also give a sensible response for &quot;wear hat&quot;, if there's a hat object in the room, and it will say &quot;I can't see that here&quot; if the player tries to wear something that doesn't exist. This is [i:3nrc3nuu]much[/i:3nrc3nuu] better than hard coding your commands.\n\nIt is of course slightly more work, which is why I introduced [b:3nrc3nuu]verbs[/b:3nrc3nuu] in Quest 4.0. You can get the same behaviour I just described by adding a &quot;wear&quot; verb to the shoe object - much much easier.",
