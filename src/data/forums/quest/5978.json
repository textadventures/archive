I know you can change POV perspective but could i essentially rename the NPC to player on the fly to save all the coding that looks for the player object?\n\nIn effect From a logical perspective it would be this. Turn Current player into a a pile of bones, transform the NPC perspective's Name/attributes into the player(Thus preserving all the code that would normally affect the initial player.)..While I think it sounds logical I could do this there might be a few moments in the game with no &quot;player&quot; Object at all",

Code must have all objects named differently.  \n\nIt might be possible to have your current player renamed with an alias however.  Then you could easily change the players appearance.  But...
