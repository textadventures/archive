      "EditableText": "Appologies for the delay in my response. My experiences in using screen readers with any text adventure system are less than stellar. The main problem lies in the fact that there's no option to clear the screen before new text is printed, so screen readers tend to reread the old text for several dozen moves back. For this reason I prefer interpreters with built-in sapi speech, and only recommend such to other blind friends. If all the old text was changed to a different color from the new text, I could key my screen reader to read the text in the color of only the new text, or if the old text were cleared altogether, simply place a box around the text display window and tell my screen reader to read everything in it upon change. Of course, I don't know how convenient it would be to program such optional display methods into the interpreter, where of course the sapi code already existed and worked well enough for my purposes.",
