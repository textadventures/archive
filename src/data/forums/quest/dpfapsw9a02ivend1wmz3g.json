I was playing Anchorhead and it said it saved, but when I tried to restore, it plays like it normally does.  Typing \"restore\" again says it failed.  Why is that?  Unless the game brings you to the very first screen again no matter what, I find that saddening.",

      "EditableText": "Well it is an Inform game, if that means anything.  And it does say to Play Online.  This particular game is a pretty long one, so I would assume there should be a way to save it.  I can play it on my phone using an app for IF games and continue where I left off, but the screen is so small and then the tiny onscreen keyboard... I was really hoping to play and finish it here.  I do not see a Save feature at the top right.  But in the game if you type \"save\" it says \"ok\".  And then when you start it, it asks if you want to \"restore\" your game by pressing \"r\".  But when I do, it just brings me back to the very beginning and says it failed... o_0\r\n\r\nEdit:  I tried to see if I could use the Quest interpreter itself and see if that would save the game, but now I can not find Anchorhead among the choices available.  I assume it is for online play only here, even though you can get it from other sources as a download.",

I have played Detective Land and that will save and restore it.  When saving it will ask what you want to save it under.  For Anchorhead it simply says \"OK\" and that is all it does.  It asks you nothing.  When I try to restore the game by pressing \"R\" at the beginning or typing \"restore\" during the game, it simply says it failed.  Is it a Quest issue or a game designer issue.  Again Detective Land loads a game on Quest.  Just not sure the issue with Anchorhead.  Thank you.",
