If you're thinking of things which are [i:3qrgm9oq]relatively[/i:3qrgm9oq] simple, but for some reason not quite obvious, I have a couple of thoughts.\n\nFor instance, the first time I used a light-source I expected it to change or override a room's dark attribute, so I was just checking the attribute dark. I had to do a bit of searching to find that &quot;CheckDarkness()&quot; specifically checks both the dark attribute and looks for light-sources in dark rooms.\n\nI imagine creating a maze should be possible by giving a few rooms similar alias's and a peculiar structure of exit connections. Not too hard technically, but it might be confusing to a newer user.\n\nIt might be helpful to know how to create an actual &quot;status checkpoint&quot; the player could be returned to when they die that restores more than just undoing the last few actions.\n\n[i:3qrgm9oq]Really[/i:3qrgm9oq] complex stuff obviously gets into using libraries or actually requesting new features in Quest itself. So, I'm assuming you are picturing a kind of FAQ list that would serve as an extension of the tutorial. These the kind of ideas you're looking for?",
