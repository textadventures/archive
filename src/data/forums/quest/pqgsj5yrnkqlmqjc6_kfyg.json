I want to be able to make a object visible after a certain verb is used. \r\n\r\nFor example there is a couch and the verb I added was \"search\" there is a USB set as a child object under the couch which I have set to be invisible. \r\nI have added the **make object visible** script so that once the \"search\" verb is used it would make the USB visible but the USB isn't listed at all, I just get **\"> search couch\"**.\r\n\r\nSo does any one know how I can have the USB be listed once the search verb is used?",

I tested it here and it depends about how your game is running, so you will have t take different approaches.\r\n\r\nIn my test game, I created a \" Vault room\" to store the USB drive in question, because I suppose it would be good have it created beforehand for description and specific verbs sake.

If you do so you will have the \"Couch\", the usual verbs and the \"search\" verb will be hidden.\r\n\r\nDont forget going to the \"verbs tab\" and scriping the \"move object\" code for the \"search\" verb.
