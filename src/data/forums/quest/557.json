      "EditableText": "Hi Steve\n\nYeah, the synonyms in typelib are causing the issue here, although I do strongly advise you to use MUCH shorter object names in code and use 'aliases' to get more verbose descriptions. \n\nBut whatever, here's an interesting tip that comes to mind. You can override/unravel typelib's synonyms (or anything else) by adding another library before it in your code...\n\ne.g. This little library would have solved your 'inside - into' problem without needing any changes (though as I say I think you ought to change the names you use anyway!)\n\n[code:jwy3wmmy]!library\n\n!asl-version &lt;311&gt;\n!name &lt;Override Type Library&gt;\n!version &lt;1&#46;00 24-Nov-2004&gt;\n!author &lt;MaDbRiT &#40;Al Bampton&#41;&gt;\n\n!addto synonyms\n\tinn - into = inn - inside\n\tcottage - into = cottage - inside\n!end[/code:jwy3wmmy]\n\nIf you save this as (say) 'fixlib.qlb' and then INCLUDE it into your game before typelib, it will (for the inn - into &amp; cottage - into errors only) fix your problem.\n\nI don't actually recommend you do this on this particular occasion, but thought you might find it interesting to see how you can fine tune what typelib does without actually altering the typelib code.\n\nAl (MaDbRiT)",

      "EditableText": "Hey Al,\n\nYes, I did get it to work by changing the name.  As far as the length of the name, I did try to shorten that as well and where I didn't, I changed the aliases and added other names that could work.  Ex: \"Go to the small country inn\" can simply be \"Go to the inn\"\nThis, of course, is helpful for those who wish to type everything and not take advantage of the display on the right side of the screen.  If you used that, you could simply double-click the small country inn and it would take you there.\n\nThat is a very interesting tidbit of information about adding the library.  I will keep that in mind for future use.\n\nThanks!",
