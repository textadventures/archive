      "EditableText": "I'm working on the startscript of a game right now, and I wanted that when it starts it plays a music file. The file is an mp3, so I can't run it in-game, but need to run it as an external file that opens with windows media player. However, I want that the focus should remain on the quest window when it opens, and you shouldn't see the windows media player opening. I saw there was some box to tick, I think it was &quot;not active&quot; or something like that, that was supposed to keep quest on top. It doesn't work. Is there some other way to make quest stay on top? Thanks",

There is also a chance that when QDK might be messing up the code or something, because the following code worked for me with my media player of choice. You could modify your code using this snippet as necessary, and drop your mp3 into your quest directory.

Also, ITID, what does &quot;opening with a WMP command-line argument&quot; mean? I'm not sure what that means; maybe that's why it didn't work.",
