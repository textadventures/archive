Regarding varying responses, I'm having trouble making basic if/then statements that are dependent upon a counter or attribute work via the web version of Quest. I would be grateful for a solution to what may be an easy problem.\n\nI would like for a character to respond differently to a &quot;speak to&quot; command the second time it occurs than upon the first, and in a different way still on the third occasion. Via the web version of quest, in which I do not have access to the 'Attributes' tab for an object, what is the easiest way to do this?\n\nI intend to introduce programming via Quest to children during the coming week, so I am grateful for any guidance that may be provided.\n\nThank you.\nSteve",

You do have a command called &quot;thecountdown&quot; which sets &quot;countdown&quot; to 0 on Smart Barry, but I don't know if you ever execute it. I'm also not sure why you would have such a command (but then, I don't know what you're doing).\n\nI think you should (at least) define an int &quot;countdown&quot; attribute on Smart Barry and init it to 0. That way the attribute will at least exist.",
