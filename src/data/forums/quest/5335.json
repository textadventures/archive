So lounge level 1, office level 1, bathroom level 1 etc.. then I would copy them all and rename them lounge level 2, office level 2 etc.. and for every level which I need.  since you said you want some things to change, then you can make what edits you want in the rooms and to all the objects in them for the next levels.  Then it's just a matter of triggering the restart, well lets say for example your player starts off in their bedroom and the level is won when the player reaches the office, then you could have it so that there is an exit from office level 1 to bedroom level 2, from office level 2 to bedroom level 3 etc.  And you could even rename the exit level 2, level 3 etc.",

Make a room called level 1 and inside that put all the rooms which are level 1 rooms like kitchen level 1, office level 1 etc  put your level 2 rooms all inside a room called level 2.  Then you can simply have the exits all go where you want them to.  Theres no need to hide the level 2 rooms whilst the player is in level 1 since the only way they should be able to get to them is through the exit to a level 2 room you make in the last room of level 1.",
