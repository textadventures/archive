This would make large games easier to make thus ensuring the progression of text based games in the future. Something similar to the dreamweaver check-in function would be brilliant, although the files would have to be hosted locally rather than on a server. \nAll feedback on the idea is appreaciated and welcomed.",

      "EditableText": "Well, how me and Elex do it is via MSN. There is a nifty little feature called the Share Folder which allows you to sync any files you put in there into your friends Share Folder, and vice versa. For example, I put the file Bob into the folder. Way over in merry old England Bob will pop up in the Share Folder on Elex's computer. She can open it, edit it, save it and close it, then hit the Sync button and whallah - I now have the exact same version of it as Elex.",
