Such as, I want the player to be able to pick up a convex lens - then is able to use that on a number of objects. Which are a photo, painting, memo, picture, book, bookcase. I have read some of the other posts about related questions and I got a bit confuse with all the codes and scripts (as I am not a programmer) however I managed to use this code on the convex lens after taking the object tab:\n\nif (not ListContains(Photo.displayverbs,&quot;Look Through Convex Lens&quot;)) {\n  list add (Photo.displayverbs, &quot;Look Through Convex Lens&quot;)\n}\n\nAnd this one on the convex lens after dropping tab:\n\nif (ListContains(Photo.displayverbs,&quot;Look Through Convex Lens&quot;)) {\n  list remove (Photo.displayverbs, &quot;Look Through Convex Lens&quot;)\n}\n\nWhich this did work, it made the verb &quot;Look Through Convex Lens&quot; pop up after taking the convex lens. However when click this verb on the Photo, it says &quot;you cant look through the convex lens it&quot;. I haven't added any code onto the Photo, Im guessing I probably need to? However im not sure what I am meant to be adding. Also how would I go about adding multiple items to this code? Or if I need to use a different code, how would I go about doing this.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
