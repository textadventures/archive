If I could figure out how to do it with the editor scripts i would not be on here asking for help.\n\nI didn't want a whole lot of other attributes like strength anyway, I just wanted to know how to send a death message and end the game when health = 0, and as 'health' is an option available by checking a box on the game features tab in the editor I thought the scripts in editor should let me do that without having to write code of my own.\n\nIf using 'health' as a game feature does involve writing code then I think it should not be offered as a feature in the editor. While I was looking for online advice on this yesterday I found a screendump of an earlier implementation, 5.3 or something, where the editor offered a space to write a death message when health reached 0. But that doesn't seem to be in the 5.6.1 version I am now using. More's the pity.",
