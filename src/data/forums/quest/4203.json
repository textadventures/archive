You may need to do scripting also for the &quot;unlock&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, and etc Verbs too.\n\nIt takes too long to explain where or how you do stuff on the GUI~Editor, as I'm busy right now, but if someone doesn't help you, after wednesday (feb. 26), then I'll have the time (hopefully), to be able to help you step by step in using the GUI~Editor.\n\n--------\n\nthree ways to share your game:\n\nopen up your game (*.aslx) file with notepad, wordpad, or notepad++ ( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a><!-- m --> ), highlight all the text~code of your game (ctrl+A), copy it (ctrl+C), and then paste (ctrl+V) it here:\n\n[code.]paste your game code here[/code.]\n\nbut without the dots (&quot;.&quot; 's) in the code brackets, here's an example:\n\n[code:trschqb8]&lt;asl version=&quot;540&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;Testing Game Stuff&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;d67ec73f-f879-4911-9d88-c02ea527c534&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2013&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:trschqb8]\n\nOR, you can within the GUI~Editor:\n\nat the top, there's a menu bar, find the button that looks like a piece of notepaper, it's between the &quot;play&quot; and &quot;?~help&quot; buttons. This notepad button is a toggle, switching between the GUI~Editor mode and the Code View (in-code) mode. When in the Code View mode, do the same as described above.\n\nLastly, simply add your game file as an attachment to your post.\n\n-------------------------\n\ngame.pov &lt;=&gt; player\n\nif (Contains (player,object_1) and Contains (player,object_2) and Contains (player,object_3)) {\n-&gt; MoveObject (player, room_2)\n}\n\nif the player (or: game.pov) contains object_1 and also contains object_2 and also contains object_3, then move the player (or: game.pov) to room_2",

      "EditableText": "Yes the #'s are required for the command pattern. In a command pattern, anything between them is used as a variable in the script.\n\nTo use a very simple example:\n\nYou have command pattern that says &quot;drink #object#&quot; and a script that says:\nif (object.liquid = True) {\n  msg (&quot;You gulp it down to quench your thirst&quot;)\n}\nelse {\n  msg (&quot;You can't drink that!&quot;)\n}\n\nThe part that says object.liquid stands in for anything the player might type, whether it's &quot;drink water&quot;, &quot;drink beer&quot;, or &quot;drink chair&quot;. Depending on what the player types, the script becomes &quot;if (water.liquid)&quot;, &quot;if (chair.liquid)&quot; etc. If the water or beer has an attribute that says it's a liquid, then it will print the first message, whereas the chair would have an attribute that says it is not a liquid, so the second message would be displayed. The point is, whatever object the player types in after the word &quot;drink&quot; will be assessed by the command script substituting the typed object for #object#.\n\nAlso, the scripts honestly look far more complicated than they really are, especially in the GUI view where everything is expanded to look bigger. I didn't know a line of code in Quest or anything else when I started, and since then I've taught myself not only Quest but the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jquery - you'll get there eventually <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

In a command pattern, anything between them is used as a variable in the script.<br/><br/>To use a very simple example:<br/><br/>You have command pattern that says &quot;drink #object#&quot; and a script that says:<br/>if (object.liquid = True) {<br/>  msg (&quot;You gulp it down to quench your thirst&quot;)<br/>}<br/>else {<br/>  msg (&quot;You can't drink that!&quot;)<br/>}<br/><br/>The part that says object.liquid stands in for anything the player might type, whether it's &quot;drink water&quot;, &quot;drink beer&quot;, or &quot;drink chair&quot;. Depending on what the player types, the script becomes &quot;if (water.liquid)&quot;, &quot;if (chair.liquid)&quot; etc. If the water or beer has an attribute that says it's a liquid, then it will print the first message, whereas the chair would have an attribute that says it is not a liquid, so the second message would be displayed. The point is, whatever object the player types in after the word &quot;drink&quot; will be assessed by the command script substituting the typed object for #object#.<br/><br/>Also, the scripts honestly look far more complicated than they really are, especially in the GUI view where everything is expanded to look bigger. I didn't know a line of code in Quest or anything else when I started, and since then I've taught myself not only Quest but the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jquery - you'll get there eventually <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
