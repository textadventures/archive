I thought I would mention, since I didn't see it documented anywhere, that for non-default (ie custom) prefixes and suffixes, you must have an alias as the program will not simply use the name. For the webeditor, even if you recheck 'default' it still remains blank. I have not submitted a bug on this as it could be working as intended.\n\nThe main problem I am having is that I am stymied as to how to make an unlisted/invisible/hidden exit. It does not need to ever become visible (its meant to be an easteregg). I have tried putting it in a object that is marked scenery and tried giving  the exit the attribute 'scenery'.\n\nSecondly, in the web editor you can declare a suffix for an exit. However in quest 5.0 (I don't think it has changed in 5.1.1 and am hesitant to update since I am using the 'ask' function) it is not an option. Can this be added via code and if so, what would it need to be?",
