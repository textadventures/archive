He gets \"kidnapped\" a couple times and eventually returns to your side during the course of the story.\nTowards the end of the game, he leaves you \"to get help\" and returns when you reach a certain part of the end.\nIt sounds complicated but I think if I keep your cat scenario in mind, I should be on the right track.\n\nThanks again,\nsteve",

      "EditableText": "Though you can do it as an afterturn event or turn event in each room, I did something like this as a \"timer\" agent. This way you do not have to repeat code in every room. \n\nHave a timer just check a made up \"isFollowingPlayer\" flag for the NPC, and then if the flag is true just move the NPC to quest.currentroom and maybe add in a random string from a table to display how the NPC arrives (i.e. \"Chancey stumbles in the room behind you.\" or \"The butler follows you in.\", etc.)\n\nI also had flags attached to rooms where I did not want an NPC to follow you. For example, Chicken Chancey (a made up NPC) won't follow you into the haunted mansion and if you go there after having issued him a \"follow me\" command, he'll run away to a non-mansion room and stop following you. In this case I mixed a \"nearClockTower\" flag with this so that if you're anywhere near the mansion's clock tower the NPC would chicken out and stop following. \n\nAnyhow, the timed agent is kind of nice and allows for the NPC to follow you at a different (real time) interval than a turn based script. In other words, if the follower was kind of a slow poke he might not follow you right away but eventually get there some 20 or 30 seconds later in real time, in which case you might see the following message appear \"...Chancey stumbles in the room out of breath.\" Or \"Chancey enters the room complaining,\"Hold up a sec... you go too fast, Stan.
