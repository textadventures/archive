      "EditableText": "There is no limit on using items that I am aware of. Is it possible that any of the script got erased during editing, I have had that happen before and did not catch it till I ran a check on all script. There is no need to make &quot;use on&quot; or &quot;give to' commands for objects unless you want them to move somewhere like into another object or give to another person. If you want an object to perform a simple task all you have to do is set up the verb in that objects window and write a script. Set up &quot;use&quot; as a verb for &quot;key&quot; then write a conditional script that says IF player has &quot;key&quot; or IF &quot;key&quot; is available for interaction THEN unlock door (the player types &quot;use key&quot; and the task &quot;unlock door&quot; is performed). You may want to set &quot;flags&quot; to insure better control of the action and appropriate response, EX -  set flag &quot;door open&quot; to on when player uses &quot;key&quot; and off when player types &quot;close door&quot; (flags are very useful in conditional scripts). Since the &quot;key and the &quot;door&quot; do not physically have to interact with each other this will work every time, it also allows you to set up an ELSE script that gives a custom response if the condition is not met (&quot;cant see that here&quot; is the prorams generic response when it can not verify an action for an oject within a given room). I don't know exactly how you have it written but I hope this helps.",
