If I have a heavy attack option I wan't the player to be able to deal more damage overall but have the ability for the enemy to get a good attack, so like from 0-10 or 15, skipping out 11-14 altogether. Likewise with a defensive attack to deal lower damage but have the ability to completely miss enemy attacks.\n\nTo me this would add alot to combat, and if its possible any help would be appreciated. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
