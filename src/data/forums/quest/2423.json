I finally succeeded in getting the room layed out and the unlock exit works great (if you can find the hidden items to make it work).  My next task is to make the health counter which is set to decrement by 3 on every action reset to its orginal value upon entering the newly unlocked room.  I have an idea but most of my ideas run around in circles until I finally hit on one that works.  If you have any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nAlso i am curious as to whether or not the QDK 4.1.4 program I have downloaded is complete on my computer.  The reason I ask this question is after many, many months of writing and editing my original story (part 1) as an interactive novel what happens if, for whatever reason, Axe Software discontinues running the Quest programs? Do I have all the files I need to continue editing and releasing my current story as well as the many editions to follow without any kind of online support to run the program? I've done some checking and I know that Quest has been out for some time and there is a new version in the works so this may seem like a dumb or ignorant question but it is a thought that crossed my mind.\n\nThanks to Axe Software for creating this program, it is nice to have an interesting and interactive way to share my story; hopefully it will take me no more than a year to get the first book/game out.",

The player will be reusing rooms in this story and that is another area I will need to work on, any rooms set up as health resets will remain that way but I will probably want to modify the room for future visits (add some things and story parts while taking other things and story parts out).  I have the QDK Tutorial printed out but trying to convert its basic info into what Im trying to do is a little frustrating at times and I have glanced at parts of the other guide but mostly what happens is I get the info on how to write commands (for instance) and the help line says they are for processing any player input - which is great (I have a find #object# command I would like to use as an in game hint/tip guide for when the player gets frustrated).  I need &quot;find&quot; to work individually for each object that the player might need help with without putting it in the verb box where it is automatically assigned to that obect.  When the player gets stuck trying to find hidden objects they will most likely type in find# thatobject#, since the object is hidden the game wont see it so the player gets no response and typing find with another object name doesnt make sense when they will be asking for help with the hidden object. The problem is the guide doesnt explain in detail (or at all in some cases) how to circumnavigate these types of issues, I want the command to be specific to its assigned hidden object (even if I use the word 'find' multiple times I need it to respond to its assigned object insteads of giving me its origaally assigned text no matter what I type in).  I will probably have many issues to come but this is where I am at right now, any advice and help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have made good progress though, the first room is completely layed out with assigned text.  The hidden objects and associated verbs/actions work admirably, the health meter counts down and if you complete the room you can unlock the door to the next area.  Next is to reset the health, figure out an independent 'find' command that works, upload the background pic for that room and find some music for it.  The new area will be an even longer learning curve as it is a building consisting of nine rooms, yee haw!",
