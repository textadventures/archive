However, I found something on the Stack Overflow site which suggested 'z-index: 99999;' as a solution to someone's stacking problem, and low and behold when I added it to the [b:1335q6vs]div#gamePanel[/b:1335q6vs] class in my CSS it worked!!\n\nThanks, J <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
