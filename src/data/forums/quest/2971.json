Is there anyway to set it up like &quot;player, yourself, you&quot; ect to where typing any of those keywords is read the same way and runs the associated script?\n\nAlso...when using 'If' do you have to add an &quot;else&quot;? I want to make it so if a player has a certain flag one of the characters move to a different room after you leave. I've managed to set it all up fine and it works if add an else, but I don't really want anything to happen if the player has no flag. In other words, I don't want any alternative action to happen. Do I just leave it blank?",
