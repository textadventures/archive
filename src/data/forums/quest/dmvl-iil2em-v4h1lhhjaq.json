Click on InvCount in the attributes list again and click on Add Change Script.\r\n6a.  Click on the change script.  It should be named changedInvCount\r\n6b.  To this section add:  If object attribute equals Object home Attribute InvCount = 0, 'then' print message, \"It appears you have everything you need to win the game.  Now just to get back home.\"  Or something like that.  This would be good assuming that the final object isn't picked up in the 'home' room.\r\n7a.  Go to the room 'home' and click on the Scripts tab.  Add this to the 'After entering room' section.\r\n7b.  Add another 'If' script.  Add this:  If object attribute equals Object home Attribute InvCount = 0\r\n7c.  Then:  Run whatever scripts you want to run at the end of the game.  (see optional below)\r\n8a.  Go to each object that is required to have in your inventory at game end.  Under the take option, switch the choice from 'default' to 'run a script'.  Make sure you add the following script first.  Add to inventory 'this object's name'.  \r\n8b.  Add to this same script the following... Set variable -- home.InvCount = expression home.InvCount - 1\r\n9a.  If you can drop the object, then you need to reverse 8a and 8b.  Go to the drop option under the inventory tab for this object and add 'move object to current room - 'this object' and add Set variable -- home.InvCount = expression home.InvCount + 1\r\n9b.  If the object is not able to be dropped, then ignore step 9a.\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n10.  If you want a message to print when you enter the room if the player is not carrying all that they must be to win the game, you can add 'Else If' scripts to the changedInvCount 'If' script.  In the 'Else If's here just do this:  Add a script here and choose object attribute equals Object home Attribute InvCount = x         ..... where x equals the number of objects remaining needed to win the game.  You could add a 'print message' script like \"It appears you are getting close to winning the game, but you are still missing 'x' number of items.  Good luck hunting for them.\"  Or, something like that.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I tinkered on Quest, but this is a solution I became familiar with and used it quite often in my games.  Someone out there, if this is not a reasonable solution, please point out my errors or a simpler way to get it done.  I guess the complexity of the game-end script here is largely dependent on how many objects are needed in the inventory to win the game.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please let me know!
