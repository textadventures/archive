      "EditableText": "Hi, \r\nIs there any way to reorder the generated room descriptions.  I read in the forums that you would be able to do this in the 5.2 beta version, but I don't know where to find it in the 5.6.2 version that I'm using.  All I'm looking at doing is to have the room description first, like this:\r\n As you walk through the entrance, the door slams loudly behind you. You turn to leave, only to find that the door is no longer there. As you reach the center of the room, there is a blinding FLASH. Slowly your eyesight returns. \r\nYou are in a corridor.\r\nYou can see a sign.\r\n\r\nThanks",
