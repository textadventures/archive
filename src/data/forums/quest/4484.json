      "EditableText": "The problem isn't the move object command. The problem is that you haven't established your character. You have a player called &quot;obj_player&quot;, but you haven't specified that it is the default player. So Quest automatically creates a default player object when you start the game. \n\nYou have two options:\n\n1) Rename your &quot;obj_player&quot; to simply be &quot;player&quot; so that Quest can find it (that is the default name), or\n2) Set &quot;obj_player&quot; to be your default player. To do this:\n     i) Click on the &quot;game&quot; object\n    ii) Select the &quot;Player&quot; tab. You'll see here it talks about creating a default player for you if none is specified. (I think the text there is a bit strange, as it doesn't explicitly say &quot;Set the default player&quot; but rather talks about what object to read status attributes from, which confused me even though I knew what I was looking for.)\n    iii) Choose &quot;obj_player&quot; from the dropdown list.\n\nThat should do it. One thing that's a little disconcerting is that you have it where you don't see a room description when you enter a new room, so you'll have to explicitly type &quot;l&quot; to see where you are.",
