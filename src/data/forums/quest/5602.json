I know the only real way to apply anything to a room is to use it's &quot;Scripts&quot; tab. As I said though, I don't know how to apply that to a &quot;Room Object&quot; in the scripts tab. Like...is that a &quot;Set Variable&quot;, or a &quot;Get Input?&quot; <br/><br/>So either way works, but I just want to know what the best way is <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> and how to implement it.<br/><br/>I mean hell, this could also open up a movement randomization thing as well. Like, for example...<br/><br/>When exiting a room, you could potentially get one of three or four different randomized rooms. So each playthrough would be different. But I'll save that until the search area, and combat system are implemented. One thing at a time! (I wish!)",
