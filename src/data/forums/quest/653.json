Is there anyway to fix this?\n\nI'm planning a complicated RPG battle system at the moment, and am having some problems. The plan is to stick enemy or character names in certain 'slots' for battle and refer to their stats etc. during battle. Thus I was wondering:\n\nHow do give each enemy object values for hp, strength etc. (for the characters i'm just using variables eg. char1hp) and set flags onto them for things like ability to cast spells or status conditions\n\nI want to set a variable (eg. monster1) to the name of the enemy selected, and then refer to the aforementioned values easily. How can I do this?\n\nIs there any easy way to quickly sort the 5 to 8 characters/enemies into order according to their speed value, and then execute a procedure that is dependent on if its a character or not?\n\nHow can I check to see if a variable starts with a certain word (eg. Attack (something))?\n\nIs it possible to have a variable in a variable? For example, if a variable \"attack type\" is set to poison, can I easily check to see if an enemy has the flag \"resist #attack type#\"?\n\nAnd finally, how can I give each enemy object a procedure that I can refer to later (eg. one for choosing how to act in battle, then refer to it later to run the #enemy1# procedure #act#)?\n\nOkay, I think that's it for now.
