I made a little dialogue that looks something like this:\n[code:1tuho8wg] msg (&quot;'Hello&#46; Can you help me young man?'&quot;)\n get input {\n   if (IsRegexMatch  (&quot;(yes|of course)&quot;, LCase (result))) {\n     msg (&quot;I am thirsty&#46;&quot; , the old man says&#46; &quot;Bring me some water and I shall reveal to you bla bla bla&#46;&#46;&#46;'&quot;)\n   }\n   else {\n    }\n}\n[/code:1tuho8wg]\n\nThe problem I am having is that I do not want the conversation to end if I write something that is not handled by the script. For example if I write something unexpected, like: &quot;Who are you old man?&quot;, the conversation ends without any explanation and I have to restart the whole conversation from beginning. This is not a problem when you have just a few lines, but imagine having to go through a whole series of dialogue choices only to have it end suddenly without any explanation. Is there a way to add a line that says something like: &quot;Try rephrasing.&quot; and then automatically repeating just the last question. I think this would be useful for more complicated dialogues.\n\nThanks in advance.",

There seems to be a red line that says:\nFailed to load script&#058;\nmsg (&quot;I am thirsty.&quot; , the old man says. &quot;Bring me some water and I shall reveal to you bla bla bla...'&quot;)\n\n2. So I fixed this by deleting the red line and adding again a new message with the relevant text, but even though I don't see any errors - the script still does not seem to work. I cant find &quot;old_man&quot; within the game. So, assumed that it was because &quot;old_man&quot; was located within my &quot;old man&quot; object, so I moved him manually to my room. Now, I can see him in the game, but when I click on him there is no socialize command and manually typing socialize with old man does nothing either.\n\n3. Other than that, I noticed also that you created a new function called &quot;socialize_old_man_function&quot; and a sub-object called &quot;old_man&quot; within my &quot;old man&quot; object. This sub-object has a new verb &quot;socialize&quot;. The thing is that I want to be using the default command &quot;speak to&quot; because I think that is the first thing any player will try. If that doesn't work, I don't think anyone will even try to &quot;socialize&quot;. So is there a way to make this run through the default &quot;speak to/talk to/talk with&quot; command that comes built in by default in quest?\n\n4. I remembered this a bit later, but it would also be useful to have a way to exit the conversation by typing &quot;bye&quot; command.\n\nSome final notes: Basically I want to be able to get to special screen that is only for the dialogue with the NPCs - something similar to the old Legend games. I will even add NPC's picture once you type in the &quot;speak to&quot; command, and I don't want the conversation to end just because you might do a typo or try something that is not handled by the script.

Can you please try explaining it in more detail, cause I cant make any sense of this?<br/><br/>Specifically the script seems to come in 2 parts and I don't know how to combine them.<br/><br/>PS. I even tried using dialogue with menus as found here:<br/><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest5.net/wiki/Conversations\">http://quest5.net/wiki/Conversations</a><!-- m --><br/><br/>But these scripts seem to have exactly the same problem. Once you choose an option, the menu disappears and you have to restart the whole conversation. So i have no idea how to fix this problem.<br/><br/>I also tried downloading Media:ConvTutorial.aslx from the page to get a better insight into the coding behind it, but I cant seem to download it. I just get &quot;save target&quot; when I right click on the link, instead of &quot;save to&quot;. A total bummer...",

      "EditableText": "Sorry for not better explaining~helping you Mareus, and thanks for helping out Jay, as well. I've been too busy to try to give a better explanation, due to real life (I had a really busy last 2 weeks, sighs).\n\nI know your frustration, it took me a long time to get where I am now (search this forum for: HK's noob help me thread), as I was even worse off than you, I was confused by just all the terms themselves, lol.\n\nAlso, it's further frustrating that it takes you (me, I mean) like 8 hours to code something in, and then the good coders here, do the same thing, better: more efficientently (less code lines, less characters), more cleanly~neat~easy to understand, and faster, than your (mine, I mean) code, in like only an hour... Sighs, I'll get there... but right now it's still very slow learning and in writing~crafting code for me, hehe.\n\n-----------------\n\nlet me try to explain quest's coding structure, so you can be able to use code given to you\n\nthere's two types of stuff in quest's coding:\n1. the 'things', which are known as ELEMENTS, and have the 'tags', as shown below:\n\nBeginning tag of the entire game code: &lt;asl&gt;\nEnding tag of the entire game code: &lt;/asl&gt;\nAll code must be in-between them, obviously\n\nyou can do either horizontal or vertical writing~typing of code, though vertical is easier for code noobs, like me and you. As, horizontal requires you to know coding extremely well, beimg an expert at coding.\n\nhorizontal:\n\n[code:1t1oytey]&lt;asl&gt;your_entire_mass_of_game_coding&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:1t1oytey]\n\nvertical:\n\n[code:1t1oytey]&lt;asl&gt;\n  your_entire_mass_of_game_coding\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:1t1oytey]\n\nand the other ELEMENTS:\n\n(All of the ELEMENTS also hold attributes too)\n\nAttributes (holds data): &lt;attr&gt;&lt;/attr&gt;\nFunctions (holds scripts): &lt;function&gt;&lt;/function&gt;\nTurnscripts (holds scripts): &lt;turnscript&gt;&lt;/turnscript&gt;\nTimers (holds scripts): &lt;timer&gt;&lt;/timer&gt;\nObjects (holds other objects and attributes): &lt;object&gt;&lt;/object&gt;\nExits (connects room obejcts): &lt;exit&gt;&lt;/exit&gt;\nCommands (holds scripts): &lt;command&gt;&lt;/command&gt;\nVerbs (holds scripts): &lt;verb&gt;&lt;/verb&gt;\nObject Types (holds attributes): &lt;type&gt;&lt;/type&gt;\nThe Game Object (settings and other stuff for your game): &lt;game&gt;&lt;/game&gt;\nTemplates (holds message scripts): &lt;template&gt;&lt;/template&gt;\netc etc etc\n\nnow, hopefully you notice the indenting of the 'your_entire_mass_of_game_code'  within the vertical structure of the 'asl' tag example above.

I've been too busy to try to give a better explanation, due to real life (I had a really busy last 2 weeks, sighs).<br/><br/>I know your frustration, it took me a long time to get where I am now (search this forum for: HK's noob help me thread), as I was even worse off than you, I was confused by just all the terms themselves, lol.<br/><br/>Also, it's further frustrating that it takes you (me, I mean) like 8 hours to code something in, and then the good coders here, do the same thing, better: more efficientently (less code lines, less characters), more cleanly~neat~easy to understand, and faster, than your (mine, I mean) code, in like only an hour...

As, horizontal requires you to know coding extremely well, beimg an expert at coding.<br/><br/>horizontal:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl&gt;your_entire_mass_of_game_coding&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>vertical:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;asl&gt;<br/>  your_entire_mass_of_game_coding<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>and the other ELEMENTS:<br/><br/>(All of the ELEMENTS also hold attributes too)<br/><br/>Attributes (holds data): &lt;attr&gt;&lt;/attr&gt;<br/>Functions (holds scripts): &lt;function&gt;&lt;/function&gt;<br/>Turnscripts (holds scripts): &lt;turnscript&gt;&lt;/turnscript&gt;<br/>Timers (holds scripts): &lt;timer&gt;&lt;/timer&gt;<br/>Objects (holds other objects and attributes): &lt;object&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br/>Exits (connects room obejcts): &lt;exit&gt;&lt;/exit&gt;<br/>Commands (holds scripts): &lt;command&gt;&lt;/command&gt;<br/>Verbs (holds scripts): &lt;verb&gt;&lt;/verb&gt;<br/>Object Types (holds attributes): &lt;type&gt;&lt;/type&gt;<br/>The Game Object (settings and other stuff for your game): &lt;game&gt;&lt;/game&gt;<br/>Templates (holds message scripts): &lt;template&gt;&lt;/template&gt;<br/>etc etc etc<br/><br/>now, hopefully you notice the indenting of the 'your_entire_mass_of_game_code'  within the vertical structure of the 'asl' tag example above.
