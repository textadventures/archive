      "EditableText": "Nah, these forums could use a few more posts. Anyway to do that youâ€™ll probably need to use object properties. Give the weapon a property of â€˜weaponâ€™ a â€˜attackâ€™ with a value of 5. Do the same with monsters, give them the property â€˜monsterâ€™ and a defence property with a numeric value. You can refer to them in script with #(weapon):attack#, which would get the value of the weaponâ€™s attack. Anything with brackets around them contains a variable name. The format is #object:property#.\nHopefully you can make some sense of that.<!-- s:roll: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\" /><!-- s:roll: -->",
