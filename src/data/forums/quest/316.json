Is it possible to allow something like that in Quest?  Would they be able to also name their house?  I haven't yet found any script commands that make use of input boxes, but then I'm not very familiar with Quest yet.",

Then make the command open an existing location, which you create before hand but has no access to begin with.  Include in scripting an \"out\" command, which links to the location of the player when he or she types in the command \"build house\" or whatever the command is.\nNot really sure if you can have a user input name.\nHope this helps.",

But players can create/edit rooms, objects, properties, actions and just about anything else as long as you code them the commands to do so.",
