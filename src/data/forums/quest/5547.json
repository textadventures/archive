The line in question should look like this:\n[code:1tfkzzvz]MoveObject (player, room)[/code:1tfkzzvz]\nIf you can find [i:1tfkzzvz]MoveObject [/i:1tfkzzvz], you could type in &quot;player&quot;.\n\nIf you are editing offline, you could upload your game for someone to look at.[/quote:1tfkzzvz]\n\nThanks so much for your help. I have the flags set up for the door requirement and can get through it after speaking with the NPCs. The only problem now is what it does if you haven't spoken with the NPCs first.\n\nHere is how I set it up:\n[img:1tfkzzvz]http&#58;//i&#46;imgur&#46;com/qjgtWtg&#46;jpg[/img:1tfkzzvz]\n\nBut when I test it without having spoken to those NPCs I get this:\n[img:1tfkzzvz]http&#58;//i&#46;imgur&#46;com/mJE7rlr&#46;jpg[/img:1tfkzzvz]",
