I wanted to make gamebooks since I used to read Grailquest and Choose Your Own Adventures as a kid!  \n\nNow, I want to apologize if this is a stupid question, but I've spent the last hour trying to figure this out and I just can't get it to work.  I want to add a musical soundtrack to my gamebook.  I suppose you do this by adding scripts directly into the code.  I looked into the wikie, and it says you add this:\n[i:1noxi3k6]\nplay sound (string file, boolean wait, boolean loop) [/i:1noxi3k6]\n\nnow, I know nothing about coding so I'm not sure how to input the info into this example.  this is the code for my entire game:\n\n[code:1noxi3k6]&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;2&#46;4515&#46;34846--&gt;\n&lt;asl version=&quot;520&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;GamebookCore&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;Space Wanderer&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;8aba4b93-69a5-455c-9aee-3f06d3ef1d86&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;Page1&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;You awake naked in a cold room&#46;  Dim light descends from electric lamps above you&#46;  There are no windows or doors; but there is a hooded stranger watching you from one of the room's corners&#46;  You hesitate, and then speak&#58;&lt;/description&gt;\n    &lt;options type=&quot;stringdictionary&quot;&gt;Page2 = &quot;Who are you?&quot;;Page3 = &quot;Where am I?&quot;&lt;/options&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;defaultplayer&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;Page2&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;This is page 2&#46; Type a description here, and then create links to other pages below&#46;&lt;/description&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;Page3&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;This is page 3&#46; Type a description here, and then create links to other pages below&#46;&lt;/description&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:1noxi3k6]\n\nFirst, where do I input the command?
