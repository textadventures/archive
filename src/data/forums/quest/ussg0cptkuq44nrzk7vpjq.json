Is there going to be a desktop Quest version for Mac anytime soon? Or will the online version be updated to match the desktop version?\r\n\r\nI just can't really do what I wanted to do anymore.",

Like custom attributes; rather than entering them in the editor's \"Attributes\" tab, you have to create a script that sets them.\r\n\r\nI'm in a similar situation on linux. But I figured that working around the limitations is less stressful than trying to get it to run locally.",
