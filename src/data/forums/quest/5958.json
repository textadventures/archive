There are numerous ways to go about doing it, I may be able to start you on one of them --- if I can remember how to do it correctly.

Create a word document/or excel spreadsheet called &quot;Full Data Extended List&quot; \n**Second, write down [i:vfy1daeu][b:vfy1daeu]ALL [/b:vfy1daeu][/i:vfy1daeu] of the stats you'll want to be using. For example, \nStrength\nAgility\nDefense\netc\n***Third, write down ALL of the races, and then divide the stats among them exactly as you would like to make them appear in the game. Trust me, this will all save you TONS and TONS of time in the long run. Use this Document/Spreadsheet and add changes to it accordingly as you create your game, in case you want to go back later and add stuff to it.\n\nWith that said...we can get started. \n\nI imagine you'll want to allow the player to name their character? If not, you can skip this step. \n[u:vfy1daeu]First[/u:vfy1daeu]\nGo to your &quot;Tree of Stuff&quot; and click on &quot;game&quot;\nSecond, select the &quot;Script&quot; tab.\nNext under &quot;Start Script&quot;, create a &quot;Get Input Script&quot; \nInside that script put this code.\n[code:vfy1daeu]player&#46;alias = result\nClearScreen\nmsg (&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Pleased to meet you, {player&#46;alias}&#46;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;) \nAskQuestion[/code:vfy1daeu]\n\nAnd that should allow the player to name themselves. \n\nFor the Creation Process...you may want to define your stats first.\nStrength\nDefense \netc. \n\nSo to add them to the &quot;Player Pane Window&quot; (so that the player can see it)\nYou go to your &quot;tree of stuff&quot;, select &quot;player&quot; and select the &quot;Attributes&quot; tab. \nAfter that, you'll see three groups of data --- &quot;Status Attributes&quot;, &quot;Inherited Types&quot;, and &quot;Attributes&quot;\nGo to the &quot;Status Attributes&quot; and select &quot;Add&quot;\n\nNow you'll need a &quot;key&quot; and a &quot;value&quot; \n[u:vfy1daeu]Key[/u:vfy1daeu]                [u:vfy1daeu]Value[/u:vfy1daeu]  (the value is what the player will see in the player pane while playing the game)\nstrength                     Strength: ! \ndefense                      Defense: ! \netc\n\nAfter adding in all the stats you're going to use for these races, you move on down to the &quot;Attributes&quot;.\nFrom here...\n[u:vfy1daeu][i:vfy1daeu]Add[/i:vfy1daeu][/u:vfy1daeu]\n[u:vfy1daeu]Name[/u:vfy1daeu]                     [u:vfy1daeu]Value[/u:vfy1daeu]\nrace                                  unknown  (string)\nstrength                           0                (integer)\ndefense                            0                (integer)\netc \n\n*BTW SPELLING IS IMPORTANT AND SO IS CONSISTENCY.

For example,\nstrength of arms\nStrength of Arms\nstrength_of_arms\nStrength_of_arms\nStrengthofarms\n\n^ these are ALL different according to Quest. So if you put something in the status attributes &quot;keys&quot; as a lowercase, then the attributes must match, and so must all objects having to do with what you're creating, otherwise nothing will work.\n\nAnyway....\n\nNow, create a &quot;Object&quot; called [i:vfy1daeu]fulldata [/i:vfy1daeu](or whatever you want to call it)\nNext, in that &quot;parent&quot; create another &quot;Object&quot; called [i:vfy1daeu]race[/i:vfy1daeu]\nAfter that, select race --- and find the &quot;Attributes Tab&quot; and then &quot;Attributes.\n[i:vfy1daeu][u:vfy1daeu]Add[/u:vfy1daeu][/i:vfy1daeu]\n[u:vfy1daeu]Name[/u:vfy1daeu]                                            [u:vfy1daeu]Value[/u:vfy1daeu]\nlist                                                           (find and select &quot;string list&quot;)\n                                                                [i:vfy1daeu]Add[/i:vfy1daeu]\n                                                                human\n                                                                elf\n                                                                etc.\n\nNext, you may want to add descriptions to the &quot;Set-Up Tab&quot; of race and let the player know what stats they'll be getting when they choose a particular race, or you can add descriptions there, etc.\n\nFrom there...I forget what to do.

Then at run time, I have an attribute on the player called something like &quot;race&quot; that will eventually be assigned one of those objects.
