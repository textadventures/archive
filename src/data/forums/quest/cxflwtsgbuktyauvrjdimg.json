I used to be able to do this back then, as i once made horror story on here with sounds, images, and all the hyperlinks were fine. So it leaves me to wonder if everything else works, whats wrong with sound? \r\n\r\nPS: I retried it, and now its giving an error 404. Honestly, this is annoying me because it shouldnt be this hard. i like adding sound to these stories so you feel more in the moment, or have it be a product of ASMR for your enjoyment.",
