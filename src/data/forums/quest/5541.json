      "EditableText": "Hi,\n\nI've only just started using Quest. Years ago, I used to write 'choose your own adventure' style gamebooks for fun and I have a bunch of them I want to convert, but I'm wondering if Quest has the ability built into it to give a player an object, and then later on test whether or not they have that object.\n\nFor example, in one of my gamebooks, quite a few things that happen later in the book depend on whether or not the character put on their glasses early in the game. When I wrote the book, I had a lot of branches that read &quot;If you have your glasses turn to page 44, if you don't have your glasses turn to page 53&quot;. I could simply replicate that, but it occurs to me that technology might actually allow me to simply set some sort of flag, or assign some sort of object, that would handle that all automatically.\n\nNote, I am using Gamebook mode specifically - I may move onto more advanced IF text adventure style games later on, but my immediate priority is to work on my gamebooks.\n\nThanks for any help people can offer.",
