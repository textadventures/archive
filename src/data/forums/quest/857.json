Being 16bit, these have an absolute maximum size of 64kb each (1 'page' of 16bit memory = 64Kb).  Because Win 9x/ME is essentially underpinned by a 16 bit DOS base, these 16 bit heaps are in continual background use by the system.\n\nAlthough there are 32bit resource heaps in Win95 and later which do not have size limits for practical purposes, it is the two 16bit ones which cause trouble, because, being in constant use by the OS and many programs you run, if you have too many things running the space allocated for these resources cannot hold everything required.  At this point you get an 'out of memory' error (often preceded by a slow down of the PC) and the detail will often tell you of an 'Invalid Page fault' - where the program has tried to 'overflow' the resource space's 64Kb limit and tried to access other memory that it isn't allowed to do.\n\n[quote:2yfjgpfe]Either way, I agree with the \"ditch and get a new one\".

I also hooked it up to deal as a web/ftp/mail/PHP/SQL server too (as well as file-server). Prob gonna put Questnet on there if a game comes out. Of course it's nothing like a 'proper' server, as it's win XP, but I don't want domains etc at home <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> .<br/><br/>Enough of the talk... I'm off to download anything and everything from the web - just for the hell of it! Onto a windows XP machine with NO updates past SP2, no firewall/antivirus software at all...
