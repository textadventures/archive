I've got quite a few coding situations figured out but this whole timer situation is a bit confusing for me. I was hoping I can simulate the transit system by having a timer between each subway stop because as it is right now you can just get on and off the subway like there is no travel time. Can I make this happen? I'm finding all of this information explaining other situations a bit overwhelming on how to make it work for my situation.\nplease help!",
