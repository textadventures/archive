      "EditableText": "Okay... sorry in advance.\n\nIn my game I intend on having a flag set and unset called 'inside'.  Every time the player goes inside (indoors), the flag 'inside' is set.  I'm doing this so I can set up different description for my random bats that show up during certain times of the day.  Obviously, the description will differ depending on the time of day and whether or not the player is indoors or outdoors.  Whenever the bats have arrived when the player is indoors, there is a flag set called 'presentin' so the room description and arrival/departure of the bats has a proper description.  Note:  'presentin' doesn't mean that bats are ever indoors.  They are always outdoors but the player can hear them 'just beyond the walls.'  There is also a 'presentout' flag set when the bats arrive when the player is outdoors.  This much is established so far.\n\nMy problem is, that when the player moves outside (if the bats are present inside), they should be present outside, too.  But, in the current set up, the bats are absent whenever you go outside or whenever you step inside (from outside).  This is a problem because, later in the game, the absence or presence of bats will either prevent or allow the player to do something to progress the game.  If a player notices this, they can obviously go inside to outside to inside, etc, to take advantage of at least one turn when there are no bats present.  This is a no-no.\n\nMy solution would be this:  go into every &quot;inside&quot; room that has an &quot;outside&quot; exit and add a script that moves the bat objects to the outside room before entering the room if the flag 'presentin' has been set.  Of course, I would have to do the same thing all over again if bats are present outside when I go inside.  This seems like an awful lot of work and I would like an answer or suggestions to simplify this before I start moving around to every room in the game adding scripts so...\n\nmy question... is there some sort of universal command that I can apply one time for moving inside and one time for moving outside that will carry with it the status of 'presentin' and 'presentout' flags so I do not have to add scripts for every room where this applies?!?  Something in code that is a translation of &quot;if the 'presentout' flag is set, then set flag 'presentin' whenever the flag 'inside' gets set on the player.&quot;  I think the answer is right in front of me but after thinking of alternate solutions, I keep finding problems with it.\n\nAnd...

For example, you could create a type called &quot;Inside&quot; or &quot;InsideRoom&quot; or whatever you want. Then, you'd assign that type to all the inside rooms. (Or conversely, create an &quot;Outside&quot; type and add it to all the outside rooms. It depends on which is fewer or which you prefer to do. Maybe you're ok with adding a type to even all your rooms!)\n\nAssuming you add an &quot;InsideType&quot; type to your inside rooms, then you could have a function like:\n\n[code:c2370li7]&lt;function name=&quot;PlayerIsInside&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;\n    return (DoesInherit(player&#46;parent, &quot;InsideType&quot;))\n&lt;/function&gt;[/code:c2370li7]\nThen use that everywhere you're currently checking GetBoolean(Xanadu, &quot;inside&quot;). Moving the inside/outside responsibility to the rooms means you don't have to explicitly set and clear an &quot;inside&quot; attribute on Xanadu. You just look to the room to see where you are. (That helps if you happen to ever teleport the player. You won't have to work out whether they're transitioning inside to outside or vice versa. The target room will just tell you.)\n\nI hope that helps. I can look more if you wish. There were a couple of other things you could simplify (e.g. use the &quot;random&quot; text processor command instead of explicitly creating &quot;north&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;east&quot;, etc strings with all those if/elses), but that will do for tonight. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

This would allow me to add all rooms to this object type so whenever 'Xanadu' is in one of these rooms the flag &quot;inside&quot; is set, yes?\n[/quote:2trca68c]\nNot quite. The idea of creating a type is that, instead of even needing an attribute on Xanadu, you simply check the type of the room you're in. For example, in the real world, you look around you to see if you're inside or not, not look deep inside yourself.  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> Inside-ness is defined by where you are. Similarly, in your game, instead of having a state on Xanadu, you have the state be on the rooms, and then you just see what the state is for the room Xanadu happens to be in at that time.\n\n[quote=&quot;XanMag&quot;:2trca68c]\nNow... the whole goal is to have bats move to ALL outside rooms IF Xanadu is &quot;inside&quot;.  I want this because I want the bats outside if the player moves outside and IF they were present inside (&quot;presentin&quot;). \n[/quote:2trca68c]\nThis is the part I keep getting confused about. Wouldn't you want the bats outside as well if they're present? As far as I know, &quot;presentin&quot; means &quot;they became present when Xanadu was inside&quot;, but I still don't know why it matters where Xanadu was when the bats showed up. All that matters is that they're present. (Even what you say next doesn't help. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> )\n\n[quote=&quot;XanMag&quot;:2trca68c]So, I think I have a &quot;presentin&quot; conflict.  Whenever bats are present when &quot;xaninside&quot; is true, I need the bats to be present outside as well.\n[/quote:2trca68c]\nWell, yeah, they're present, period. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\n[quote=&quot;XanMag&quot;:2trca68c]\nI cannot set the script that controls this to run on &quot;presentin&quot; because it will totally mess up my printed messages.

Then I need move &quot;bats&quot; to rooms that do NOT contain &quot;xaninside&quot; attribute AND where bats &quot;present&quot; is true. \n[/quote:2trca68c]\nI'm assuming here that &quot;bats&quot; is a single object that follows Xanadu? If so, then do you mean you need to move the bats into a room that Xanadu enters when they're present and he's outside?\n\n[quote=&quot;XanMag&quot;:2trca68c]\nThat way, &quot;presentin&quot; messages print as needed AND the bats are outside if Xanadu goes from inside to outside.\n[/quote:2trca68c]\nI think the transition from inside to outside is immaterial. If you move outside and then move to another outside room, you still need to move the bats. So it's not the inside-outside transition that matters - it's moving from anywhere into a room that happens to be outside when the bats are present. Is that correct?\n\n[quote=&quot;XanMag&quot;:2trca68c]\nNote that different bat objects (average bat, bats, enormous bats) are present at different times of the day (dusk, evening, midnight, dawn).  So, this would be an enormously complex if/else if script with nesting upon nesting...\n[/quote:2trca68c]\nYou can simplify this by having a &quot;current_bats&quot; attribute somewhere, maybe on the game object. You would set that to average bats, bats or enormous bats depending on the time of day (probably in your turn script), and then just reference &quot;game.current_bats&quot; everywhere instead of checking the time of day every time you need to manipulate the bats.\n\n[quote=&quot;XanMag&quot;:2trca68c]\nWhat I currently have working:\nA.  I already have my time of day turn script set and it runs smoothly.\nB.  I have my random bats script working (bats arrive with frequencies related to the time of day, messages print when bats arrive/depart when Xanadu is inside/outside)... EXCEPT for when Xanadu transitions from inside to outside or outside to inside.\n\nMy point is (I think!??):\n1.

This would allow me to add all rooms to this object type so whenever 'Xanadu' is in one of these rooms the flag &quot;inside&quot; is set, yes?<br/></blockquote><br/>Not quite. The idea of creating a type is that, instead of even needing an attribute on Xanadu, you simply check the type of the room you're in. For example, in the real world, you look around you to see if you're inside or not, not look deep inside yourself.  <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> Inside-ness is defined by where you are. Similarly, in your game, instead of having a state on Xanadu, you have the state be on the rooms, and then you just see what the state is for the room Xanadu happens to be in at that time.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>XanMag wrote:</cite><br/>Now... the whole goal is to have bats move to ALL outside rooms IF Xanadu is &quot;inside&quot;.  I want this because I want the bats outside if the player moves outside and IF they were present inside (&quot;presentin&quot;). <br/></blockquote><br/>This is the part I keep getting confused about. Wouldn't you want the bats outside as well if they're present? As far as I know, &quot;presentin&quot; means &quot;they became present when Xanadu was inside&quot;, but I still don't know why it matters where Xanadu was when the bats showed up. All that matters is that they're present. (Even what you say next doesn't help. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> )<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>XanMag wrote:</cite>So, I think I have a &quot;presentin&quot; conflict.  Whenever bats are present when &quot;xaninside&quot; is true, I need the bats to be present outside as well.<br/></blockquote><br/>Well, yeah, they're present, period. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --><br/><br/><blockquote><cite>XanMag wrote:</cite><br/>I cannot set the script that controls this to run on &quot;presentin&quot; because it will totally mess up my printed messages.  So, my solution is this:  If 'presentin' is true, then I'll need to create a &quot;present&quot; flag to be true as well.  Then I need move &quot;bats&quot; to rooms that do NOT contain &quot;xaninside&quot; attribute AND where bats &quot;present&quot; is true. <br/></blockquote><br/>I'm assuming here that &quot;bats&quot; is a single object that follows Xanadu? If so, then do you mean you need to move the bats into a room that Xanadu enters when they're present and he's outside?<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>XanMag wrote:</cite><br/>That way, &quot;presentin&quot; messages print as needed AND the bats are outside if Xanadu goes from inside to outside.<br/></blockquote><br/>I think the transition from inside to outside is immaterial. If you move outside and then move to another outside room, you still need to move the bats. So it's not the inside-outside transition that matters - it's moving from anywhere into a room that happens to be outside when the bats are present. Is that correct?<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>XanMag wrote:</cite><br/>Note that different bat objects (average bat, bats, enormous bats) are present at different times of the day (dusk, evening, midnight, dawn).  So, this would be an enormously complex if/else if script with nesting upon nesting...<br/></blockquote><br/>You can simplify this by having a &quot;current_bats&quot; attribute somewhere, maybe on the game object. You would set that to average bats, bats or enormous bats depending on the time of day (probably in your turn script), and then just reference &quot;game.current_bats&quot; everywhere instead of checking the time of day every time you need to manipulate the bats.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>XanMag wrote:</cite><br/>What I currently have working:<br/>A.  I already have my time of day turn script set and it runs smoothly.<br/>B.  I have my random bats script working (bats arrive with frequencies related to the time of day, messages print when bats arrive/depart when Xanadu is inside/outside)... EXCEPT for when Xanadu transitions from inside to outside or outside to inside.<br/><br/>My point is (I think!??):<br/>1.

For example, it might make sense to put a &quot;changed&quot; script on &quot;presentin&quot;, so that when you set it to true or false, you can then catch the change and then handle things. (That also might not make sense. I'll think about it some more.) But the idea is to see if we can break the code up a bit and have it handled more discretely, rather than all in one place.<br/><br/>Another example is handling the moving of the bats based on the room movement rather than in the turn script, as I had proposed before. We'll see how it all pans out. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",

I'd put the code inline for those not wanting to download the file, but it's too much text for the website to allow. So snippets below.\n\nWhat you will notice now is that there are a lot fewer &quot;if&quot;s than there were before. I did this by creating objects for the various times of day and moving functionality and data onto them. For example, &quot;evening&quot; looks like this:\n\n[code:vz1r8g34]    &lt;object name=&quot;evening&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;dirtpathdescription&gt;The market to the east is completely deserted, save the bats&#46;&lt;/dirtpathdescription&gt;\n      &lt;bats type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;evening bats&lt;/bats&gt;\n      &lt;startinside type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n        MsgWithBr (&quot;The room has grown quite cold&#46;  Despite the growing darkness in the room, you can see a cloud of microscopic water crystals every time you exhale&#46;&quot;)\n      &lt;/startinside&gt;\n      &lt;startoutside type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n        MsgWithBr (&quot;The sun has fully retreated leaving the dark sky and the stars to keep you company&#46;  It is quite chilly out here now&#46;&quot;)\n      &lt;/startoutside&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n[/code:vz1r8g34]\n\nThat keeps you from having to check the current time of day all over the place. You just request the information you need from the current time of day. The code handling the time now simply sets the &quot;currenttime&quot; attribute to the desired object, and the rest of the code feeds off of that. (There's even a changed script for &quot;currenttime&quot; that handles outputting the correct description and updating what the current bats should be.)\n\n[code:vz1r8g34]    &lt;changedcurrenttime type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n      Setcurrentbats (this&#46;currenttime&#46;bats)\n      if (XanaduIsInside()) {\n        do (this&#46;currenttime, &quot;startinside&quot;)\n      }\n      else {\n        do (this&#46;currenttime, &quot;startoutside&quot;)\n      }\n    &lt;/changedcurrenttime&gt;\n[/code:vz1r8g34]\nOne critical piece now is that each time of day can have a &quot;bats&quot; attribute, which points to the bats object that should show up at that time of day. I had to add another one - dawn and evening were sharing the original &quot;bats&quot; object, but the behavior was different. So I broke it out to separate &quot;dawn bats&quot; and &quot;evening bats&quot; objects. Since they had so much in common, I also broke the common bits out to a &quot;batsbase&quot; type.\n\nI also renamed &quot;bats2&quot; to &quot;evening bats&quot;, since it fit the new pattern and seemed more descriptive.\n\nEach of the bats objects now hold the text to show when they arrive or leave (both inside and outside) as well as the arriving and leaving chances used in the random code. This allows the code to reduce down to the common structure, without all the special cases. This is your bats turn script now:\n\n[code:vz1r8g34]  &lt;turnscript name=&quot;Random Bats TS&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;enabled /&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;\n      if (not GetAttribute(game, &quot;currentbats&quot;) = null) {\n        if (BatsArePresent()) {\n          if (RandomChance(game&#46;currentbats&#46;leavechance)) {\n            BatsLeave\n          }\n        }\n        else {\n          if (RandomChance(game&#46;currentbats&#46;arrivechance)) {\n            BatsArrive\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/turnscript&gt;[/code:vz1r8g34]\nAs you can see, it is the essence of what you had duplicated for each case, now driven by the currentbats. No need to check all the different types, as the currentbats handles that for you.\n\nBats have additional fields now like this, which are used to generally handle things related to them (this is for the &quot;dawn bats&quot;):\n\n[code:vz1r8g34]      &lt;arrivechance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;80&lt;/arrivechance&gt;\n      &lt;leavechance type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;20&lt;/leavechance&gt;\n      &lt;arriveinside&gt;A terrible chewing and scuttling noise can be heard from beyond the outermost wall&#46;&lt;/arriveinside&gt;\n      &lt;leaveinside&gt;The incessant gnawing and flapping outside have subsided for now&#46;&lt;/leaveinside&gt;\n      &lt;arriveoutside&gt;As if by command, the bats are flying in unison toward the northern horizon&#46;&lt;/arriveoutside&gt;\n      &lt;leaveoutside&gt;The shrieking bats have disappeared into the northern dawning sky&#46;&lt;/leaveoutside&gt;\n[/code:vz1r8g34]\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. I think I have one bit of behavior change: when the bats leave at the change of time of day, they now announce their departure, as they would otherwise. That differs from what you had before, where the bats would suddenly be gone.\n\nAnd after all that, if you move around outside while the bats are present, they continually move to where Xanadu is:\n\n[code:vz1r8g34]  &lt;type name=&quot;Outside&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;enter type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n      if (BatsArePresent()) {\n        BatsFlyToXanadu\n      }\n    &lt;/enter&gt;\n  &lt;/type&gt;[/code:vz1r8g34]\nI hope the code is set up now in a way that is easier to maintain. If nothing else, you can see all the attributes for a particular time of day in one place (including the add-on description for the dirt path).

I'm still unsure how what is seen in the GUI translates into what is happening in the game, but when I look at it in code, I at least can understand what you did to make those things happen.  Perhaps this is why I've heard the code coders hear say it's easier to write in code than use the GUI specifically.   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: --> \n\nAnyway, I have two questions...\n\n[quote=&quot;jaynabonne&quot;:rkq0yy87]  Also you had bat objects that weren't used (large bats, small bats, enormous bats). They were moved to the Item Warehouse but never out of it. Not sure what was supposed to happen with those. Maybe work in progress...[/quote:rkq0yy87]\n\n1.  I initially had them move to the outside room that Xanadu was in when they arrived so that the player could look at them individually.  Then when I had the bats leave, I moved them out.  Without mucking up what you have created so far, is there a way that I can easily make them visible when they are present?  Currently, at midnight, when the player types 'x enormous bats' they get the response that they cannot see that when obviously they should be able to see that based on the 'x bats' description.  It's kind of a nit-picky thing, but I would like them to be visible for inspection.\n\nCould I just add a move object [insert bat type here] script to the function below when they arrive and then add a move them to the 'Item Warehouse' script when they leave?  And, if I do that, will they &quot;follow&quot; Xanadu like they are supposed to when he changes outside rooms (or will I have to also move them as well with Xanadu as you did the 'bats')?\n[code:rkq0yy87]if (not GetAttribute(game, &quot;currentbats&quot;) = null) {\n  if (BatsArePresent()) {\n    if (RandomChance(game&#46;currentbats&#46;leavechance)) {\n      BatsLeave\n    }\n  }\n  else {\n    if (RandomChance(game&#46;currentbats&#46;arrivechance)) {\n      BatsArrive\n    }\n  }\n}[/code:rkq0yy87]\n\n2.  When Xanadu is inside, he should not be able to see the bats, only hear them.  Currently the bats are indoors with Xanadu.  I could easily make them invisible when Xanadu goes inside any &quot;inside room&quot;.  I don't know that option will work however because I'd like an 'x bats' input to return something like &quot;Thankfully, you can see no bats here, but you certainly can hear them outside.&quot;  Also, I think with what you have done with the bats, there is probably a much easier way to do it than what my hack solution would be.\n\nDoes that make sense?

I'm still unsure how what is seen in the GUI translates into what is happening in the game, but when I look at it in code, I at least can understand what you did to make those things happen.  Perhaps this is why I've heard the code coders hear say it's easier to write in code than use the GUI specifically.   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: --> <br/><br/>Anyway, I have two questions...<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>jaynabonne wrote:</cite>  Also you had bat objects that weren't used (large bats, small bats, enormous bats). They were moved to the Item Warehouse but never out of it. Not sure what was supposed to happen with those. Maybe work in progress...</blockquote><br/><br/>1.  I initially had them move to the outside room that Xanadu was in when they arrived so that the player could look at them individually.  Then when I had the bats leave, I moved them out.  Without mucking up what you have created so far, is there a way that I can easily make them visible when they are present?  Currently, at midnight, when the player types 'x enormous bats' they get the response that they cannot see that when obviously they should be able to see that based on the 'x bats' description.  It's kind of a nit-picky thing, but I would like them to be visible for inspection.<br/><br/>Could I just add a move object [insert bat type here] script to the function below when they arrive and then add a move them to the 'Item Warehouse' script when they leave?  And, if I do that, will they &quot;follow&quot; Xanadu like they are supposed to when he changes outside rooms (or will I have to also move them as well with Xanadu as you did the 'bats')?<br/><pre><code>if (not GetAttribute(game, &quot;currentbats&quot;) = null) {<br/>  if (BatsArePresent()) {<br/>    if (RandomChance(game&#46;currentbats&#46;leavechance)) {<br/>      BatsLeave<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>  else {<br/>    if (RandomChance(game&#46;currentbats&#46;arrivechance)) {<br/>      BatsArrive<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</code></pre><br/><br/>2.
