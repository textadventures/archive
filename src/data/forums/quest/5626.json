Thinking about it, it may be best to have it return a string, so you use it only what what the player actually says. So this would become:<br/><br/>msg(&quot;'&quot; + LanguageAlgorithm(&quot;Oh, hello,&quot;) + &quot;' you say to the goblin.&quot;)<br/><br/>You need to change the code slightly too. If the player is a bimbo return one thing, if a male model return another and if neither, return the string unaltered.<br/><pre><code>if (player&#46;speciality = &quot;bimbo&quot;) {<br/>  s = Replace(s, &quot;&#46; &quot;, &quot;&#46;|&quot;)<br/>  s = Replace(s, &quot;! &quot;, &quot;!|&quot;)<br/>  s = Replace(s, &quot;? &quot;, &quot;?|&quot;)<br/>  ary = Split(s, &quot;|&quot;)<br/>  l = NewStringList()<br/>  foreach (t, ary) {<br/>    t = Trim(LCase(t))<br/>    if (RandomChance(50)) {<br/>      t = Replace(t, &quot; and &quot;, &quot; and like &quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    else if (RandomChance(50)) {<br/>      t = Replace(t, &quot; you &quot;, &quot; you like &quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    else if (RandomChance(50)) {<br/>      t = Replace(t, &quot; you &quot;, &quot; you totally like &quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    else {<br/>      t = Replace(t, &quot; and &quot;, &quot; and like totally &quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    t = CapFirst(t)<br/>    list add (l, CapFirst(t))<br/>  }<br/>  return (Join(l, &quot; &quot;))<br/>}<br/>else if (player&#46;speciality = &quot;male model&quot;) {<br/>  s = Replace(s, &quot;&#46; &quot;, &quot;&#46;|&quot;)<br/>  s = Replace(s, &quot;! &quot;, &quot;!|&quot;)<br/>  s = Replace(s, &quot;? &quot;, &quot;?|&quot;)<br/>  ary = Split(s, &quot;|&quot;)<br/>  l = NewStringList()<br/>  foreach (t, ary) {<br/>    t = Trim(LCase(t))<br/>    if (RandomChance(50)) {<br/>      t = Replace(t, &quot; and &quot;, &quot; and like &quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    else if (RandomChance(50)) {<br/>      t = Replace(t, &quot; you &quot;, &quot; you like &quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    else if (RandomChance(50)) {<br/>      t = Replace(t, &quot; you &quot;, &quot; you totally like &quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    else {<br/>      t = Replace(t, &quot; and &quot;, &quot; and like totally &quot;)<br/>    }<br/>    t = CapFirst(t)<br/>    list add (l, CapFirst(t))<br/>  }<br/>  return (Join(l, &quot; &quot;))<br/>}<br/>else {<br/>  return (s)<br/>}</code></pre>",
