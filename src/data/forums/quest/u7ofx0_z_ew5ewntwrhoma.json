      "EditableText": "I'm creating a quiz and started off by creating a room for a question, which I called Q001. To create multiple answer choices I then created rooms for four different answers. Q001a, Q001b, Q001c and Q001d. The idea was to allow the player to click on one answer (room), create a script to increase the score if they got the answer right, and jump straight to Q002. Essentially the player would not see Q001a, Q001b etc.\r\n\r\nHowever a 100-question quiz would be 500 rooms. Not unmanageable but messy, so I wondered if I should be creating four objects for the room instead. The problem with this is that I only want them to be able to click on the hyperlink and it automatically run the relevant script and take them to the next question. Instead I have to set a verb on that object so when the player clicks the hyperlink a drop-down box appears, which is not necessary if there is only one verb. I want to circumvent that part and just have the player taken to the next question. To summarise: I want to create a clickable object with no drop-down that automatically takes the player to the next question. Is this possible?\r\n\r\nWhich approach is best? Rooms or objects for the multiple choice answers? Or is there an easier way that I'm over-looking?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
