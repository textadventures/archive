It should make it so the player can skip a certain portion of time-consuming actions while still receiving the necessary items that would have been acquired in that skipped area.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'm being clear. If I am, you can skip this part. Here's an example of what I mean:\r\n\r\nThe course of action for the player would be\r\n1. go south\r\n2. look at Object A\r\n3. open Object A\r\n4. take Object B\r\n5. go north\r\n6. go east\r\n7. look at Object Y\r\n8. use Object B\r\n\r\nLet's say I've already tested 1-7 and it works, but for some reason 8 does not work. Rather than go through all steps again, I want to be able to type in a code word at the beginning (instead of \"go south\") and it will jump me to the location of Object Y and give me Object B automatically so that I can test step 8 over without the time-consuming repetitive process of 1-7.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!",
