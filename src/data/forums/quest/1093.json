What i was trying to do was if- something, then- (another if-then statement) \nWhen it goes into the second if-then, it seems to not work... is it just something i'm doing, or is it the programs limit?",

I have not tested for this limit, but it appears that two if..then..else's in a main if..then..else cause the problem you are seeing.\n\nIf you edit you file in a text editor then it appears there is no limit to the complexity.\n\nMy advice would be to make you code simpler by doing the first if..then..else but setting flags in the 'then' and 'else'.  Then write a stand-alone second (third....) if..then..else (i.e. not nested) which tests the flags and perform the operations you want.",

It generally happens within the IF/THEN window.  First you create your IF bit, then fill in what happens in the THEN window but if you add another if statement within the ELSE window, you most likely will get an error.  Today I was working on one where I had \n\n[code:1pecyule]IF flag â€œwhateverâ€ is set, \n           THEN \n                    &#91;If player has whatever object, \n                                   THENâ€¦whatever, whatever\n                                               ELSEâ€¦whatever, whatever&#93;\n           ELSE\n                    Type message â€œwhatever, whateverâ€\n                    Turn on flag â€œwhateverâ€[/code:1pecyule]\nOk thatâ€™s pretty generic but I hope you understand what Iâ€™m saying.  The above scenario did not work.  Before closing all the windows out, I could see red font which means an error is sitting in there.  What finally worked was putting what I had in the ELSE window as a procedure and just calling that procedure instead of putting all the commands there (which confuses the IF/THEN system).  But in the following scenario that worked, I changed some things around and even started with â€œif the flag was offâ€â€¦\n\n[code:1pecyule]IF flag â€œwhateverâ€ is NOT set,\n                       THEN\n                                  Run â€œnewâ€ procedure &#40;which originally was my ELSE message&#46;&#41;\n                       ELSE\n                                  &#91;If player has whatever object,\n                                                THENâ€¦whatever, whatever\n                                                              ELSEâ€¦whatever, whatever&#93;[/code:1pecyule]\n\nAnd separately, I have my â€œnewâ€ procedureâ€¦\n\n\t[code:1pecyule]Type message â€œwhatever, whateverâ€\n\tTurn on flag â€œwhateverâ€[/code:1pecyule]\n\n\nMake sense at all?
