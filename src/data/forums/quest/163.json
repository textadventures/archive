An example of this would be a command for perhaps painting; 'PAINT SIGN BLUE'(with sign and blue both being string variables). As far as I know, Quest doesn't really have a way to tell the compiler when one string variable ends and another begins. I was thinking perhaps it would be convenient to implement some syntax for command lines that lets Quest know, the characters up until a space are the variable to be entered. I guess perhaps something like this...\n[code:3bdyincp]\ncommand &lt;paint #object-variable#_#color-variable#&gt;\n[/code:3bdyincp]\n\nOr something similar to allow multiple variables to be entered instead of having to right a script to check for a space in each line and split the remaining text from each side into variables.\n\nUm, my other idea, I've spaced out right now, but I'll come back in a bit and toss it in.",
