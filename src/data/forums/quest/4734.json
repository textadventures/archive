I'm not a programmer and haven't had much luck figuring out how to create a new command that will work correctly. For example, I'm trying to create a situation where the player can &quot;look under&quot; something, and then it reveals an object underneath.\n\nI get how to create an object and print a message when the player uses this command (on a table, for example); I assigned an attribute called item_hidden to the table, so the program would understand to create a new object when the player looks under the table.\n\nBut the program creates the new object whenever I &quot;look under&quot; anything else in the game world. I only want it to reveal the item if it's the table!\n\nIf you &quot;look under the coconut tree&quot; I'd like it to reply with a default message telling the player that's not something you can look under.\n\nTHough I'm sure its simple, I can't figure out how to structure this correctly through the GUI. Any Suggestions?  <!-- s:( --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /><!-- s:( -->",
