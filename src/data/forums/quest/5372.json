      "EditableText": "Hi!\n\nMy problem this time is about moving the player to another room after a long chat. The problem is that i dont get this action at all (and i know it should be easy!).\n\nSo whats happen in the game is this:\n\nPlayer use his office computer\n\nPrint: you broke it. Another dude tell you &quot;i will tell the boss about this&quot;\n\nChoose 1,2 or 3\n\nPrint: &quot;ok. I will keep the secret if you do my work&quot;\n\nTHEN this what i need to happen:\n\nPlayer move to the kichen\n\nPrint: &quot;yeah. Know you are the coffe dude haha&quot;\n\n...\n\nI make the print appear but i dont know if the player was moved. All remains in blank or i get a error. \n\nIt should not appear the kitchen descripcion? Like when the player enters in the regular way. At least thast what i want, so he can make the coffe and keep exploring the office.\n\nFor unddestar the &quot;action&quot; &quot;move the player&quot; I even created a whole new &quot;game&quot; with only 2 rooms and a object that should move the player but all reminds in blank. \n\nWhat i am doing so wrong? (besides my english haha)\n\nThanks!",
