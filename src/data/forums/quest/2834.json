If you add the command &quot;set timer script&quot;  and add a new script to it (just a &quot;print a message&quot;), you get the internal error and after it the game in the editor is &quot;dead&quot;, you can't change any value/field any more without this error and new loading the game.\n\nAnd I think there is a problem with timers in the gui even with the offlineversion.
