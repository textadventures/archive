Found an old thread where you seemed to be saying that you can achieve a wildcard effect in a roundabout way:\n\n&quot;if you put as the description as &quot;it's a big red car&quot; and call it &quot;big red car&quot;... then you *should* put in the &quot;alt&quot; bit of the object; &quot;car,big red car, red car, big car&quot; ... my car won't work because you haven't said it's your car..&quot;\n\nI'm afraid I'm being a bit thick and can't follow the meaning here. What I was looking to do was simply create a wide range of things the player can type in that aren't necessarily related to moving around or manipulating objects, and elicit a response from an NPC. As an example, I wanted to cater for the puerile player who tests the limits of the game by typing in lewd suggestions, and have a curt or dismissive response come up. So I would want the Command to cover a range of swear words and phrases in different orders. Is this possible?\n\nThanks again! Sorry if this is something I should have worked out myself - I *am* using the tutorial and help file to work my way around the program, and it does look like an excellent and flexible piece of software.",
