      "EditableText": "Walls, floor, ceilings are everywhere in a room. I have a room filled with many rooms. If the player wants to look at the walls in one room and all the walls are pretty much the same, I can put an object called walls in the game branch of the tree instead of every room and let the same description be used everywhere. Ahh, but how do I call the description for walls when the player 'looks' at them?\n\nI'm speaking GUI here guys.I'm thinking a &quot;Get input&quot; and then an &quot;if result = walls&quot; script. Does the result have to be &quot;look at walls&quot; exactly or would &quot;climb walls&quot; bring the same description as &quot;Look at walls&quot; if I use this method. I saw this discussion somewhere before but when I search I get to many results and am told to narrow my search. \n\nWhat say ye?",
