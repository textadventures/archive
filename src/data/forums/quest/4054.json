      "EditableText": "chuckles, if I understand this stuff right, Alex doesn't have input validation, ie error exception handling, built into this aspect of quest's coding, as I think you're seeing the actual code of the quest engine trying to work on (your incorrect syntax of) &quot;list&quot;, through the error message, which confuses people (who don't know coding~programming at all) in what is wrong with what they have with their code line(s).\n\nInput Validation ~ Error Exception Handling, would give you a message like:\n\nif (Name_Attribute_of_Thing type &lt;&gt; &quot;simplestringlist&quot;) {\n-&gt; msg (&quot;That is the wrong syntax, please type in the syntax correctly for quest to be able to work ~ act upon this code of yours&quot;)\n}\n\nbut, instead you're seeing the actual code~processii of how quest tries to handle~run your code input. This is a big deal for security and thus for software coders, such as OS (operating systems, ie: windows 7), as hackers can take advantage of this, using it to get control of a user's computer. Email too, networking~routers~ports~firewalls~IPS~IDS, and etc, lots of coding areas~methods that must be protected from: SQL injections, Command Line injections, XSS, and etc.\n\n----------------\n\na huge chunk of programming is coding for input validation ~ error exception handling, as every wrong input by the user has to be accounted for, that's why software has so many patches (and tens of millions of code lines ~ well for OS' at least), to block these openings for hackers, and why patching~updating your applications~software, OS software, and etc computer stuff, is so important.\n\n-------------\n\nhere's an example of a (lack of) an in-game error exception handling:\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;age type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/age&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;function name=&quot;age_character_creation_function&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; msg (&quot;What is your age?&quot;)\n-&gt; msg (&quot;Please type in a number value&quot;)\n-&gt; get input {\n-&gt;-&gt; // (but, the user types in: &quot;twenty years old&quot;, instead of a number value)\n-&gt;-&gt; player.age = result\n-&gt; }\n&lt;/function&gt;\n\nthis would produce an error, as &quot;player.age&quot; is set to being an &quot;integer&quot; type, whereas the user's input is that of a &quot;string&quot; type.\n\nIt's a real pain to code in all these exceptions... and not easy to code either, as well... lol (at least for me).\n\nya, it's easiest to assume~hope, that someone will type in a number value (&quot;20&quot;), but what if they don't? You need to have code to address this problem, especially from a security standpoint, to prevent~block the actual program coding processii from being revealed~shown, as it tries to search for a way to act upon the user's invalid input.\n\n-------------\n\nhere's what the (quasi) code should look like:\n\n&lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n-&gt; &lt;age type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;0&lt;/age&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n\n&lt;function name=&quot;age_character_creation_function&quot;&gt;\n-&gt; msg (&quot;What is your age?&quot;)\n-&gt; msg (&quot;Please type in a number value&quot;)\n-&gt; get input {\n-&gt;-&gt; // (but, the user types in: &quot;twenty years old&quot;, instead of a number value)\n-&gt;-&gt; if (contains (result, &quot;a,b,c,...,z, !, @, and etc non-numerical symbols&quot;) {\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; msg (&quot;Use numerical symbols ~ number values, only please!&quot;)\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; age_character_creation_function // this code line calls upon this function again (they have to do it over again)\n-&gt;-&gt; } else if (contains ( - ..., -100, - ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., 100, ...) {\n-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; player.age = result\n-&gt;-&gt; }\n-&gt; }\n&lt;/function&gt;",
