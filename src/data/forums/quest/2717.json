The intro ends with the player typing the command &quot;use&quot; for the object &quot;car.&quot; When the player does this, I wan't a song to play, a picture to pop up, a text block to appear, and the player be transported to another room. However, I don't want the player to have to scroll up through all of this to catch it all.\n\nSo how do I make a script that will, when an action is used on an object (and in this order):\n\n- Start an MP3\n- Display a text block\n- Require the player to press a key to continue\n- Upon pressing a key, display a picture (the title picture)\n- Require the player to press a key to continue\n- Upon pressing a key, transport the player to another room\n\nIs there a way to make all of that happen just by typing &quot;use car?&quot;",
