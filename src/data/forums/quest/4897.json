After converting with build.phonegap, I install the apk on my phone and there is no sound when selecting Play piano. It plays the few second sound on windows pc, but not on phone. No sound will play. Also, I can click on the item to get a drop down menu to selct &quot;Take&quot;, &quot;Drop&quot;, etc...but after converting to the apk with phonegap build, the menu option does not work. Is this something that is not available at this time or is there something I need to do to get it working? Thank you.",
