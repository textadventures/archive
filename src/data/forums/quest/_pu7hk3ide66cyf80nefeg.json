What i want to do is write each story line for the different factions (kingdoms) as their own game, that way i can have those out and have people test them, reveiw them, and give ideas for changes, while i work on the main story lines, therefore being able to theoretically  almost double our productivity so the question is, is this reasonable or just a waist of time?",

      "EditableText": "Honestly, stop thinking this. It is never a game where you can do whatever you want. If so, i may say you are having very little success on pursuing this objective, as there is not \"soldier\", \"Tax collect\" or \"Noble\" at the character's list. \r\n\r\nI strongly recommend you on focusing. If you feel need, even skip a character creation and select a starting, fixed character for the player. If it is your first game, it may speed up things a lot. If you skip allowing player choosing things which are distracting you, it will allow you investing on presenting the player the choices which really makes the game special. On many Interactive Fiction, there is a budget problem: producers avoid having multiple story lines, because when you play and pick one, all the rest becomes unused work. Having multiple story paths grants you replay, but it becomes a huge nightmare to manage. If you want investing some time and effort about choices in the game, work on multiple story lines.\r\n\r\nAnother special suggestion for you is giving some color for your story. Many of the interactive fiction writers lacks the 'writer' component. I am not saying i am a blessed writer, but even celebrated IF writes has some problems when it comes upon writing. I still stumbling on the topic myself, but what i found is that IF is almost a book, but cannot be treated as a book entirely. It makes the challenge even more... challenging. So, give your player a little more context about the character, places and background. perhaps you may want writing  prologue. Something like \"It was a period of civil war. Rebel star ships striking from a hidden base has achieved its first victory against the evil galactic empire\" would be good enough. If you feel stuck, ask Copola.\r\n\r\nAlso, for writing sake, perhaps you may want to compose your game book using gender as a class component. So, you will have actually 6 classes, as two will be \"Farmer Boy\" and the other \"Farmer Girl\". It will help you focusing on the perspective of the right class and gender. You will also find it makes better for taking in account gender differences, like world view.\r\n\r\nI plan playing your work in progress once again soon to check if i may add anything else.",

For example, if describing about a bedroom (what i am actually doing at the moment), i scatter some of the details on different objects present at the scene.

The main problem about characters is Parser games does have a lack of identity for the \"player character\". When the game provides identity, it is minimum, as is somewhat expected the player fills the gaps in his/her mind because in general terms, the player IS the character. I believe this forces the parser games designers to skip making a solid character and, at other hand, they skip some dramatic elements. My main concern it would create a sort of sub-culture or etiquette or \"call it whatever you want\" that skips too much text and descriptions and i not be able to satiate the adequate demanded level of details and the pacing and format this public expects finding, making my games boring.\r\n\r\nWell, i guess i am rambling too much and not expressing myself in the adequate way.
