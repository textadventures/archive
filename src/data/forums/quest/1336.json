ASL was my first language apart from HTML, and it took me a while to get used to, which is why I did (and still do infact) use the QDK editor, and then make any necessary modifications to the ASL script later.\n\nThe ASL guide does help a lot, then it's just a case of (How you put it) trial and error.  I've been using several different languages and I stopped using ASL/QDK for a while, and when I came back to it I managed to pick it up more easily since it does have it's similarities to other programming languages.\n\nI myself have not done any programming classes.",
