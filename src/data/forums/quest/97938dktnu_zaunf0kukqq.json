But if I simply show or even enable this verb before the player actually did all these things, this would be a major spoiler, as the player knows the butler did it, on the knives are fingerprints and additionally, the order of the plot is destroyed. So the verb should only appear and be enabled, as the player fulfills all the requirements.\r\n\r\nI am very thankful, in advance, this has been bugging me for a long time!\r\n\r\nP.S.: Please explain it simply, as I am still a beginner",
