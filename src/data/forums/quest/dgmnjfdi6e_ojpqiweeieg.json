I thought ```game.parent.room``` was a real delegate.\r\nCan you tell me how to do this?\r\n\r\nAlso, I know it says ```game.glass``` instead of ```player.glass```. This is because the player can use potions to change into different things.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nP.S Whoever helps will get a special benefit when the game comes out sometime next month.",
