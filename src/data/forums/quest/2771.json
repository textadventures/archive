(The reason I had to deprecate the old functions and introduce new ones was that in Javascript you can't have threads - meaning that asking a question, waiting for a keypress or showing a menu can't pause a script while waiting for user input.)\n\nWaitForKeyPress is also deprecated (just updated the wiki to mention this) - you should use the &quot;wait&quot; script command instead.",
