If it helps any, the room is listed as an 'object and/or room'. I'm aware I can clear the description prefix on the room tab, but that doesn't seem to actually do anything as at the very top it will instead still state 'A _______'. (with the ____ replaced with the room name).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to remove the 'A' prefix too or am I stuck with it?",
