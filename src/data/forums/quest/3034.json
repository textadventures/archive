I have created a tech lab game so I didn't need to attach my actual game, and the problem happens with it as well, so I am consistant with my error!\n\nThe window is closed, and therefore locks the &quot;in&quot; direction. If you &quot;open window&quot; the game replies with &quot;you open the window&quot; and it unlocks the way &quot;in&quot;. If you then type &quot;close window&quot; it replies with &quot;it's already closed&quot;. \n\nI created another window for the next room, and it works just fine. I have no idea why this isn't working and it's really annoying me now. Can anyone help?",
