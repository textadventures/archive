Even if I get option A to work, moving skill objects to player inventory from elsewhere when I wan them to appear may cause skills to not appear directly under the in appropriate category in the status box.\n\nI am pretty sure I saw a script set for doing this by pixie or someone when I was browsing the other day but I can not find it now. Usually I've found it easier to just code from scratch anyways unless it requires commands I am not used to.\n\nShould I try using items as containers? I haven't gotten that far and am unsure if that is the right direction to go.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks",
