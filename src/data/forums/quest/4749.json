      "HTML": "Yes, I was just looking at that. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Gamebook mode, as game books don't support turnscripts. So I've been trying to find a different method, and I found one. (I hope you're using the downloaded desktop Quest. Otherwise it's probably not possible to do.)<br/><br/>An important note: BE SURE TO SAVE A COPY OF YOUR GAME FILE BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS.<br/><br/>You can use a &quot;roomenter&quot; game script attribute to perform the same function as a turnscript. Also unfortunately, the class name that code uses doesn't exist in GB mode either. So I came up with a bit of a hack. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> The code is this:<br/><br/><pre><code><br/>    &lt;roomenter type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>\t    JS&#46;eval (&quot;$('div&#91;id^=\\&quot;divOutputAlign\\&quot;&#93;')&#46;css('opacity', '0&#46;5');&quot;)<br/>\t    JS&#46;eval(&quot;getCurrentDiv()&#46;css('opacity', '1&#46;0');&quot;)<br/>    &lt;/roomenter&gt;<br/></code></pre><br/>That is an attribute to be added to the game object. You can do that in code view (if you dare!). It's not actually that hard. Here is what my game object looks like with the change:<br/><br/><pre><code>  &lt;game name=&quot;gbtest&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;1cbef79e-ceee-41de-a6fb-f268af68a718&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2014&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>    &lt;roomenter type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>\t    JS&#46;eval (&quot;$('div&#91;id^=\\&quot;divOutputAlign\\&quot;&#93;')&#46;css('opacity', '0&#46;5');&quot;)<br/>\t    JS&#46;eval(&quot;getCurrentDiv()&#46;css('opacity', '1&#46;0');&quot;)<br/>    &lt;/roomenter&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;</code></pre><br/>As you can see, the new roomenter attribute just needs to be inserted before the line with the &lt;/game&gt; closing tag.<br/><br/>If you get stuck, post your game file, and I'll add it for you and send it back.",
