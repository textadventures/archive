I have more, but I really want them to become TV shows instead.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"\r\nThe first one is about a man who adopts five daughters. It's a comedy. It's a Christian comedy. It's like a slice of life comedy. Also drama.\r\nBack when he was a teenager, he was an atheist. His father was abusive to him. He tried non-successfully to commit suicide a few times and so on his mother separated him from his father, and he got treatment for his bipolar disorder that he was diagnosed with. He converted to Christianity. He graduates out of high school, may or may not do a few odd jobs I suppose, and starts his own book publishing company. A rich man buys his company, and he becomes the owner of the most successful Christian book publishing book company in the US. Over time, he adopts five girls. And that's where our story starts. The jokes and set-up comprise mainly of the girls going to school and the man going to work. The girls, especially the middle child, pick on him because of his state of transgender-ism which make up some of the drama/jokes. He cross-dresses. But his life, religion, society, and other things won't let him be who he wants to be. Also the man's life and past gets subtly pulled into there.\r\nThe story is usually about the girls' lives, and has some sort of moral to the stories usually.\r\nI could go on about all their lives, that man's workplace and boss, the girls' teachers and friends, but that would take way too long and I am too lazy to write it.\r\n\r\nAnd this one is just drama. (With a bit of comedy because I wanted to)\r\nSo a long time ago some girl was dating some guy. The guy was abusive to her, and her brother and family disapproved of the relationship. But they thought they loved each other. They got married nonetheless. She became pregnant. The brother convinced her that the husband's violent outbursts would harm or kill the unborn child, and so somehow both he and the woman escaped from the abusive boyfriend. They called police. They got a divorce. No action could be made however, the man fled state and wound somewhere in Florida with another woman. Then the woman and her brother just lived together, and the brother got a job at a factory. The woman was in college. She gave birth to a boy. They name the boy Johnathon. Johnathon was cute and they both loved him very much. The brother could not live with the boy for long forever however. He had a secret. He was a pedophile. It was not that he was afraid of you know, just afraid of... how should I say... unwanted arousal. Nonetheless, when the kid was 5, he left. He said his goodbyes, and he left. He only told his sister his secret. He told his sister to tell the boy when he got old enough. He told no one else. There was one other reason he left too. He wanted to become a playwright. One of those guys that create plays. And he did. Well, years past. The boy aged to 15 years. His friends from school abandoned him, as friends sometimes do for some reason or another. We all have periods in our life like that. He is absolutely \"normal,\" meaning untalented, C and B average, Straight, cisgender. This is the time his mother and him move closer to his uncle, in some big city like Fort Wayne or Indianapolis in Indiana. This is where the show takes plays. The show then goes about the daily life of the boy as he tries to fit into High School. And his uncle helps him. Also the boy gets a friend who is asexual male. And also he gets a girlfriend who becomes a main character, but she ends up betraying him by listening to her friends more than him. He joins a basketball team. Some hijinks happen.\r\nI want to add spice to the story and increase sales, in case you're wondering. Controversy is a good way to do that, at the cost of temporarily turning off your TV and living like a hermit for about a month.\r\n\r\nIf you wanna know more about pedophilia just google it. My autism/Aspergers makes me obsess over things, my determination gives me arrogance. Or ask me and I'll google it. I've probably googled it already and got it stuck in my head already.\r\n\"\r\n```",
