I added the verb to the object, but when I write in the game &quot;hide under the hallway table&quot; or &quot;hide under the table&quot; I get no response whatsoever. I want to know why? The funny thing is when I write &quot;hide under table&quot; without &quot;the&quot; it works, so I am totally bummed out by this.

Is there a way to avoid such annoyances?\n\nWhat's even more confusing is the fact that if I create a command with a pattern: hide under table; hide under the table; crawl under table ; crawl under the table; etc. it works, but then I can't see the object options in the &quot;places and objects&quot; menu.
