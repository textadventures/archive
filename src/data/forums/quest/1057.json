I am constantly at work, and do not have a lot of spare time, so I'm posting these questions in hopes that they will be answered in my absence.\n\n\n#1 - I need to know how to make my main character's body an item. For example, if I wanted my caracter to be able to put on and take off clothes and armor, how would I script that? \n\n#2 - I know how to start my character off with items, but how to I make them accessible? In my test runs, when I try and interact with the items that are in my starting inventory, the game says there are no such items. \n\n#3 - I want to be able to have certain items appear only after certain conditions are met. Say there was a key inside a drawer, but the first time you searched it, you didn't see it. You'd have to search again, and notice that the drawer had a false bottom, and then the key would appear.\n\n#4 - I want to have locked rooms that need keys, but if I set a certain direction to come back to a print script, how do I add in the unlocking event (To allow the character to enter the room; go in that direction) later?\n\n\nNo rush to answer these, as I said, I work 6 days/50-60 hours a week. I'll just check back here later. Thanks in advance",
