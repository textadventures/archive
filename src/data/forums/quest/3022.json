      "EditableText": "I have a bow object and a bow string object. I added the &quot;combine with&quot; verb to the bow and told it it needed the bow string object. I then have the code creating the finished bow, adding it to inventory, and deleting the bow and string. But, when I click the &quot;combine with&quot; verb from the inventory screen, I just get an error and the text comes out as &quot;combine with bow string&quot;. I want it to come up with a list of inventory items and ask me which item I want to combine it with. And only do the combining if they have both objects. How do I do this?",
