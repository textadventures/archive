It helped a LOT when I figured out how off-track that was! Even so, I've never seen a multi-player text game before, and I'm having trouble picturing how the game-play would work. Is there one online somewhere that I could check out to see what it's like? Is it basically like &quot;World of Warcraft,&quot; but in text? Does MUD specifically mean a text based game, or just multi-player? \n(Just for the record, I don't play WoW, but I get how it works.)",

      "HTML": "I don't quite get what's being discussed here. I'm not even trying to understand the code, but the whole text-adventure MUD concept is confusing to me. At first, when I saw &quot;MUD&quot; my brain was thinking of &quot;SCUMM,&quot; so I thought you meant like &quot;point-n-click&quot; games. It helped a LOT when I figured out how off-track that was! Even so, I've never seen a multi-player text game before, and I'm having trouble picturing how the game-play would work. Is there one online somewhere that I could check out to see what it's like? Is it basically like &quot;World of Warcraft,&quot; but in text? Does MUD specifically mean a text based game, or just multi-player? <br/>(Just for the record, I don't play WoW, but I get how it works.)",
