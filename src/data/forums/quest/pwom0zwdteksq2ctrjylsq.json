There is a wide feather bed, a nightstand with a book on it, a mirror, and a cluttered looking dresser. Every surface is covered in random mathoms and any other random thing you've collected over your years of living here. The rain falls heavily outside, sliding carelessly down your round window.

I don't want the \"You can go to the hall\" To appear before the descriptive text, so currently I have the description in the description prefix.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is worded strangely, I'm very new to the program!",

      "EditableText": "It looks like you're putting the whole description in the prefix.\r\nThe prefix is for text like \"You are in\". If shown, it always comes before the name of the room.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to include this line, you can turn it off on the \"Room Descriptions\" tab of the game. Turning off the room name will also make the prefix disappear.\r\n\r\n> I don't want the \"You can go to the hall\" To appear before the descriptive text\r\n\r\nOn the \"Room Descriptions\" tab, there is a list of description parts.\r\n* Room name:\t1\r\n* Objects list:\t2\r\n* Exits list:\t3\r\n* Description:\t4\r\n\r\nIf you change their numbers to any other value between 1 and 4, they will appear in the order you give them. So the easiest way to make the room description appear before the \"you can see\" is to give \"description\" a lower number than \"Exits list\".\r\n\r\nIf you want to hide the room name, just give it a number that isn't 1, 2, 3, or 4. I think most people use 0 for this.\r\n\r\nIf you want the description to appear after the exits list normally, but to appear first for this one room, you can change the order for a single room.\r\nYou would make a \"Before entering the room:\" script:\r\n```\r\ngame.autodescription_youarein = 0\r\ngame.autodescription_description = 1\r\ngame.autodescription_youcansee = 2\r\ngame.autodescription_youcango = 3\r\n```\r\n(This hides the description prefix and alias, and moves the room's description to the top)\r\n\r\nand in your \"After entering the room:\" script, you'd put:\r\n```\r\ngame.autodescription_youarein = 1\r\ngame.autodescription_youcansee = 2\r\ngame.autodescription_youcango = 3\r\ngame.autodescription_description = 4\r\n```\r\n(this puts them back to the default order)",
