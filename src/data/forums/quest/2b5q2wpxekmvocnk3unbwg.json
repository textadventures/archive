      "EditableText": "Hi, everyone!\r\n\r\nQuite a few people have been asking about Quest 6 recently, and there are two main lines of questioning:\r\n\r\n1. I can use Quest 5 without really knowing how to code.  Will I be able to use Quest 6, or will it be more complicated?\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell from messing with the current code for Quest 6, it won't be any more complicated, but the layout will be a little different.  Like where you click on certain things might be on a different screen; little stuff like that.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure that anyone who can use the Quest 5 editor will be able to use the Quest 6 editor with little to no problems.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlso, Quest 6 won't be released until 2022 at the earliest; so, everyone discussing this is thinking fourth-dimensionally, as it were.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n2. What about the games I am currently authoring in Quest 5?  Will I be able to just switch over to Quest 6 and finish my game from there?\r\n\r\nErr...\r\n\r\n**Before going into all this:  Quest 5 is awesome and easy to use.  Quest 6 is going to be awesome and easy to use. It seems like they will be two different animals, though -- meaning no one will be forced to switch from Quest 5 to Quest 6, but Quest 6 will be advised when starting to create new games.**\r\n\r\n***...or that's my theory. I could be wrong, especially considering Quest 6 is still in development.***\r\n\r\n**Anyway, I'll expound further at the end of this post. Back to Question 2 . . .**\r\n\r\nIf a Quest 5 game is just a simple game (with no added scripts, just descriptions and such), it will probably load in the Quest 6 editor with few to no issues.\r\n\r\nIf a Quest 5 game is complex, though, it will probably not load everything correctly in Quest 6.  Depending on the complexity of the code, the author could probably rewrite certain things in JS to make them work, but some of the Quest 5 scripts used built-in Windows stuff to work, and some of that stuff will not be easy to modify to do the same *exact* thing with Javascript (although I assume most authors could figure out something that worked much the same way).\r\n\r\nAlso, as far as converting Quest 5 games to Quest 6 goes, it looks to me like we need to have the original ```.aslx``` file with the game's source code to load into Quest 6, not the ```.quest``` file (nor the ```.aslx``` file from within the ```.quest``` file).  Note that I may be wrong about this, but it seems that Quest 6's editor will load the same ```.aslx``` file that Quest 5's editor will currently load.  So, it doesn't really convert Quest 5 games; it actually just reads a Quest 5 game's source file <s>and takes the data from the XML (aka ASLX aka Quest 5 source code) and outputs everything it understands into a JSON file as it loads all the data into the editor.  After a game is loaded, it will save as a JSON (aka ASL6 aka Quest 6) file</s> from an XML, just like Quest 5 does.  (NOTE: I'm just talking about the files the editor saves during the creation process, not the finished game files we publish once the game is complete.)\r\n\r\nIf that is correct, then all existing Quest 5 games (the actual ```.quest``` files) will still have no way to be converted.  This is not a complaint or a request or anything of that nature, as I have gone down every possible rabbit hole to find a way to convert Quest 5 games and never found a method which could be considered successful (unless, again, I was dealing with very basic games with no added scripts, and there was an old converter which Alex Warren began to develop but then abandoned before it even reached its testing phase that would convert those super-simple games (sometimes)).\r\n\r\nNow, having said that (and thinking it is all correct), I have noticed that Pixie is dedicated to making sure that every Quest game ever created can run in Quest (on the desktop *and* online).  Backwards-compatibility was definitely one of Pixie's primary concerns during the update from Quest 573 to Quest 580, and I assume this is still the case today.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to the Quest 6 game runner.\r\n\r\nThere is no Quest 6 game runner, and that is point of Quest 6.  (And it's a damned good point! (Pardon my French.))\r\n\r\nQuest 5's only downside (to some users) is its dependency on Windows software.  This site has to have a server with ASP.NET and Azure to run the games online, and that is all Windows stuff -- and that is one reason why this site's game server frequently has issues (I think).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Quest 6 creates normal website files (comprised of HTML, CSS, and JS) which can be hosted anywhere and/or played in a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) from the hard drive.  In fact, I have a test Quest 6 game uploaded to this site, and when the server goes down and Quest 5 games won't run, I have tested it and can still play the Quest 6 game with no issues.\r\n\r\nSo, Quest 5 games have their own server that uses Windows software to run them on this site, and all other games published to this site are on a different server (I think) and independently run in a browser (definitely).\r\n\r\nIt appears that the forum comes into play here, too.\r\n\r\nI had to create an account to publish games.  When I created that account, my account was assigned a GUID, and my GUID is used to name the directory which holds my data (much like a Windows \"User\" folder), including my forum posts, game reviews, uploaded games, games created online, etc.  If I'm not mistaken, when playing any Quest games online, my game saves end up in their own directories with their own GUIDs inside of my main textadventures/*myGUID* directory, too.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Azure blobs are what the files are called, but don't quote me on that, as I have yet to fully research it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm getting sidetracked...\r\n\r\n- Quest 6 has no game runner.  Quest 6 needs no game runner.  This is the beauty of Quest 6 (or most of the beauty, besides being cross-platform).\r\n\r\n- Quest 5 games need a game runner.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking Quest 5 games will always need the current online game runner on a server just like the current one which is hosting this site.  I'm also thinking Windows users who don't wish to play Quest 5 games on this site will always need Quest 580 available to install to play their games from their local hard drives on the desktop.\r\n\r\nSo, here's my question for The Pixie:\r\n\r\n**What are the plans concerning the availability of the Windows desktop version of Quest 5 and the current web player?**\r\n\r\nI theorize there will be one final bug-fixing update for Quest 5, which will be applied to the web player as well as the desktop version.  After that, I bet the desktop version of Quest 5 remains available for download (I mean, all the previous versions of Quest are available, so this is pretty much a no-brainer, now that I think about it), and the current version of the web player remains online to play Quest games created before Quest 6.\r\n\r\nWhat about my theories concerning the editor, you ask?  Well, I bet once the Quest 6 editor is fully-functional, it replaces the current online editor -- rendering the Quest 5 online editor extinct.  I supposed (based upon no research nor any actual knowledge whatsoever) that the Quest 6 editor (being a React website at its core) will need a server with different roles than the current ASP.NET server.  (I also bet the React server is less costly AND has fewer problems, but I haven't researched this at all, either -- just a gut feeling.)",

Maybe I am doing something wrong in my game, maybe most games should not have that much verbs in which I am doing so because of lazy and amateur programming. But still if one wants to make many rooms, collapse and opening the folders can be quite a chore. I am not sure what is the best fix, but I definitely think it is not necessary to open the verbs file on game startup. Or perhaps 2nd solution, the game maker remembers what room folder you opened and what folder you closed during your last game making.\r\nI have used certain programs like infinite maze and programming style like verb action a/b/c/d to fix this issue but they are definitely not as good as having a more convenient game maker that does not forces you to do any modifications and restricting your style.\r\n\r\nFor Quest 5  game book, I want the game editor to be able to move into the same page as right now, so for example, if I move from page 2 to page 2, there will be an error, the game stops. This limitation forces me to make many pages, just to reroute the player back to page 2. Maybe I should just give an example, At page 2, Heal 20 hp. I want to heal again > go to page 2 again.",
