      "EditableText": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI wanted to add a certain aesthetic and  was wondering if it's possible to have your game appear on static image of a old computer screen. As in... I know that you can put images into your text adventure... but is it possible to put your text adventure ONTO an image, in a way that it would look like your playing on a old PC from the early 80's. Let me explain... \r\n\r\nI'm more of a modeler than a programmer. And while idealy I'd love to put my text onto the screen of this 3d model in a 3d enviorment (please correct me if I'm wrong) but I don't think Quest allows that. BUT I can model a 3d computer and render the image from a appealing angle then impose the text onto said render where it gives the same impression, it's a much easier method to program... but how? Is it possible? Or should I be looking to make this text adventure on a different program?\r\n\r\nI see you can input a \"background image\" while that does SOMEWHAT work, I was hoping to be able to arrange everything in a slightly different way..\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced Gents!\r\n-Porter",
