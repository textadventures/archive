Wrapping a Twine game as an .exe is pretty simple with nodewebkit, but it doesn't seem like there is an equivalent for Quest files. Any ideas on how to accomplish this? I've even thought about packaging the entirety of quest alongside the game, but I have no idea how to set it to auto-open the game file if I do that (and I imagine there would be copyright issues lol)",
