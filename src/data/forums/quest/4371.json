I started pretty good when work with only one item to buy. \n\nWhat I do was used the attribute &quot;If&quot; the player have the object ___ (coffee in this case), then print the message ___(&quot;you leave a tip&quot;).\n\nAnd add the attribute &quot;If&quot; the player dont have the object___ (coffe), then print the message__ (&quot;Is a little weird leave a tip without buying nothing)&quot;.\n\nRun fine but this method work only if I do it with a single object. If the player buy &quot;candy&quot; (for example) and not coffee then the tip jar print &quot;Is a little weird...&quot;. Because if I tried to put the same atribbute I mention before i more that a single item the game print a error.\n\nSo, what I want is the player can leave a tip buying whatever object want. I think I need something like:\n\n                          If the player have ___(coffe) and/or ____ (candy) then print____\n\nThe question is how I do that? Or what is the alternative?\n\nNote: \n1) I really, really, sorry for my bad english, is not my native language. \n\n2) I dont leave the game because is in spanhis. But if you guys think it will be useful let me know.\n\n3)  I really, really,really, really, really, really, sorry for my bad english, is not my native language.",
