I had this (late for halloween) way too ambitious idea of a story where your character is slowly transforming into a monster (werewolf or something I guess) while solving puzzles to find a cure.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that after a set amount of time the character's form will change a little bit (Think of it like status ailments almost like Transformed 0, Transformed 1, Transformed 2, Transformed 3, Game Over) and now all the previous interactions they had in the rooms will be replaced with new ones exclusive to your current form. The idea here being that it becomes harder and harder to do what you need to do the more you transform. Maybe you need to talk to an NPC to get a helpful item but  your current status is \"Transformed 2\" which causes an interaction where the NPC flees in terror instead of helping you etc. There would need to be a timer for each status change interval I'd assume...am I making sense? I hope I am! \r\n\r\nNow I realize that setting up something like this probably takes a lot of work and I don't expect people to just come in and hand me the code and fly away like Superman. I'm trying to learn how it all works and I really feel like this would be a fun game to make. I've looked at tutorials but they're all old and don't seem to correspond to version 5.8 (which I'm using) and I honestly just don't know where to start to get the exact result I'm looking for. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated, even if it's just a link to another thread or page that can help me with this particular thing.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read this! ",
