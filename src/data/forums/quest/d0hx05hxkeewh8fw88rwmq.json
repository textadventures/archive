I realized, though, that I have no idea how to \"kill\" a player or disable them from continuing to play the game after they triggered a trap. I could have a message displaying that they died, but nothing would stop them from continuing to play the game.\r\n\r\nBasically what I want to do is make it so the only thing they can do after dying is \r\n\r\n1. Reload a previous save\r\n\r\n     and/or\r\n\r\n2. Start over from the beginning. \r\n\r\nI understand that there is not an easy way to do a restart other than closing the program and reopening it, and that's fine. I just want to make sure they can't keep progressing through the game after they \"die\".\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJustin",
