Is the software guide an object that the player can interact with in the room using standard TA command (e.g. &quot;x guide&quot;, &quot;ask guide about XXX&quot;, etc)?

Saying &quot;change emotionally&quot; is all well and good, but what exactly that ends up meaning for you depends on your content. So... write it all out. Figure out what you mean by emotion in terms of the responses and then work out when you want the responses to occur. Basically, there is no &quot;simple&quot; way to do it. That was the magic of Galatea. (Unless you want to dig into the Galatea source and see how it was done and implement those methods.)\n\n[quote=&quot;Grids&quot;:30fit28n]5.
