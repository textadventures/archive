I wanted to start with a pseudo-customisation option screen for the players, where they can change their physical appearance. I've got no problem with sorting attributes out, but my real issue is this:\r\n\r\nThe player is prompted to choose attributes of themselves that they want to change (hair/eyes/skin/etc.). These are presented as links that appear on timers and take them to another page. The issue is, that when I click on one of the four available links, the others all remain and are still clickable. Whilst I want the one that I clicked to remain, I would rather that the other options disappear. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance! :)\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of the code:\r\n\r\n````JS.eval (\"setTimeout(function(){ASLEvent(\\\"link2\\\", \\\"Page3;black\\\")}, 2000);\")````\r\n\r\nAnd separately, the corresponding function to print the link.\r\n````\r\n<function name=\"link2\" parameters=\"stuff\"><![CDATA[\r\n    // parameter should be link;color\r\n    stuff = Split (stuff, \";\")\r\n    link = stuff[0]\r\n    color = stuff[1]\r\n    msg (\"{page:\"+link+\":{color:\"+color+\":<span style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;'><br>Hair.</span>}}\")\r\n  ]]></function>\r\n````\r\n\r\nI understand that the method of individually creating functions for links (as well as the whole mess with the text style) is unnecessary and clunky, but it works. I'm not looking for an alternative for this.",
