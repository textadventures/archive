I'm using the web version of quest, not the windows version, so the tutorial seems to be slightly different and I can't quite grasp it. I am attempting to give an item to a character in the game. I have gone to the character settings, activated the use/give, clicked on give (other object) to this, selected my object, and typed in the message I wanted to appear when giving the character the item, but nothing works. Ideally, I am trying to make it that you have to retrieve items for this character, and everytime you give him an item, a different message appears. Does anybody know how I would go about doing this?\n(Bonus question; how do object flags work?)",

      "EditableText": "Hmmm... I think it kind of depends on how the process of giving things to Sheriff Pepper goes.  If it is sequential, it is easier.  If the items you want to give can be given in any order, it gets a little trickier.\n\nLet's say you have items A, B, and C that you want to give Pepper.  If they must be given to him sequentially (A,B, then C), I would use flags.  I'd follow these steps.\n1.  On the give item A to pepper script, add a flag and call it one (or whatever).  My pic below is from my tutorial game.  Obviously you would replace Sheriff Pepper with my Frank =) and object one with whatever your object is.\n[attachment=0:1k6dp1fj]<!-- ia0 -->Screenshot (3).png<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:1k6dp1fj]\n2.  On the give item B to pepper script, Add an If - Pepper has flag name one, then print a message and add a flag and call it two AND unset flag one on pepper.  In the Else box add a print a message script and instruct the player that the item can't be given yet.  Evidently I can't add another screenshot to this post.  lol\n\n3.  On the give item C to pepper script, Add an If - Pepper has flag name two, then print a message and add a flag and call it complete AND unset flag two on pepper.  In the Else box add a print a message script and instruct the player that the item can't be given yet.\n\n4.  On your 'talk to; speak to' verb for pepper, add an If script.  If pepper has flag one, print a message.  Else if pepper has flag two, print a (different) message.  Else if (again) pepper has flag complete, print a (final) message.

If the items you want to give can be given in any order, it gets a little trickier.<br/><br/>Let's say you have items A, B, and C that you want to give Pepper.  If they must be given to him sequentially (A,B, then C), I would use flags.  I'd follow these steps.<br/>1.  On the give item A to pepper script, add a flag and call it one (or whatever).  My pic below is from my tutorial game.  Obviously you would replace Sheriff Pepper with my Frank =) and object one with whatever your object is.<br/><div><img src=\"/forumattachments/1287/Screenshot (3).png\" alt=\"Screenshot (3).png\" /></div><br/>2.  On the give item B to pepper script, Add an If - Pepper has flag name one, then print a message and add a flag and call it two AND unset flag one on pepper.  In the Else box add a print a message script and instruct the player that the item can't be given yet.  Evidently I can't add another screenshot to this post.  lol<br/><br/>3.  On the give item C to pepper script, Add an If - Pepper has flag name two, then print a message and add a flag and call it complete AND unset flag two on pepper.
