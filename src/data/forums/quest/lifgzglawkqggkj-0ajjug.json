      "EditableText": "Not sure on this one, but I think you might be looking for:\r\n```\r\nGrid_SetCentre(x, y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is relative to the player, or if you need to pass it the player's coordinates. If you need coords, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to find them, so it would probably end up being something like:\r\n```\r\nroom = game.pov.parent\r\nplayer_x = Grid_GetGridCoordinateForPlayer(game.pov, room, \"x\") + room.grid_width/2.0\r\nplayer_y = Grid_GetGridCoordinateForPlayer(game.pov, room, \"y\") + room.grid_height/2.0\r\nGrid_SetCentre(player_x, player_y)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I haven't checked this; it's possible SetCentre uses some weird coordinate system like pixels on the map rather than the system used for room coordinates, or something like that… but figure it might be worth trying)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might need to do something like:\r\n```\r\n      JS.ShowGrid (300)\r\n      Grid_SetScale (300)\r\n      Grid_Redraw\r\n      Grid_DrawPlayerInRoom (game.pov.parent)\r\n```\r\nThat's what the core library does at the start of the game if the grid is enabled. I'm not sure how much of that is necessary when changing the size of the grid later, but as they always appear together in the core code, it's possible that `ShowGrid` expects `Grid_SetScale` to be called after it to sort out centreing; or that SetScale expects to be followed by a `GridRedraw`.\r\n\r\nI'd probably try different combinations of the lines to see which ones behave as expected.",
