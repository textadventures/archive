It's one of the aliases for \"look at\".\r\nIn theory, there's nothing to stop you creating a new one, but the editor might tell you that your new command clashes with a built in one.\r\n\r\nYou can create a command by clicking on 'Commands' in the sidebar, and then clicking \"add\" to create a new one.\r\nYou'd want to give it the name `examine` and the pattern `examine #object#;ex #object#`.\r\n\r\nThen when the command is used, the variable `object` can be used to refer to the object being examined.\r\nI'd suspect that to examine an object you'd need to be close enough to touch it, and that if an object doesn't have a more detailed description, it should just show the standard \"look at\" description.\r\nSo the script for your command (iin code view) would look something like:\r\n```\r\nif (not ListContains (ScopeReachable(), object)) {\r\n  do (lookat, \"script\", QuickParams (\"object\", object))\r\n  msg (\"You can't get close enough to examine it more closely.\")\r\n}\r\nelse if (HasString (object, \"examine\")) {\r\n  msg (object.examine)\r\n}\r\nelse if (HasScript (object, \"examine\")) {\r\n  do (object, \"examine\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  do (lookat, \"script\", QuickParams (\"object\", object))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, for each object you can go to the Attributes tab and make an attribute named `examine`. It can either be a string, which will be displayed when the object is examined, or a script that will be run when it is examined.",
