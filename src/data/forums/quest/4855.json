I don't really have any code yet, but I'm looking for a way to have the player give commands to an NPC, which would then do the command.  Basically, have the NPC execute verbs like a player can.\n\nIs it even possible?",

Open ended discussion can only really lead to a situation not dissimilar to guess the verb unless handled brilliantly. Personally I'd do the same as I suggested on your notebook thread and have a discussion with a NPC start a minigame CYOA using the text processor where the player has choices of what they can say rather than making it open ended. If there was a better way of doing it then I'm sure Skyrim and GTA with their million pound budgets would have discovered it.",

It's not elegant, perhaps (lots of coding for various possibilities, and LOTS of individual new commands for various actions), but it reads more naturally.
