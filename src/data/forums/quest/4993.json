I've been over and over it and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. The order of events should go:\n\nIf the player is carrying object paper\nGive paper to dwarf\nPrint message\nAdd item seal of Abduco to inventory\n\nBut, it doesn't, and the game can't be finished without that object. Any help would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you. (Game is attached with walkthrough up to point where item should transfer to inventory).",
