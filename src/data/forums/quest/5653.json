I'm from Spain and this is not my native language.\nI'm starting with the latest version of Quest 5.6.2.\nI wonder if it is possible to choose the option to &quot;full screen&quot;, when I'm testing the game, and the interface occupies the entire screen and not center and with a lot of white space in the side.\nIn version 5.1 it was possible. Also I wonder if you might disappear, when testing the game, menus of &quot;inventary&quot;, &quot;Places and Objects&quot; and &quot;addresses&quot;. I would text game in the style of the original &quot;Adventure,&quot; &quot;The Hobbit&quot; etc.\nThank you very much in advance for the answer.",
