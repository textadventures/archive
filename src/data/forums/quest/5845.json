      "EditableText": "My issue: \n\nTimers on the web based version will cause the link pop-ups to disappear upon each tick of the timer.  If I click on an object link after entering a room, that popup on the link will disappear after 2 seconds.  I have to keep clicking it.  If I disable the Timers, the popups stay active after one click of the link.  \n\nThe timers I have keep random events continually calculating in the background, and occasionally spawn a creature, or they are to regenerate HP 1 point per 2 seconds, etc...   \n\nTimer is setup to start at the start of the game, and runs a script every 2 seconds.  \n\nIs there a reason why the link's popup will disappear only when timers are constantly ticking?  I am thinking maybe Quest counts a timer tick a turn, even though it's not printing anything on screen, other then a change in HP or spawning a object into the Places and Objects window pane.",
