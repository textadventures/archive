These verbs are displayed on the right hand side when your item is within your inventory to have it available at all. Besides that there is a checkbox \"adjust inventory verbs\" at the bottom of the wear tab. You probably don't want that checked for your helmet.",

Also another command is needed to bypass this type of interaction : \"WEAR ALL\" : You could produce a response:  \"suggest wearing things individually is a better option!\"",
