If you do File/Save while running the same game, it wants to save the game in progress instead, and if you happen to point it back to your original source, you overwrite that by mistake with something that isn't loadable by the editor. (At least, that's what I think happens.) If you open the game in a text editor, you'll see Quest actually knew the original game's name. It would be nice if it asked if you were really sure you wanted to overwrite the original with the saved game if it detects it's the same file.\n\nIt might be possible to extract the original game from the saved game (I hope).

This usually happens due to a confusion (in my opinion) in the desktop interface - if you're in the editor and hit Save, it saves your game that you're writing. If you do File/Save while running the same game, it wants to save the game in progress instead, and if you happen to point it back to your original source, you overwrite that by mistake with something that isn't loadable by the editor. (At least, that's what I think happens.) If you open the game in a text editor, you'll see Quest actually knew the original game's name. It would be nice if it asked if you were really sure you wanted to overwrite the original with the saved game if it detects it's the same file.<br/><br/>It might be possible to extract the original game from the saved game (I hope). I'll take a stab at it. Unless anyone else has any other ideas... <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
