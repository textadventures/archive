I'm trying to set my game (going to be multi) to save the location of player-x when they quitand have them start in the same room when they log in.  I've searched the forums for help but i have to admit i'm totally confused, not even sure where to start with the code.  I was trying to get it to work with &quot;roomid's&quot; persay, but not sure if i'm even doing that right.  I was hoping to get them going in that way so I could eventually put a goto command in the game and such...what i have for that is..\n\n[code:16vyt75f]define room &lt;1001&gt; \n                   alias &lt;randomname, townsquare&gt;\netc&#46;&#46;&#46;\n\n[/code:16vyt75f] \n\n\nany help on these issues would be greatly appreciated.  I've worked on other text based multi-player games, but always with in game builders, so the code is kind of new to me, still trying to figure it out so lamens terms, if at all possible would be appreciated too  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->  <!-- s:oops: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarrassed\" /><!-- s:oops: --> \n\nthanks in advance",
