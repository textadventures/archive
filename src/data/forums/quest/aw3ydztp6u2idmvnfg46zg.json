But I'm a bit flummoxed by like, basic options.\r\n\r\nAt present, when a player enters a room, the game presents information in this order:\r\n\r\n- prefix for entering the room\r\n- 'prefix for seeing objects' object, object, and object\r\n- 'prefix for potential travel directions' direction, direction, or direction.\r\n- basic description of room\r\n\r\nI....do not like this, and am really not sure how to modify it. I want it to ideally go\r\n- prefix for entering room (configurable based on game events, i.e running if being chased, sneaking if not)\r\n- basic description of the room\r\n- And then I want further first-time description explaining what the player sees re: visible doors, objects, and so on. (e.g. 'At the end of the hallway is a stairwell', where 'stairwell' is an exit) \r\n\r\nI also don't want the game to announce most objects; I'd prefer the player have to look around to see anything that's not right in front of their face. Seems more immersive that way. I've been messing around with the main room, object, and exit options, and can't seem to figure out how to change how the game presents this text.\r\n\r\nAny tips? So far all I can do is change the prefixes (e.g. 'you see' an object), when what I really want to be doing is saying something like 'to your right you see an overburdened coat hanger. At its base is a pair of dusty boots' with the coat hanger and the boots being objects. Maybe it would be best to just prevent the game from reporting objects and exits to the player at all, and have it all be in description?",
