(For example, some games with that effect allow you to press a key or button to bypass the text since after a while it gets very tedious for the text to appear at a rate slower than normal reading.) It's up to you how you want to create your game, but as a player, I doubt I'd be able to get through a game that used typewriter throughout the game. Life's just too short to sit around waiting for text to appear.\r\n\r\n",
