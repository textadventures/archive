Just a bit of game code that can be easily included in (or sort of 'pasted into') any game.)\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn fact, I like Quest better than Inform 7 or Tads, even when we're talking about desktop editors.\r\n\r\nInform 7 is a very close runner-up, but Quest is just easier to use and you can do more with it, especially with graphics and such.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIs *editing*  online what you're after?  Or do you just want the game to be playable online?  If it's the latter, you can upload your Quest games you create offline to the site, and they can be played online.

You could enter the functions you need one by one online.</p>\n<p>Some things are harder to pull off online, and I don't think you can use types at all, but you can still make it work.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If there's a better online editor to create text adventures, I haven't found it.</p>\n<p>Playfic.com hosts an older version of the Inform 7 editor, but they have the same problem: no extensions can be added.  (An Inform extension is the equivalent of a Quest library.  Just a bit of game code that can be easily included in (or sort of 'pasted into') any game.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In fact, I like Quest better than Inform 7 or Tads, even when we're talking about desktop editors.</p>\n<p>Inform 7 is a very close runner-up, but Quest is just easier to use and you can do more with it, especially with graphics and such.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Is <em>editing</em>  online what you're after?  Or do you just want the game to be playable online?  If it's the latter, you can upload your Quest games you create offline to the site, and they can be played online.  (You probably read that already.  I was just throwing it out there, just in case.)</p>\n\n",
