      "EditableText": "So, in my game, I've got two place where the player needs to type something in to access the next part of the game. Once with a keycode, and once with a text password. I used \"Get input\" and \"Switch\" Scripts to make both of these.\r\n\r\nFirst script: \r\n```\r\nswitch (result) {\r\n  case (3242) {\r\n    msg (\"The screen flashes green and the door unlocks with a click.\")\r\n    UnlockExit (BackDoor)\r\n  }\r\n  default {\r\n    msg (\"The buttons flash red and the keypad buzzes. Your code is incorrect.\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond script: \r\n```\r\nmsg (\"Password:<br/><br/>Hint: You are standing in a room with an all southern view. Suddenly a bear walks by the window. What color is the bear?\")\r\nget input {\r\n  switch (result) {\r\n    case (red) {\r\n      msg (\"That's an absurd answer.\")\r\n    }\r\n    case (white) {\r\n      ClearScreen\r\n      msg (\"Congrats you did it!\")\r\n    }\r\n    default {\r\n      msg (\"Incorrect.\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I've used \"result\" for both of these, which results in the only correct answer for the second script being the correct one for the first: the number 3242.  But when I try to use another variable: \"text\" or \"code\" or something, it doesn't work. I don't know how to fix this, and I can't find an example in the documentation.",
