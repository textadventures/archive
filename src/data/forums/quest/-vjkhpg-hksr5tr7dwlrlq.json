      "EditableText": "> do (cauldron, \"take\") does not work. I do not know why not.\r\n\r\nBecause `take` is a command, not a verb.\r\n\r\n(verbs are a special type of command, which just check if the object has a script attribute with the same name as the verb and runs that script)\r\n\r\n> to lead to a \"list\" of objects.\r\n\r\nAh yes… `take` and `drop` behave a little differently, because they can take multiple arguments. For example, the player can type \"take bell, book, candle\" or \"drop all\". Because it's always running the code that knows how to parse a list of objects, the argument is a list even if it's a list with one item in it.\r\n\r\n> I know I can just tap \"add to inventory,\r\n\r\nThe big difference here is that the \"take\" command does a lot more than adding an item to the inventory. It checks if there are limits on the number or weight of items a player can carry, and whether the object is reachable (not in a locked container, for example). It then checks the object's take behaviour (can take, can't take, or run script) and acts as appropriate; and if the object was taken, prints a message to say that the object was taken. `AddToInventory` just moves an object to the player's inventory without any checks or messages.\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, the `take` command just loops over the list of objects it's been given and calls a function which does all this other stuff. So if you want to make sure that a script doesn't automatically give the player an object that's too heavy for them to carry, or similar, you would want to use the same function:\r\n```\r\nDoTake (cauldron, false)\r\n```\r\n(the second argument determines whether it will print \"It's too heavy.\" or \"Cauldron: It's too heavy.\" if there is some reason it fails. Generally, the take command only repeats the item name before errors if the player was trying to take more than one thing)",
