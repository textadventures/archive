Now this could only be an increase in your code of, say, 15... but when multiplied out it get's into LARGE differences.\nstr=40\n&quot;you hit for 10,000&quot;\nstr=41\n&quot;you hit for 25,000&quot;\n\nI did have a nice formula worked out, and with a nice curve IIRC.\n\nMy reasoning was, make it a tiny bit large, and then bring it down, instead of keeping it small and making it large - you get me?\nPlus the fact Quest doesn't catch the error - instead it crashes <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> (again - from memory).\n\n[quote:gyt5o3wi]Eh, if you used any arrays, they would immediately be broken[/quote:gyt5o3wi]\nWhy?\nUnless you're storing arrays to keep monster values/player values.... Which is silly.\nKeep player values in a &quot;stats&quot; object.. I'm not sure if there's a game[playerid] object - but you can use that too...\n\nTo begin battle may need a little alteration - cloning the battle room or finding an available/free battle room..\nI didn't know about Quest crashing on array usage though..\n\nIt's alot easier to write generic scripts for objects - that's why a better script, using functions, can be basically ported over, with a little change here and there... (temporary variables are one of the changes) Of course, I've ignored my own advice, and done it in halfs...\n\n[quote:gyt5o3wi]Point taken though, we both just know it isn't that easy typically[/quote:gyt5o3wi] Yeah.. It needs damn good foresight to plan it all properly to be ported [i:gyt5o3wi]easily[/i:gyt5o3wi]...

Instead of &quot;You hit for 13 points of damage&quot;, what you might read instead is &quot;You lunge forward, pressing the advantage, and slash Horatio across his chest.  His leather armor parts like cheese.  Blood spurts across your vision.  He stumbles backwards, stunned.&quot;\n\nThat description implies other systematics as well:  armor condition, combat advantage, a lunging maneuver, being stunned.  It means that things such as blood must be accounted for - knowing what it splashes on, how much off it, how long ago, whether it has dried, etc.  Okay, the blood thing is FAR down the list on the development schedule, but I'd like to have it.\n\nIn any case, whether hit points or wounds, the ability to scale the chosen system to operate beneath a 32,000-odd integer limit is definately do-able and enjoyable.",

The one in Faeguard is modelled after <a href=\"http&#58;//www&#46;theriddleofsteel&#46;net/whatis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Riddle of Steel</a>.  Essentially all living objects have body parts which sustain wounds of various intensities.  Those wounds apply penalties to performance based on their intensity (level), number, and location.  <br/><br/>Adopting this system has a great benefit to text games:  it provides a built-in method of description generation.  Instead of &quot;You hit for 13 points of damage&quot;, what you might read instead is &quot;You lunge forward, pressing the advantage, and slash Horatio across his chest.  His leather armor parts like cheese.  Blood spurts across your vision.  He stumbles backwards, stunned.&quot;<br/><br/>That description implies other systematics as well:  armor condition, combat advantage, a lunging maneuver, being stunned.  It means that things such as blood must be accounted for - knowing what it splashes on, how much off it, how long ago, whether it has dried, etc.  Okay, the blood thing is FAR down the list on the development schedule, but I'd like to have it.<br/><br/>In any case, whether hit points or wounds, the ability to scale the chosen system to operate beneath a 32,000-odd integer limit is definately do-able and enjoyable.",
