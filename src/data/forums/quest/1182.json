      "EditableText": "Here's a list of some stuff I'd like to see in future versions of Quest/QDK:\n\n* Some sort of &quot;Container&quot; setting for objects to make it easy to implement a container you can put things in. Further to this, it would be cool to be able to set object's sizes and/or weights to limit what you can carry and put in containers.\n\n* A system where you can run a text entry window. So you could set up a scenario where the player types &quot;Enter password&quot; and it brings up a window where they can type in the password. The entry can check the text for what is entered, and if it matches the password, the door will open (or whatever), otherwise print a failed message. Or even just get the player to enter their name.\n\n* Some sort of turn-based system, whereby each entry typed is a &quot;turn&quot;. Then you could set things to happen after a certain number of turns, or Every (x) turns, and last for (x) number of turns.

Further to this, it would be cool to be able to set object's sizes and/or weights to limit what you can carry and put in containers.<br/><br/>* A system where you can run a text entry window. So you could set up a scenario where the player types &quot;Enter password&quot; and it brings up a window where they can type in the password. The entry can check the text for what is entered, and if it matches the password, the door will open (or whatever), otherwise print a failed message.
