Other players that will follow the player from room to room and be able to ask questions of, or engage in dialogue with.\n\nFinally, I want to know if it's possible to create a screen above the actual text interface below that won't paste itself into the actual text, but rather as a static screen... like a background that will stay above the text and never move unless traded with a new picture.\n\nAny assistance would be much appreciated ^_^",
