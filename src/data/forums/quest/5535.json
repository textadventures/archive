      "EditableText": "Instead of using the 'hole' as an exit, I would make the 'hole' an object.  That way you know it can be made visible and is easier to deal with.  Exits are a little wonky unless you are using them to... well, exit a room.  Just make OBJECT hole visible.\n\nWhen it comes time to use the 'hole' as an exit, I'd add a verb to the 'hole' object.  I think you could add 'use' or 'enter' as your verb.  Then, in the script box for that verb, simply use a 'move player to [new room]'.  It might make your map goofy if you are using one though.\n\nIn that case, if you have or want the exit to be tied to a direction, I would still use the 'hole' as an object.   When the player looks at hole you could print a message like &quot;If you were as small as a mouse, you might be able to go down through the small tunnel.&quot;  Start with that exit locked.  When the player is as small as a mouse, unlock the exit (and make it visible if needed).  If the player grows again, just lock the exit back.  You will need to name the exit to do this.\n\nThat make sense?  Let me know.  Good luck.\n\nXanMag",
