What I did (with Quest 5.7.2 still installed) was open up my \"Program Files\" directory; then I right-clicked on the \"Quest 5\" folder and copied it; then pasted to the Desktop; then renamed the newly created directory on my Desktop to \"Quest 572\";  and then I updated to Quest 5.8.\r\n\r\nNow, I can run Quest.exe from the \"Quest 572\" directory on my desktop to work on my old game-in-progress in Quest 5.7.2, or I can just open Quest normally (from the Start Menu or by double-clicking a ```.quest``` or ```.aslx``` file) to run Quest 5.8.\r\n\r\n---\r\nALSO NOTE:\r\n\r\nIf you open an ```.aslx``` file with asl version 550 in the editor with Quest 5.8, the first time Quest saves the game from the GUI interface it will change the asl version to 580.
