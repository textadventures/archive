I’ve done all the scripting for the ‘yes’ part as it’s simple- you just continue with the game. The ‘no’ part is what gets me. Is there a way so, when you click ‘no’, the menu will pop up again, and then when you click on another answer it will come up with the ‘are you sure’ until ‘yes’ is clicked?\r\nFor the menu, I am using the ‘if object attribute equals player attribute...’ way.",
