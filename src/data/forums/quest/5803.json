So i just started toying around with Quest as i've been wanting to write an IF and i'm running through some things in my head, combat, equipment, yada yada yada, but the big thing that i need to be able to do is pull up a random room, or description, or something for a type of &quot;explore&quot; kind of thing, different places when you do it will give you different &quot;scenes&quot; and a possible chance to find loot, enemies, other areas, that kind of stuff. I'm sure it is possible to do, i'm just not figuring it out.",
