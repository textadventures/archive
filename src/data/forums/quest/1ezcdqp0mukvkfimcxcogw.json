It scrolls to the bottom, then bounces back up a bit, then scrolls back to the bottom, then back up a bit (but less than before), and repeats. I think it's just because so much text is flying at the screen that it is too much for the scroll to handle.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to adjust the scroll speed to be faster so this is less of an issue? My room descriptions are pretty short and simple, but if there isn't a way to increase scroll speed, I will probably just have to cut down on the room description layout.\r\n\r\nAny code and/or suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nRandom additional question: Is there a way to not have Quest auto-populate \"A\" or \"An\" before every room name?",
