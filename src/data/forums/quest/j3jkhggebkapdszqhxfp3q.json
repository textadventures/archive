Naturally, players would have to say \"Ask Derendil about fungi Derendil\" since you need to specify who you are asking the question to, and the verbs don't pick up that it already said \"Derendil\" in the middle of the sentence. I tried making a verb called \"ask\", and it told me the verb would clash with the ask, and that I could use the ask/tell tab to help me. However, there is no Ask/Tell tab that I can see... Just setup, object, inventory, verbs, features, and objects... Please help!",
