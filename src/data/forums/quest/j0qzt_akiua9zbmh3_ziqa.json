On your own computer, you can have a file that stays in memory somewhere until you save it to disk. But online, it's just as likely that every single click you make has the server load the file, make a tiny change, and save it again. Same for Google Docs (though that does include the change history in the saved file, so you have an \"undo\" button).",
