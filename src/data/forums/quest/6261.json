In the &quot;Object Inventory&quot; the second find of the clothing item was stated as &quot;worn&quot; and when they put the object on again, it double the stats that it's supposed to give. How I generally do things in my game is I create a list like &quot;Equipment&quot; for example, and build items there in the list and then set up scripts that moves those items into the game. \n\nI was wondering if there is a better way of doing this like for example cloning the main objects leaving those objects in the &quot;Equipment&quot; section and sending their clones into the game for the player to find? I'm not sure what I should do to solve this problem. \n\nAny advice?",
