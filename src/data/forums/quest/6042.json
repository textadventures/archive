I tried several things and now have two climb; climb ups and a climb on the verbs list . I cannot delete any of them. Deleting hanging rope and re entering it does not work. I seem to have messed up ' climb ' and can't get out of it. I now have a rope integral to the game that no one can climb. I don't do coding . Can anyone give me a simple answer please.",

Next, make sure 'Verbs' has been expanded.\n\nAll verbs you make will appear in this list. Find the ones you wish to remove/alter, and do so from there.\n\nAlso, I would highly recommend creating a backup or two. What I do is save my current project, then save as 'x BU1', 'x BU2', wherein x is the name of the project. Keeping backups is also very handy for when something breaks, as it allows you to compare to previous versions if it works there.",
