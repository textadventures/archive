      "EditableText": "So, I recently downloaded Quest, and I'm trying out the Gamebook function, because it seems easier than building a text adventure at this point. This Gamebook is already at 50+ pages long, and I don't want people who play it to have to go through the exact same choices they did before to get through this game should it crash/they close it, so I'm wondering: is there any way to save the game in Gamebook?",
