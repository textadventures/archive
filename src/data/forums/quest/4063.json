However ....I came here and the easy solution was to click the attributes tab.\n\nThere is no attributes tab for objects on the web version (Only  Set up, object, inventory, use/give, verbs, container, options, ask/tell, objects)\n\nI'm really far into the game, and hate to start over to download the app, don't know why I didn't.\n\nAnyhow, is there any way on the web program to subtract bullets when the gun is used? I have figured out the use on, thing.\n\nTHANKS SO MUCH\n\nEDIT - I am currently downloading the app and the game to see if I can make it work, but still lost on attributes.",
