If so, that's not possible.\n\nYou could print a line of dashes like that on the screen, but it's not really splitting anything because the text will continue to scroll upwards of the screen whenever stuff gets typed in like it currently does. I suppose you could try to fake it by writing a function that constantly clears the screen and redraws it with the line, but I don't think it would work very well and it's a lot of work for something that likely still won't do what you're looking for.",
