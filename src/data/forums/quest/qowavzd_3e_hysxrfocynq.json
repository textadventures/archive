The `alias` attribute is the one that will appear in room descriptions and similar, and the `alt` attribute is a stringlist of alternate names. In this case, I would suggest setting the alias to `unconscious guard` and putting `guard` in the alternate list (which I think is on the \"Object\" tab in the editor – though that's just from memory). Then, when the player finds out his name, you can change the alias to `Stanley`.\r\n\r\nThen, because \"guard\" is still in the alternate list, \"ask guard about fish fingers\" should work normally.\r\n\r\nI hope that's helpful; part of your question seems to be cut off, so I'm guessing what you were having trouble with.",
