Gave it an attribute of \"Full,\" and set it to \"True.\" Went to \"Setup\" page and description changed \"Text\" to \"Script.\" Below that, it says \"Print\" and next to that a  little gray box says \"Message\" with a down arrow. So in the box I typed \"\"Waste Basket is \" + Full + \".\"\r\n\r\nAs I understood the Eggs example, that should say \"Waste Basket is full\" when User looks at it.

      "EditableText": "You have the line:\r\n```\r\n          MoveObject (key, waste basket)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have two expressions in there, technically. One is `key`, the other is `waste basket`.\r\n\r\nWhen an expression is a bare word like that, Quest does 3 things:\r\n1. If the object is the name of a local variable, it uses that variable.\r\n2. If it's not a local variable, but is the `name` of an object, it uses that object.\r\n3. If it's neither of those, cause an error.\r\n\r\nObviously, putting the name of an object in your code will result in it always doing the thing to the same object, so '2' is no good for you, and you don't want an error. So part '1' of that process will help.\r\n\r\nYou need a local variable - which can hold any type of data, but right now you need one that's an object.\r\n\r\nThe local variables available within and `addscript` are (in addition to any you created):\r\n* `object` - the object that is being put in something\r\n* `destination` - the object it's being put into\r\n* `this` - the object that 'owns' the script. You can normally identify `this` in the editor by looking which object you are currently editing\r\n\r\nUsing these variables is usually a good idea.\r\nSo you would want something like:\r\n```\r\n          MoveObject (object, destination)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n          MoveObject (object, this)\r\n```\r\nYou can use whichever is easier for you to understand :)\r\n\r\nNow, technically you could also do:\r\n```\r\n          MoveObject (object, waste basket)\r\n```\r\nbut that's a bad habit to get into.\r\n\r\nMaybe at some point in the future, another room will need a waste basket. So you might want to copy and paste the object, and put it in another room.\r\nIf you do that, you will need to go through all the copy's scripts, changing everywhere it says `waste basket` to `waste basket2`. This can be time consuming once you make more complex objects, and leaves little insidious bugs that are hard to track down if you miss one.\r\n\r\nUsing `this` instead of the object's name in your script means that a script will always refer to the right object; so you don't need to worry about it anymore. Stuff won't break if you clone the object, copy and paste it in the editor, or just change its name. So it's a good habit to get into.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nTangentially relevant: a common mistake people make is not using `destination` in drop scripts.\r\nAn object can have a script that runs when it is dropped. One common use for this is objects that are automatically switched off when they are dropped. Like a torch; someone might try:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"The torch goes out as you drop it!\")\r\nSetObjectFlagOff (this, \"lit\")\r\nMoveObject (this, game.pov.parent)\r\n```\r\nBut you might not realise that commands like \"put torch in cupboard\" will also run the drop script (unless the cupboard has an addscript). So that script should be:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"The torch goes out as you drop it!\")\r\nSetObjectFlagOff (this, \"lit\")\r\nMoveObject (this, destination)\r\n```\r\nto ensure that putting the object into a container works properly. And also that rooms like the tightrope in my Circus game work properly. (objects dropped on the tightrope go to the ring below)\r\n\r\nAnd on that subject, if you want your script to keep working as you do more complex things with it, it might be worth changing:\r\n```\r\n          MoveObject (object, destination)\r\n```\r\nto something like:\r\n```\r\n          if (HasScript (object, \"drop\")) {\r\n            do  (object, \"drop\", QuickParams (\"object\", object, \"destination\", destination))\r\n          }\r\n          else {\r\n            MoveObject (key, waste basket)\r\n          }\r\n```\r\nso that if the object you're putting into the waste basket has a \"when dropped\" script, it will run that script rather than just moving it.",

      "HTML": "<p>Thanks Mr. Angel. Now is there a way to use a local variable if you don't know to which object the variable will be referring?? I want to be able to empty the waste basket of whatever object happens to be in it.</p>\n<p>Here is the code for waste basket. It's same as I posted in previous post except for a few lines at the end.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;object name=\"waste basket\"&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=\"editor_object\" /&gt;\n  &lt;inherit name=\"container_open\" /&gt;\n  &lt;take /&gt;\n  &lt;alt type=\"stringlist\"&gt;\n    &lt;value&gt;wb&lt;/value&gt;\n  &lt;/alt&gt;\n  &lt;feature_container /&gt;\n  &lt;close type=\"boolean\"&gt;false&lt;/close&gt;\n  &lt;listchildren /&gt;\n  &lt;open type=\"boolean\"&gt;false&lt;/open&gt;\n  &lt;transparent type=\"boolean\"&gt;false&lt;/transparent&gt;\n  &lt;not_all /&gt;\n  &lt;look type=\"script\"&gt;\n    if (GetBoolean(waste basket, \"full\")) {\n      msg (\"The waste basket is overflowing with putrid offal and trash.\")\n    }\n    else {\n      msg (\"A normal, plastic waste basket, eighteen (or so) inches tall. It is currently empty.\")\n    }\n  &lt;/look&gt;\n  &lt;ontake type=\"script\"&gt;\n    msg (\"You are now holding the waste basket. Big whoop.\")\n  &lt;/ontake&gt;\n  &lt;addscript type=\"script\"&gt;\n    if (GetBoolean(waste basket, \"full\")) {\n      msg (\"The waste basket is full. You cannot possibly stuff anything else into it.\")\n    }\n    else {\n      msg (\"OK, you put the \" + GetDisplayAlias (object) + \" into the waste basket.\")\n      SetObjectFlagOn (waste basket, \"full\")\n      MoveObject (object, this)\n    }\n  &lt;/addscript&gt;\n  &lt;empty type=\"script\"&gt;\n    if (GetBoolean(waste basket, \"full\")) {\n      msg (\"You empty the waste basket\")\n      SetObjectFlagOff (waste basket, \"full\")\n      RemoveObject (waste basket.child)\n    }\n    else {\n      msg (\"The waste basket is already empty.\")\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you see , I refer to contents of waste basket as \"waste.basket child.\" From that fact that the code doesn't work and gives me and error message, I have deduced that's not the way to do it. If I just empty the waste basket, the item is still in it.</p>\n<p>Here is the error I get:<br>\n\"You empty the waste basket<br>\nError running script: Error compiling expression 'object': RootExpressionElement: Cannot convert type 'Object' to expression result of 'Element'\"</p>\n<p>Sometimes, with your help, Mr. Angel, I think I'm just on the verge of understanding Quest. Of being able to do simple things, like emptying a waste basket. Then I get an error message like that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>RootExpressionElement: Cannot convert type 'Object' to expression result of 'Element'\" &lt;&lt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I mean, seriously, that makes absolutely no sense. Might as well be written in Martian. To me, it's pretty much what you'd expect if a cat walked on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Excuse me. I'm frustrated at my lack of progress and I'm sure you're frustrated at having to explain each tiny little step.</p>\n\n",
