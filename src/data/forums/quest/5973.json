If you do not want the object to be buyable again (which I suspect you wouldn't), use a 'remove object script' to remove that object from the game.\n\nNow... if you want a more complex system where you are using a certain number of coins to buy a range of different things, then I can help with that too, but it will require setting up attributes - which gets a little trickier and will require me to be sitting in front of my home computer.\n\nI will add a 'vendor/merchant' to my tutorial now though, because I think it is a good idea.\n\nRemember, this is a basic outline.
