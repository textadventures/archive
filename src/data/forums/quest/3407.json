I created the rest of the house, basically, with a few things you can do that are not important to the plot, just to keep it from being completly boring. I am trying to think of things or puzzles for each room, either mini-puzzles for bonus points or a way to make it tie into the plot. Am I wasting time doing this? I feel like it would be weird for a player to go from their bedroom to outside or another location with nothing in between. What is your opinions?\n\nAlso, Where can I get ideas for naming the game? I am terrible at coming up with a name that pulls players in.",

I am creating the game play by a mixture of story, clues on the real murderer, puzzles on how the real murderer made you look suspicious which you will then have to disprove the evidence, earning points by successfully choosing an item, doing an interaction, and even gain score with some funny actions. Then I am filling in some spots with mini-puzzles that won't stop you from being able to win, but are fairly entertaining anyway. \n\nI hope hope hope this game is a success. I got the idea from another (non text adventure) game, and altered it to be my own idea (so im not just copying some other game) and i m adding the stuff in MY game that i felt was missing or didnt liek about the game that inspired me.\n\n\nlast but not least..i can't believe king's quest V was turned into an adventure. I am SO going to play that today while i take a break from uilding my game, king's quest V was one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE games! ty!",
