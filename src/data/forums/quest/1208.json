      "EditableText": "Someone told me that it was possible in the current version of Quest to code in riding animals and being carried by other characters.\n\nWhat I want to do is make it so that I can ride a pony, or be carried by someone else on the back of their pony, or be carried by someone who is riding a pony. Also, I want to be able to carry someone while I am riding a pony or have someone ride on the back of my pony.\n\nWill Quest let me have all of this going on? It would also be fun if other characters could, at random, get on ponies and ride off on them, things like that. But I don't want most of the ponies to be &quot;characters&quot; as such, I want them to be just controllable animals. One or possibly two of the ponies will be able to talk and be a character, but I also want it to be ridable like the others, because the player isn't supposed to find out that the pony can talk until later in the adventure.\n\nI hope this makes sense!",

In the game properties for â€œafter each turnâ€, have an IF statement that puts the pony in the room with you if the flag riding_pony is set.\nYou might even want to have to pony objects.

You could make the story more realistic if you include different room descriptions when you enter or leave on a pony; such as:\n\n1.

(leaving a room) The pony bucks and tosses you into the field (then have field desc show)\n3. (between rooms) Clear the window and print an imaginative narration, such as a journey the pony takes you on, maybe giving you an object on the way?  How about throwing in some music?\n\nHow about a list of commands to give the horse?\n\nAs far as the code goes, I'm working on something similar, but have been investing my time into completing my webpage, so haven't had time to delve into it further.\n\nKeep me posted on tricks you come up with, like timing intervals and such that work.\n\n-W.
