I downloaded a DSS file on the internet (for my job's need) and i want to import it to my own websites. However, it could not be played on my Windows Media Playyer player and I do not know why. I downloaded this audio converter as you can see (http://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/convert-dss-to-mp3.html) to convert DSS to MP3 for a better compatibility with my player. However, just before the converting process, it required me to preset some parameters, i know i should choose MP3 as the output. But how about the bit rate and sample rate? What do these 2 parameters mean? I have no ideas because it is my first time to convert media files. What on earth should i do?",
