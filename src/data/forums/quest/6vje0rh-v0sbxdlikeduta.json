      "EditableText": "Hi everyone! I'm working on a game that requires a car. There are three locations the player can drive between: `mayfair_street`, `soho_street` and `st_james_park`. \r\n\r\nAt one point in the game, the player will be asked to drive from the park to Soho, and they'll think they're using the exit they've always used, but they'll actually be taken into a maze that has magically been placed between them and their destination. Once the maze is completed, it disappears and the player can move between the three driveable rooms as before. I have the triggering event and the invisible/visible exits issue logic worked out already. (Proud of myself!)\r\n\r\nI've written some pseudocode for a `drive` verb on the car that I believe handles basic navigation between the three driveable locations, and I think it also handles entrance to the maze. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/beefoundry/66e51ace120c4d204f49014634cf0ba0\">Here's the gist with the pseudocode.</a> Once I've figured out how to make the game check which room it's in, I think I can make that work.\r\n\r\nMy issue is what happens once the player is in the maze. I'll want to move the car and the player (and their friend, who is attached to the player as a follower), from room to room all at once. There are 24 rooms in the maze, and some rooms have up to six exits. Obviously, what I've done in the pseudocode isn't sustainable at this scale. \r\n\r\nI'm sure it's clear to you by now that there are commands or functions I could be using that do all this better. What I have is cobbled together from advice to others in old forum posts.
