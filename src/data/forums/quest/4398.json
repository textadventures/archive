And whilst the player can still interact. And after the sound is done, the player should be moved to the next room. It worked fine before, but I continued working on the game and now the player only gets moved when it types in something.\nAny ideas what's wrong?\nI attached the game file. If you need the sound files, tell me and I'll load them up seperately, they're too big to load up now.\nthe rooms are from r4despair to r5donecrying and from r5donecrying to end.",
