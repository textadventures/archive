I just want to figure out if we can use the function as I already mentioned.\n\nFor example, say you found the box (a container), which was sealed in masking tape. So, in order to open it, you must have some kind of knife in your inventory. And then, use the command 'Cut [b:2xh2a15w]box[/b:2xh2a15w] with [b:2xh2a15w]knife[/b:2xh2a15w]'. Even I just found out using the lock function within container function is not so effective for this one. Another example also can be 'Open [b:2xh2a15w]bottle[/b:2xh2a15w] with [b:2xh2a15w]bottle opener[/b:2xh2a15w]'.\n\nAny ideas?",
