      "EditableText": "If you have a really large .ASL file and want to make it more readable by breaking it down into smaller \"include\" files (i.e. library files I guess), do you have to put the \"!addto game\" block for each room or can you do one \"!addto game\" and one \"!end\" and between those tags list a bunch of rooms? \n\nI guess mainly why I want to do this is sometimes I'll get a compiler error where the .ASL file won't load at all and especially if I haven't worked on the code in awhile I have no idea where in the code the error is coming from, so if maybe I had smaller files I could figure out what file was most recently modified and therefor have a better idea where in the code the error was coming from. What's happening is sometimes the QDK seems to take long lines of code and split them in half and then I get an error message like this: \n[i:33q3evti]\nFATAL ERROR: Expected closing ) character in ...[/i:33q3evti]\n\nI usually can find it in a text editor by using a search string but a line number also would be helpful to display with the above error.",

Have a separate folder for each game you make, then have a central ASL file, which links to separate files, one each for things like menus, procedures, text blocks, rooms and objects, etc.  By breaking it down like this, it will be easier to spot errors.  What we also need is a built-in text editor in QDK.  This would help heaps in this sort of situation.  And just off the topic a bit: A select case statement in ASL would do wonders, especially for games like the Millionaire one I'm making.",
