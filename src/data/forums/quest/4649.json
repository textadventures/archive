I am making a hacking game and I want to change what the game says when it doesn't recognize the entered command.\nFor example: If you type igfujg into the command bar (or any other text that has no attached command) the game will return &quot;I don't understand your command&quot;\nI would instead like this to say:\n[Error]: Command unrecognized.\n[Error]: Unable to execute command.\nThis would make it feel more like a computer that a quest game.\n\nI have been helped on this forum before on how to enter periods into #text# and I was taught about the Library Elements, basically Quest's code and how it runs. I figure the return variable is in here somewhere and I can just change what it prints, but I'm not sure where it is. I've looked around but the closest thing i can find to it is one called &quot;unresolvedcommand&quot;, which doesn't seem to contain what I need. Hope you guys can help, but I'm in no rush. It's not stopping my coding and can be added in at anytime. Thanks in advance!",
