      "EditableText": "I was wondering if you guys have ever thought of making a tutorial where there is a full game completed, but you are allowed to mess with the code it self?  I ask this because as some one has pointed out and from personal experience, I learn better (And so too maybe others as well.) when you can mess with the working code and recreate it to your liking.  I have tried RPG Maker XP (I think that was the one, it was freeware.) and it had a tutorial as well.  I did not get too far into it, but it had the option to actually see what was done with the game to make it work the way it worked.  I had my own NPCs walking and talking, different maps attached and so on and so forth.  Granted, that game was a little more linear in what you could do, but the point was I could see a for instance and I could see how the finished product looked.\n\n  I know you have a wiki and a tutorial and I know we can ask questions and no doubt I will still be asking them, but I think if there was a game we could look at in full code that would be better.  I am assuming there is a lock out from seeing the code in completed games, that way others can not just go to any game and mess with it.  But is there a way to make a special game able to be opened up or some one nice enough to open up their own game and just copy and paste the entire code into a post and then we can copy it into word pad and look at it while we play the game and get a feel for it.  Obviously a game they themselves used for testing or one made specifically for this task.  Nothing fancy with story, we just need to see the way it works.",

I have  tried and played 20-30 different games from 5 stars to not even rated yet and although I have not gotten far into the games themselves usually to know what will happen at the very end, they are mostly just you by yourself roaming a map and interacting with inanimate objects.  I am looking for something with a lot of NPC interactions; like roaming and a lot of talking back and forth, and time flow in the game and to have certain objects met in order for the map to change or the mood of the game change entirely.\n\n  Thankfully someone was kind enough to share a work in progress for roaming NPCs and another for time flow, but now I just need to find out about the rest.  And when I say I want certain objects met, I do not mean simply to magically open a door for the player to continue, but more impact on the game it self.  I hate asking all these questions, it feels like you guys are actually making the game more than I am, but once I know how to do it I wont have to ask so much any more.   <!-- s:( --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /><!-- s:( -->",
