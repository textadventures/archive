      "EditableText": "Ugh.  Sorry.  I went off of memory and that definitely wasn't very clear.\r\n\r\nI have always hated the way quest handles containers and found that I was better off just creating my own, but... here is what I just did and it seems to work fine.\r\n\r\n1.  Create cabinet.\r\n2.  Under the \"look at\" description on the setup tab, I chose to \"Run script\".  \r\n3.  Select an 'If' script and choose 'if object has flag', select cabinet and type in <i>isopen</i> in the flag name box.\r\n4.  Choose to print message in the 'Then' dropdown.  Print your message.  I chose this: \"It's an open cabinet.\"\r\n5.  In the 'Else If' box, choose 'if object does not have flag' (or I suppose you could put this in the 'Else' box...), cabinet, isopen\r\n6.  Choose print message in the 'Then' dropdown just below the Else If.  I chose this: \"Scrawled across its surface is the word <i>Alohomora</i>.\r\n\r\nIt is closed with no apparent way to open it.\"\r\n\r\n7.  Go to the Features tab of the cabinet.  Here is where I cannot stand the way Quest handles containers.  But, whatever, I'm probably using them wrong.\r\n8.  Under container type, I chose 'closed container'.  I'm not even sure why based on the other options, but after fiddling with it, it seemed to work the best.\r\n9.  I left can be open and can be closed ticked.\r\n10.  I typed in the message to print when trying to open and close containers the following:  \r\n\"Apparently you need a magic word to open the cabinet...\"  and\r\n\"No need to close it.\"\r\n\r\n11.  Also, I did not use a verb, although I am sure that would have worked to.  I added a command to the room that had a cabinet in it and type the following in the box just below 'Command pattern'\r\n<i>say alohomora; yell alohomora; cast alohomora; alohomora</i>\r\n^this will take care of anything that matches the above input.  The downside is, it has to <b>directly</b> match.  You can't misspell or abbreviate alohomora. There are lots of ways to handle this situation.  Commands, verbs, clickable verb 'say' or 'cast' under an object called alohomora in a spell book.  etc...\r\nI like commands better than using verbs ESPECIALLY in this case where the cabinet is not leaving the room.  I always ran into verb conflicts.  If you are placing instruction on an object that is traveling around, then I'd use verbs.  Just my opinion.\r\n12a.  I ran a script under this command.  Print message \"You utter the magic word <i>alohomora</i>.  You hear a click and look toward the cabinet to see it swinging open.\"\r\n12b.  You must also add another script - set flag on object cabinet flag name <i>isopen</i>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway... I hate containers but this works.  If you need more help, please ask. \r\n\r\nAnd... I have a feeling that someone will come around with advice that makes mine sound ignorant but... that's how my brain works!!\r\n\r\nHappy gaming!",
