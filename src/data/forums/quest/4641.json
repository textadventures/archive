I have basically went and decided on two global packs - had two random numbers generated dependent on your level and so forth, store the two variables and then always draw card 1 from the pack, matched the card with the stored variable and if it differs go to the next card until it finds the correct one. <br/><br/>This is limiting me in what I wanted to achieve per room. I am surely going to ditch all my hard work for your suggestion.<br/>Thank you again.",
