I created 2 exits, one in and one out of a closet. The exit in was named &quot;closet&quot; and it has the alias &quot;closet&quot;. However, when I type in &quot;closet&quot;, the game says that it doesn't understand my command. What am I doing wrong? Is it even possible to do something with the engine like this?",
