Its elements are coded to match the directions listed above.  There is no \"downstair\" button, so it doesn't show up on the compass.  There should, however, be a \"Downstairs\" listed in the Places & Objects pane, if I'm not misremembering.  (If you're feeling really froggy, you can edit the games HTML code with JS to manipulate the compass buttons, but I'd advise against it unless you like to adjust the same bit of code 100 times until you get it to look right on your computer, only to find out that it looks totally different on everyone else's computer due to different screen resolutions.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I would leave the \"down\" exit intact.  Then, create a command in the room with the command pattern ```descend;descend stair;descend stairs;downstair;downstairs``` and code the script to move the player object to the correct room (which I assume would be the room down from the current room).\r\n\r\nAlso, I would create a \"stair\" (or \"stairs\") object.  Then add a verb with the command pattern ```descend;down;go down``` and script that to move the player object to the correct room.
