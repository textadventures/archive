He must repeat a mantra - &quot;My mind is a fortress, but my heart is free&quot; - in order to snap out of his brainwashed haze and begin the game.\n\nI'd like the player to have to type the mantra in order to continue.  I thought I could make the entire phrase a command, and then trigger a move to the first real room in the game (an abandoned warehouse).  That doesn't seem to be working, though.\n\nCheck out my game file.  I'm trying to do some fancy stuff for the intro.  Not sure if I'm heading down the right path, though.  Is there a way to do an intro without having it be a script that runs before entering the first room?  Does this have anything to do with why my command isn't working?",
