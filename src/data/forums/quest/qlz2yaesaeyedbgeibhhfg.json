      "EditableText": "Alrighty. Let's begin :D (Pardon me for my bad English)\r\n\r\nIf you're talking about how the ammo is finite, you may as well want it to be stackable. I did a little research, and probably this site may help you:\r\nhttps://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Library:-Stackable-items\r\n..though it involves a custom library\r\n\r\nAnyways, back to the main topic. So first of all, you said that the player begins with this, if you may, a stack of ammo, and by time, the player may need more ammo. (Btw if you're only having problem with picking up then you can go to the ammo object tab and click on inventory tab. Make sure you've got the \"object can be taken\" box ticked)\r\n\r\nBut is the ammo location is set specifically just like those in battle royale-like games? Or, are you talking about ammo whose location may change by time?\r\n\r\n If you're thinking about games where the ammo location is set, you may want to put several other ammo in rooms. Just make sure the alias is the same for the same type of ammo (or you can do clone object) and make sure it works the same as the ammo the player has at the very beginning of the game.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking about ammo whose location may change by time, you can do this by setting up a script MoveObject that takes effect every few seconds or every turn. I think a turn script is the most befitting for this job, though.\r\nHowever, if this is what you're going to do, you may consider one problem: players may be irritated when they get into the room seeing the ammo laying in the same room but then it disappears few seconds after they get into the room. If that's the case, the players may have to keep running for hours just to pick up ammo, isn't that annoying? \r\n\r\nBecause of that, add another script to the turn script and put the previously mentioned script within this one. This script will be something like: IF \"player.parent=ammo.parent\" (this is only if your player \"name\" is player and if your ammo \"name\", not alias, is ammo) then nothing happens. Else, move object ammo to object **somewhere** (if you're not using _run script after few seconds_)\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure if that's what you're searching for, but hope it helps!\r\n",

for a vey specific game design/play reason)\r\n\r\n1. handguns\r\n2. shotguns\r\n3. rifles\r\n4. machine guns\r\n5. grenade launchers // (ya, a 'grenade' is not the same as a 'bullet', but we don't care because the game doesn't care, lol)\r\n\r\n*\r\n6. rocket launchers (this uses its own, and very rare, ammo type: 'rockets', so, it's a 'novel' weapon mostly, not usually used in most normal game play): I'm going to ignore this weapon (as I don't want to write in its own 'rocket-ammo' inventory crate and 'rocket-ammo' storage  crate objects and attributes below, lol)\r\n*\r\n\r\nmelee weapons (mostly for a fall back, if you run out of ammo, a means of always being able to do damage, though you can also steal items from monsters/bosses if have the ability to do so on the club, which is separate from the dropped items from them):\r\n\r\n7. clubs (obviously, has no 'ammo' mechanic, lol)\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nObjects:\r\n\r\npretend examples (as I don't know guns/gun-names very well, lol)\r\n\r\n1. gun1A // (handgun type)\r\n2. gun1B // (handgun type) // just to show you there's multiple individual guns (of each gun type)\r\n3. gun2 // (machine gun type)\r\n4. gun3 // (rifle type)\r\n5. gun4 // (shotgun type)\r\n6. gun5 // (grenade launcher type)\r\n\r\n7. inventory_ammo_crate // you got a separate 'ammo crate' in your inventory to hold extra

examples\r\n\r\ngun1A.attack = 10 // damage per shot/bullet (though it's a bit more complicated as there's a defense stat/attribute that reduces your damage done, and vice versa, as you can wear armors too, as well as some other stuff too)\r\n\r\ngun1B.attack = 50 // damage per shot/bullet (though it's a bit more complicated as there's a defense stat/attribute that reduces your damage done, and vice versa, as you can wear armors too, as well as some other stuff too)\r\n\r\ngun1A.range = 5 // if you attack outside of this range/distance, you'll either miss or do minimal damage (1-3)\r\ngun3.range = 50  // if you attack outside of this range/distance, you'll either miss or do minimal damage (1-3)\r\n\r\ngun1A.maximum_magazine = 6 // each gun has its own maximum magazine/ammo capacity (based on its gun type)\r\ngun1A.current_magazine = 6 // hopefully self explanatory (current/remaining shots/ammo in your gun)\r\n\r\ngun1B.maximum_magazine = 6 // each gun has its own maximum magazine/ammo capacity (based on its gun type)\r\ngun1B.current_magazine = 6 // hopefully self explanatory (current/remaining shots/ammo in your gun)\r\n\r\ngun2.maximum_magazine = 40 // each

0\r\n\r\n(being a real time game, there's also many duration attributes as well: reload duration, attacking duration, for guns with multiple shots per attack: duration between shots, recovery duration: after your attack or last shot, and likely a stun/damaged/recovery \"stun-lock\" duration)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nyou'll reload automatically during battle, if you got ammo still in your inventory ammo crate, though with this being a real time game, you got the reload animation duration, which leaves you vulnerable\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nyou can also reload (or unload) your guns outside of battle, via in your menu inventory: transferring ammo to/from between your guns and your inventory ammo crate\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nwhen at the area with your storage ammo crate, you can transfer your ammo to/from between your inventory ammo crate and your storage ammo crate, or directly between your guns and the storage ammo crate too\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nthe game also has various abilities (controlled by the number of 'slots': 'current_slots' and a hidden 'maximum_slots' on every weapon, on your weapons: 1 ability per slot) on your weapons as well, which you can transfer between weapons (one aspect of customizing/crafting an ultimate weapon, which is what makes it such a unique system/design/mechanic):\r\n\r\nRoF (rate of fire = number of shots per attack, in this case, lol): x1, x2, x3, x5, x7, x10 // you don't want to slap 'x10 RoF' on a rifle type of gun, as they're very slow, for an example\r\n\r\nand there's a bunch of other abilities too\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nalso, every weapon has 'base stats' (attributes): which are NON-transferable\r\n\r\nand also every weapon has 'plus stats' (attributes): which ARE transferable\r\n\r\nbase stat + plus stat = total stat\r\n\r\nexample: gun1A.base_attack + gun1A.plus_attack = gun1A.damage\r\n\r\nthere's items that will permanently increase a weapon's 'plus stat', but there's 'tool' items and 'super tool' items, that allows you to transfer all the plus stats (or just one ability)  from one weapon to another weapon, so you can create/bulk-up a really powerful ultimate weapon\r\n\r\nthe same for armor as well, having stats and abilities too\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nso, this is a really fun, well/smoothly/cleanly, unique RPG and projectile combat design/mechanic/system game",

too</p>\n<hr>\n<p>also, every weapon has 'base stats' (attributes): which are NON-transferable</p>\n<p>and also every weapon has 'plus stats' (attributes): which ARE transferable</p>\n<p>base stat + plus stat = total stat</p>\n<p>example: gun1A.base_attack + gun1A.plus_attack = gun1A.damage</p>\n<p>there's items that will permanently increase a weapon's 'plus stat', but there's 'tool' items and 'super tool' items, that allows you to transfer all the plus stats (or just one ability)  from one weapon to another weapon, so you can create/bulk-up a really powerful ultimate weapon</p>\n<p>the same for armor as well, having stats and abilities too</p>\n<hr>\n<p>so, this is a really fun, well/smoothly/cleanly, unique RPG and projectile combat design/mechanic/system game</p>\n\n",
