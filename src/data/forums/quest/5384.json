There's probably other stuff involved that I know nothing about. Hopefully the power produced remains a simple thing. From there you just plug the force (convert watts to newtons I think) and the opposing forces of friction into the proper physics equation to get acceleration. Probably everything can be found on wikipedia and hyperphysics.",
