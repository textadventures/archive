One way around this, which would be a fair bit of work, would be to code your own compass pane. Disable the standard panes, code an HTML file to display a compass. Compass buttons run Javascript code to call ASLEvent to send commands into Quest, and Quest can use RunScript requests to enable/disable buttons as appropriate.

I think that completly understand how it works and can get the most out of the current features.\n\nSuggestion, the compass buttons should look at the type instead of the alias and then if there is more than one of the same type, give the menu listing the aliases.  That way if there are two east exits (based on type), when you click the east compass button then instead of selecting from east or east you could select from something like &quot;right hand door on east wall&quot; and &quot;left hand door on east wall&quot;.  Now if the user uses the shortcut alt name &quot;e&quot; that would be the same as clicking on the compass East button and the user would have to select from the same menu.  I wouldn't involve the prefixes at all.\n\nSorry it I sound bossy and demanding.  Clearly you have put a lot of work and thought into the whole thing and I think the program is spectatular.  Hope you don't mind all these sugestions.  You can take them or leave them.\n\nFor now I can almost get it to work just the way I want and I think it will be fine except that the two east exits are listed in Places and Objects so some users who are use to glancing at the compass may not realize they can go east at all let alone two diffrent eastern doors.  Oh well, that's their problem, all the info is there in at least two places already.  If they can't look around the screen then they are handycaping themselves.",
