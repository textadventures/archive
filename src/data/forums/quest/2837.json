If you draw the map yourself (e.g. in photoshop, or GIMP as I used), split the room up into transparent .png files, it will then overlaying the map parts on top of one another gives you a built up map. I've added an object type mapview, which then needs to be added to new rooms. It adds a naming convention and overrides the firstenter property to add the room's name to a list of visited rooms. This list is passed into a javascript function when &quot;map&quot; is given as a command. The javascript then overlays all the maps parts of it knows have been visited.\n\nThe files enclosed are a very simple, hand-drawn four room example:\n[attachment=0:1ws2yqhg]<!-- ia0 -->MapTest.zip<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:1ws2yqhg]\nOther than automatically creating a world map from standard items, this gives the designer a chance to make his own style of map, and also avoids any problems to do with alignment, e.g. how to deal with up and down.

I've left a debugging notice in there, which prints the known visited rooms.\n\nIf anyone would give me some tips on improving this, I'd be grateful. I don't know how to make the screen look more visually pleasing, as the map is printed in a fixed position. If you type too many commands then you: i) type over the map ii) a certain point it starts to scroll up.
