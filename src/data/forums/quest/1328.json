How would you implament this, if you can, like edit libraries while the server's down (and saved as standard save file), then start it up again, will it accept the new library or have a fuss??",

So if a player already has an object, but you've updated that object's take script, the changes won't be reflected when the game loads (at least until a player takes that object again).",
