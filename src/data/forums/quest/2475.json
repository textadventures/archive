In the ASL file I can see those characters are stored as &quot;?&quot; in the file, so QDK isn't even saving them properly.\n\nI can see if I paste those characters in to a room description box, they paste OK, but when I click the &quot;ASL&quot; button on the toolbar they've been replaced.\n\nI'll have a look to see if this can be fixed easily in Quest 4. These kinds of characters can often cause problems with VB6 programs (which Quest 4 is - Quest 5 should work with these without a problem).",
