[/quote:2yweuv99]\n\nWell if you are just going for an ultra simplistic 'card game' in that you don't want to have the player see what actual cards he has and so on, then this is really easy to do.  I'm assuming you are starting the game with the player and the NPC equal, say having $5 each (or 5 items whatever...)\n\nAll you need to do is set a numeric variable to 5 and then use a random number to decide if the player or NPC has won each hand.  If the player wins you add one to the control variable, if the player loses you deduct one from the variable. (Printing messages as appropriate obviously).\n\nWhen the numeric variable reaches 10, the player has won and it is game over,  if instead the numeric variable hits 0 then the NPC has won and it is also game over. \n\nThis is simple in the extreme, if you want to replicate (say) playing some form of Poker  you are going to have to do some serious code slinging.  Things like monitoring the pack (there is only 1 Ace of Spades for instance - you can't just generate cards randomly) and implementing the hand scoring rules of the game would be a LOT of work.\n\nIf you want I will cobble up the 'simple' version as a demo for you - just post here (or e-mail me) if that will be helpful at all.\n\nAl (MaDbRiT)",

Back when I did my stint in IBM (yes, it really was a jail sentance). <br/><br/>We use lotus notes here, so I really can't imagine anything by Lotus being good. </p></blockquote><br/><br/>I know where you are coming from with Notes... Interface from hell IMHO and about as counter-intuitive a product as I have ever had the misfortune to have to use.<br/><br/>That said, I still prefer Lotus 123 to MS Excel.  I have sixteen plus year old Lotus spreadsheets (DOS version 3 and earlier) with complicated macros that still work fine under latest 123  (Windows) version 9.8.  These require minimal upkeep and support.  Complicated Excel spreadsheets seem to break horribly with each new release of the host package and need loads of attention.<br/><br/>Lotus 123 was THE application that put the PC on the map of course, it goes back that far.<br/><br/>Al (MaDbRiT)",
