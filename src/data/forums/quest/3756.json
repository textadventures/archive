All is going smoothly, except that after the first couple of verbs I created, every one of them comes up blank! This is very frustrating, considering the fact that the &quot;Value&quot; section for each verb has the appropriate text in it, yet the field to edit it is blank and running through the game and accessing the appropriate commands brings up a blank response. I would be most appreciative for any advice that can be offered.",
