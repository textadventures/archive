      "EditableText": "Hi,  I am writing my first ever game using quest... Basically I am stuck with a travelling set up.  I have a jeep set up as a useable object in the game. When I use it, I want it to ask the question &quot;Where would you like to go?&quot;.  If the player gives the correct response, for eg. &quot;station&quot; (found in puzzles beforehand) then the Jeep will move the player to a new location (the station) where the second part of the story can begin.  I have seen similar things done in other people's games but I can't work it out.\n\nI have battled with this for the best part of an hour now and I am stumped.  I have read and re-read the sections about scripts for questions and for inputs, but honestly I am raw new to this and really need some help... If anyone could help me I would appreciate it as I'm very excited to get my adventure out there for you all to play and this is a necessary part!\n\nThanks in advance for any help you guys can give!\n\niCFspectre",

I did find this out with a bit of fiddling, but inserting the script manually proved to be harder than expected, I would prefer to do it with the GUI, simply because it keeps it neat and the same as the rest of the game.  As the game I'm planning is going to be enormous and long, my plan is to release the game as &quot;episodes&quot; so in this case, travelling to the station will actually end the game...\n\nThis can only work if I can add a message AFTER the game ends to inform players that the following episode is imminent... the reason for this is that I would quite like my game to be practically endless and also give you the option to play the story in different ways, so certain choices you make will give you multiple out comes and push you in different directions... As a survival horror game, I think the element of free will and good vs bad will be a decent factor... Hopefully people will agree.  Spent the best part of 13 hours straight on Sunday with Nathan working on the build for episode 1 and am probably around 75% complete with it. :/\n\nThis game making malarkey is hard lol... If anyone is free to help me ever I have skype if it's easier to help me directly rather than on here. I will try and finish the rest of the areas and pad them out before implementing your script.  I want the game to be insanely detailed, I have written paragraph descriptions for like a toilet.  Also another feature we've added in is &quot;easter eggs&quot;, one per episode... So when you interact with a certain object in a certain way, something completely absurd will occur which will hopefully make the more investigative players laugh.  It will also keep people looking through the items, as I've added like 50 interactive items per room.\n\nI'd love some feedback on the ideas I've just laid out if you have the time to read all my babbling!\n\niCFspectre",
