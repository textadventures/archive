Changing objects and rooms during a game looks great, though I do wish there were examples in the docs.\n\nI can now change what the player sees when typing \"look\" by writing a \"look\" property for an object or room. So if the player hits someone in a fight, then the hit could also include a change in the \"look\" of the person being hit?\n\nMaybe someone could give some examples of the new features and place them in a story context.\n\nNow that we have 3.5, we can hope Al is not too far behind with a conversation update to his MaDbRiT's Type Library.\n\nChuck",
