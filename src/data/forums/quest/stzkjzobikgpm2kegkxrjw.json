I am now starting to have a problem, my game consists of a character wanting to work for money. When I create a page, and this page is set to where I click on it in the game its suppose to keep adding the x amount of dollars I earned, I get it to where if I check my money, it start at zero, when I click the link and then re check money it goes to 25. When I click the link again it doesn't add it to previous amount. \r\n\r\nHow do I go about doing this? Thank you",
