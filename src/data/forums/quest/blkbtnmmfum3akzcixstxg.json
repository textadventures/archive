      "EditableText": "What do you mean by an \"ending\"?\r\n\r\nIn a **text adventure**, you could search the whole file for the script command `finish`, which displays a game over. Not sure if the editor has that function, but you can easily open the file in Notepad or your favourite text editor just to search; it will at least let you find them.\r\n\r\nIf you've got a function that calls `finish`, or ends the game some other way, you might have to search for that separately. It depends a lot on the structure of your game.\r\n\r\nIf you mean a **gamebook**, that's a bit weird… because as far as Quest is concerned, a gamebook doesn't *have* an ending. If a page doesn't have any links leading away from it, the player can't go anywhere because there's nothing to click on - but the game isn't aware of that and keeps waiting for input just the same.\r\n\r\nHowever, you could possibly search for all the endings using a little script. If you temporarily add a 'script' page that does something like the following:\r\n```\r\nforeach (page, AllObjects()) {\r\n  ending = true\r\n  if (page.name = \"player\") {\r\n    ending = false\r\n  }\r\n  if (ending and HasAttribute (page, \"options\")) {\r\n    foreach (opt, page.options) {\r\n      if (not opt = page.name) {\r\n        ending = false\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  if (ending) {\r\n    msg (\"Page \" + page.name + \" looks like an ending.\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen you can visit that page to get a list of all the pages that don't have links.\r\nOf course, there may be false positives if you've included links in the page text. To check for those, you would modify the script, inserting:\r\n```\r\n  if (ending and HasString (page, \"description\")) {\r\n    if (IsRegexMatch(\"\\\\{(page|object|exit|command):\", page.description)) {\r\n      ending = false\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nbefore the final\r\n```\r\n  if (ending) {\r\n```\r\nHowever, this isn't perfect… it could still get confused in some cases. But it would find all the pages without exits unless you have some pretty complex scripting going on.\r\n\r\nIt's not perfect; but it might help.",
