All my translations for 'close' work, so I thought I should be able to manage 'open' as well. But when I try the easiest translation of all, which is 'open' for 'open', Quest says 'You can't open it.' (in Dutch) The other translations for open do work, but 'open' is the word I think a Dutch player would use most, so I would like to include that. \n\nThe same kind of problem I have with 'ask'. The translation of 'Tell object about ...' works fine, but 'Ask object about ...' doesn't. \n\nI would very much appreciate it if someone could take a look at my language file and point out what I did wrong.",
