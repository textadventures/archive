      "EditableText": "So, here's my issue. I've got a room, let's call it Room A. I've got a second room, let's call it Room B. Room A and Room B are connected at a lower-right diagonal; this connection is 3x the length of a normal room-to-room connector. \r\n\r\nIf I move from Room A to Room B and then back to Room A, my icon on the map grid only travels approximately the normal 1x distance back along the 3x connector to Room A. The game treats it as if I've re-entered Room A, which I technically speaking have done as the room description pops up stating so; however, this completely breaks the map as my icon is no longer going from room-to-room as it should do, but is instead wildly offset from where it should be.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this?\r\n\r\nAs an addendum, another issue I'm having is that if I move the player from one room to another that they haven't yet explored, the game gives me this: 'Error running script: Error evaluating expression 'DictionaryItem(coordinates, coordinate)': The given key was not present in the dictionary.'\r\n\r\nAny help would be mightily appreciated!",
