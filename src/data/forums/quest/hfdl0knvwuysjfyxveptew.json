First question is an easier one I think: \r\nHow can i enable arrow-navigation for the player while still individualisitcly naming the rooms in the desription. (For example, when I rename \"south\" to \"XYs room\" then the arrow vanishes. How can I prevent this? \r\n2. I want to make fight possible and until now everything went well, the pistols shoot only if loaded, decrease the munition counter etc. \r\nBut now I want to make the chance of hitting a target a certain percent level, depending on a player attribute. (So the hitting chance (percentage should be as high as the attribute \"shooting skill\"- but this doesnt work ; \r\n```if (GetInt(Police Gun, \"Munition\") = 0) {\r\n  msg (\"Nothing happens, there is no munition left\")\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  DecreaseObjectCounter (Police Gun, \"Munition\")\r\n  if (RandomChance( = Shooting)) {\r\n    msg (\"You hit the drone with the bullet and it falls from the sky.\")\r\n    DisableTimer (droneattack)\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    msg (\"Your bullet misses the drone.
