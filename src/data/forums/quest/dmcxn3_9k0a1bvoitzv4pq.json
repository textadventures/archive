(started in 1980 or so)â€¦<br>\nSo I am new with Quest and objects, but I know how to do the same thing without them, BUT, I will try to push objects where I can.<br>\nI'm on a project at the moment, that is quickly approaching 300K in size. (Oh, 304K right now, with over 400 rooms.)<br>\nI'll have to give it some thought, and may require help from the Quest wizards for some of it...<br>\nThe existing tutorial can get you started with commands and how to put them together, but I agree, it does miss a lot.</p>\n\n",
