So, if it's obvious or readily available information, please forgive me.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a way to 'reload' a room's object and location list automatically, but I can't find a way within a script to get this to happen. Any advice? I want to change an object in the room once a player interacts with another item, but it only blanks out the first object and does not show the new one until they back out of the room and come back in.\r\n\r\nSame thing with a created exit. A button is pushed and an exit SHOULD be available, but it doesn't show up until after they leave and come back. Any help would be appreciated. ",
