      "EditableText": "Hi there. \r\n\r\nI'm trying to have one single image cover the entire background of my game, including the margins - however, even while I can change the opacity of the page color, I can't seem to remove the flat-color option for the margins. I had envisioned my workaround could be having an image for the margins and then setting the page color to 0% opacity so the margin image could seep through, but I'm not sure if that would work. How can I get rid of the margin color default? Is there a better way to do this? For context, I want my whole game to appear on a static image of college-ruled paper.\r\n\r\nI'm using the browser editor as I don't have a Windows computer. I hope this is possible to do without being able to edit the base code.",
