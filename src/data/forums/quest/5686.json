If you eat the cantaloupe, a flag 'eaten' goes on cantaloupe and the cantaloupe is removed at that point.  If you look at the room description again, there is no mention of a cantaloupe because it has been eaten.  Removing an item does not also remove a flag.  In fact, with the muffin, I eat the muffin, remove the muffin, go to sleep, wake up, move muffin to current room, and voila! a new muffin appears.",
