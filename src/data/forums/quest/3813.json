What I'm trying to do is check to see if I had created an exit so I wouldn't create the same exit later (with the same name.  I'm assuming that too would generate an error).  If I hadn't created an exit, is there something else I can use to check for this?  At this point, I'm not sure how to handle the errors and I am trying to make it so my game generates exits randomly each time it starts.\n\nThanks.",
