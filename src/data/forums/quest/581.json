For example, a window will open that will say, &quot;Please type in your password,&quot; and directly beneath that, a open space to type in your code, and you can hit &quot;enter&quot; to enter the code. I know how to make windows pop up, but is it POSSIBLE to be able to do as I've just described? Thanks",

      "EditableText": "Hey ITID, you said you might remember how to make a text entry popup in quest. Can you try to think of how you did it? If you could, I'd greatly appreciate it. P.S. To Most People In These Forums: Uhhggh, how do you deal with all this code and asl stuff? As I look through the threads, I always see people posting code, and it just gets me so nervous. I could learn it if I wanted to; I actually started, but stopped after I decided it was a waste of time to learn, since I probably wouldn't use it so much, and I actually ENJOY using the QDK interface. Plus, everyone is always talking about all these complicated methods for programs; I always find such simple ways. Oh well; Maybe I'm just too dumb to enjoy asl coding, lol. <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /><!-- s:shock: -->  <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->",
