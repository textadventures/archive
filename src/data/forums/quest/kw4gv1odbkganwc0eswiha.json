That doesn't seem to be the case right now.\r\n\r\nThat's assuming that you are using the web editor. If it's the desktop editor, I don't know of any common problems, although I know that there is some weird behaviour if you don't run the editor as an administrator on Windows.\r\n\r\nIf none of those seem to apply, do you have a full error message you can show us?",
