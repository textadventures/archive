I have the 'fishing rod' set up as another object and move it to the player. \r\nNow since the 'snooker cue' and 'rope' are now called 'fishing rod', I want to remove them from the inventory list, but still be able to interact with them should the adventurer want to untie the 'rope' from the 'snooker cue'.\r\n\r\nI've tried making the 'fishing rod' a container and moving them into it but they still show up in the inventory.\r\nI've tried making them invisible, but you can't interact with them then.\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated.",
