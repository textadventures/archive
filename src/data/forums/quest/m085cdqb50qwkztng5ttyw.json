As noted, this is a script placed under the look at section for the birds, but it could be applied to a 'spin' verb on a wheel, or a n-sided dice roll (verb roll on dice), etc):\r\n\r\n1.

To keep it simple, set the variable 'x' = random number between number 1 and number 4.  I chose 4 in this case because I wanted to print a random message for each of the four directions I wanted the birds to fly (n,s,e,w).\r\n4.  Now, add another new script.  Add an 'If' script (can be clicked at top right of box.\r\n5.  In the 'If' of this script, it should look like this --> If expression x = 1\r\n6.  Then set variable direction = expression \"north.\"\r\n7.  I repeated this for my total number of possible outcomes only changing the x value to 2, 3, 4 and changing the expression equal to south, west, and east.\r\n8.

I typed a message like this for my bird example <b>WITH the quotes!</b>:  \"You watch the birds and they fly off toward the \" + direction.\r\n11.  What this does, is it take the 'direction' variable you set earlier, and places in a random direction 1-4.  \r\n\r\nThere might be an easier way which someone will come point out I'm sure, but this is how I know how to do it.",
