I know if you click it on the inventory you can get the use command.\n\nfor example in the tutorial, you take the defibrillator and it goes in your inventory , but then when you click on the defibrillators hyperlink again you do not have the option for use.\n\nam i missing something? \n\nthanks in advance.",
