Second, if you use a dictionary for the menu instead of a straight list (it supports both flavors), then you can pair up a string (e.g. &quot;human&quot;) with your desired result (e.g. the HumanRace object). And third, in the above example, all the race variables are nested under a &quot;race&quot; attribute.

      "HTML": "Your second question above is a bit harder to answer, mostly because it's less clear to me what you want to do. Here's a stab... If you keep a level of indirection for the type an object, then you could easily change types at runtime. If you want to have direct attributes, then you'd have to copy attributes:<br/><br/><pre><code><br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;ChairType&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;name&gt;chair&lt;/name&gt;<br/>  &lt;legs type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;4&lt;legs&gt;<br/>--etc--<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;StoolType&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;name&gt;stool&lt;/name&gt;<br/>  &lt;legs type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;3&lt;legs&gt;<br/>--etc--<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;object name=&quot;MySittingThing&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;type type=&quot;object&quot;&gt;ChairType&lt;/type&gt;<br/><br/>  &lt;domagic type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>     this&#46;type = StoolType<br/>  &lt;/domagic&gt;<br/>&lt;/object&gt;<br/><br/>---some code ---<br/><br/>msg(&quot;My seat type is &quot; + MySittingThing&#46;type&#46;name)<br/>do (MySittingThing, &quot;domagic&quot;)<br/>msg(&quot;My seat type is now &quot; + MySittingThing&#46;type&#46;name)<br/><br/>// You should see a change!<br/></code></pre><br/><br/>Or you could just copy attributes, perhaps using code like for races, but dynamically...
