It seems the label can only be a string because the map drawing script checks for the length and only displays the label if it's >0, as trying to set the label attribute to a script or anything else gives the error code:\r\n\r\n```Error running script: Error compiling expression 'LengthOf(room.grid_label) > 0': FunctionCallElement: Could find not function 'LengthOf(LazyLoadScript)'```\r\n\r\nI don't know how to (or if I even can) find and edit that part of the code so that it will always display labels - as my rooms are all labelled anyway - and just using ```<br>``` in the label string doesn't parse it as a line break. Any ideas? Thanks in advance :)",
