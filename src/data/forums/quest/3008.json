But I'm using quest the online version and I just wondered how I delete a text adventure that I have started making, as I messed it up and wish to start over. And also how do you rename one that you started too?\n\nI can only see edit and publish near the game I have created, and also start a new game. \n\nThanks\nDevis  <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
