I'm still a noobie and suck at programming but i'm having fun creating my own games using the GUI. i'm busy working on 3 at the moment. One has potential and would like some help please. I definetly do not want any of my games coming out before they are ready. So without further ado, here are 3 of my main challenges at the moment. \n\nFirstly, how do i get the player to either click on a restart hyperlink or type &quot;restart&quot; and it will take them to the start again or must they use ctrl+R at the end of a game. Same with exiting. \n\nThe next i want to know how to enable and disable hyperlinks if a player chooses &quot;beginner&quot; or &quot;expert&quot; in the beginning of my game e.g ive created a new string called gamedif with the 2 choices above and menu text &quot;Game difficulty?&quot; Then if a player chooses &quot;beginner&quot; then hyperlinks must be enabled else not.\n\nLastly, if a player drinks some water from a water bottle which has a weight of 1000 grams,  how would i decrease it by say 50 grams everytime he takes a sip.\n\nI know these seem fairly simple and yes i have gone through all the tutorials but i cant seem to figure this out.\n\nPlease help and thanks again.",
