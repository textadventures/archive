      "EditableText": "So, I'm kind of new at this language, but I have some programming experience. I'm confused by the way the language treats attributes.  There seems to be a difference in the way you can call custom attributes versus built-in attributes.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I want to output the pattern of the shirt the character is wearing. (Not my actual use case, but it highlights the problem I'm trying to figure out in a simple way.)\r\n\r\nI create a wearable item \"shirt\" and give it a custom attribute \"pattern\" with the value \"polka dots\".  I set it to the wear slot \"upper,\" then I put that shirt on my character.\r\nNext, I make a button in the character's room that runs this function when pressed:\r\n```\r\n  <function name=\"test_script\">\r\n    OutputTextNoBr (\"You are wearing a shirt with the pattern: \")\r\n    msg (GetOuter(\"upper\").pattern)\r\n  </function>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work.  I get the error message: \r\n```\r\nYou are wearing a shirt with the pattern: Error running script: Error compiling expression 'GetOuter(\"upper\").pattern': Unknown object or variable 'pattern'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOkay, I thought, this language just doesn't know how to use the .attribute syntax on the result of a function in an expression.  But then I tried something.  I changed the function to do this instead:\r\n```\r\n  <function name=\"test_script\">\r\n    OutputTextNoBr (\"You are wearing a shirt with the name: \")\r\n    msg (GetOuter(\"upper\").name)\r\n  </function>\r\n```\r\nLo and behold, it works!  I get the output:\r\n```\r\nYou are wearing a shirt with the name: shirt\r\n```\r\nIt also seems to work with .type, .parent, or any other built-in attribute.  Why are custom attributes different in this way? Is there any way to do what I'm trying to do with a custom attribute?\r\n\r\nThank you!",
