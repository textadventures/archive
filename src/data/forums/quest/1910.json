What is the syntax for getting that property from the object once it has been passed into my WeaponDamage function ?\n\n2. Is it returned as a numeric value or string, and does it matter much in ASL ?\n\n3. If it is returned as a number, can I still use it in a msg&lt;&gt; statement without conversion ?\n\nAny advice appreciated,\n\nThanks\n\nRW",
