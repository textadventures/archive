I can see that there is a conflict between the turn script running ever turn and needing to wait 2 turns before moving the NPC (the wait is for the player to have  a chance to interact briefly before the NPC wanders off), but I cannot figure out how to reconcile that (i've tried nesting an 'after 2 turns' script within the original turn script, but it doesn't work). How do I arrange for the turn script to check if the NPC has come into the room, print messages if he has, and then allow him to hang around for a couple of turns before disappearing again?\r\n\r\nThanks...\r\n",
