But, of course, I don't know how to do this.  What I would like is something along the lines of:\n\nWhat is thy name?\n(insert account name here.)\n\nIf the account is known then it would proceed to:\n'What is thy word of passing?'\n(insert password here)\n\nIf the account isn't know then:\n&quot;I do not know that name.  Are you new here?&quot;\n(enter either yes or no here)\n\nIf it is yes, I want them to be able to register account information after a long and lengthy set of rules in order to keep from angering the gods, if no, then I want it to go back to 'What is thy name.'\n\nAfter registration I would like them to proceed to character creation where they would choose their ingame name, race, general characteristics like eyecolor and hair color, etc etc, before getting to go into the game itself.\n\nI know all this requires loops, arrays, and lots of variables.....HELP!  If someone could just point me in the right direction I will do my best not to annoy you.\nThanks, Shadow*",
