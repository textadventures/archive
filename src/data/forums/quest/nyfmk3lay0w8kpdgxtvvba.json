However, when I write something like \"NeilNPC.parent\", the game tells me that it can't find the object. It'll find NeilNPC just fine if I instead put in \"Neil.parent\" though. This is especially weird because \"player.parent\" works just fine when I've given the player a different alias.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or am I completely misunderstanding how Quest deals with names and aliases?",
