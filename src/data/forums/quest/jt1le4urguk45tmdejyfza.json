Following the tutorial for the combination lock and the random number section located in that tutorial, you are setting the script to run in the start script. Cannot see a specific attribute that says 'code' in the 'game' object itself, or the 'keypad' object. But doing either of your other suggestions does seem to work. The tutorial, then, might need updating.</p>\n\n",
