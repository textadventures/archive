I tried this by using &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tags. The names are bold in the objects pane, but then when i perform an action with the character the tags show up (eg. &quot;You talked to &lt;b&gt;John&lt;/b&gt;.

I think this will be really complicated so not sure if its for the best\n\n\nThanks for any help people can give \n\nMMX3",

The reason I'm asking is I'm not sure where you're seeing the problem, as your two solutions address different areas of the user interface.\n\nIf you're using hyperlinks for objects, you could set the character hyperlinks to be a different color from other objects. That would make them appear differently in the standard text window at least.\n\nIf you did want two panes, there was some code I worked on for someone a number of months back that created a second object pane. That could be modified for this use.",
