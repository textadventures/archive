If you tried to create that function in a game, you'd get an error immediately. But Quest doesn't check function validity when running, loading, or publishing. The error will only come up if you try to use the `Possessive` function (which you don't), or when you try to *save* a project that contains it.\r\n\r\nIf you copied that function into your game, it would refuse to save because it's invalid. But because it's in a library, the error goes unnoticed until it tries to save the function as part of a saved game.\r\n\r\nIf I understand the function correctly, it should be something like:\r\n```\r\n  <function name=\"Possessive\" parameters=\"owner, object\" type=\"string\">\r\n    if (owner = game.pov) {\r\n      if (DoesInherit (object, \"masculine\") or DoesInherit(object, \"male\")) {\r\n        return (\"il tuo\")\r\n      }\r\n      else if (DoesInherit (object, \"female\") or DoesInherit(object, \"female\")) {\r\n        return (\"la tua\")\r\n      }\r\n      else if (DoesInherit(object, \"maleplural\")) {\r\n        return (\"i tuoi\")\r\n      }\r\n      else if (DoesInherit(object, \"femaleplural\")) {\r\n        return (\"le tue\")\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    else if (DoesInherit(owner, \"maleplural\") or DoesInherit(owner, \"femaleplural\")) {\r\n      if (DoesInherit (object, \"masculine\") or DoesInherit(object, \"male\")) {\r\n        return (\"il loro\")\r\n```\r\nand so on… but I'm pretty sure that is not a sane way for that function to work.\r\n\r\nIf you're on the desktop version of Quest, you can find the file `Languages/Italiano.aslx` somewhere under where Quest is installed, and either fix or remove the `Possessive` function.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the web version, unfortunately you'll have to wait for someone with access to the webserver to fix it.",
