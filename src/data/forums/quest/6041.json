Then, add an 'If' statement. In your If options, you can add Random Chance, which allows you to set a % based chance of that thing happening. So, as an example, let's say you have four outcomes; Outcome 1, you come across a goblin. Outcome 2, you find a ruined temple. Outcome 3, you fall down a hole. Outcome 4, you find nothing of interest.\n\nYou make the if check, and have it start with If Random Chance 25%, move player to page 'Forest Goblin Encounter'.\nNext, you do an 'Else If'. Else if Random Chance 25%, move player to 'Forest Ruined Temple'.\nElse If Random Chance 25%, move player to 'Forest Hole'.\nElse (not Else if, Else is 'if nothing else triggers, this always happens'), move player to 'Forest Nothing'.",
