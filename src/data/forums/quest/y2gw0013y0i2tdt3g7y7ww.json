For example, I have a TV which can be switched on or off. Right now, both verbs show in the menu, but what I am hoping to achieve is only showing 'Switch on' when the TV is off, and 'Switch off' when the TV is on. I was thinking of running a script when the particular verb is executed, which would update the menu, but I can't seem to see how this can be achieved.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
