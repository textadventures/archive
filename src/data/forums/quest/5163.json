For example, showing a image of the player on the left side.. and as you equip items they get placed on top of the image creating a visual effect.\n\nAnother question I have is about the default commands like go... or move... can I edit them? for example imagine I want to remove the &quot;go&quot; or &quot;move&quot; command and only allow &quot;walk&quot;.\n\nThank you in advance <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->",
