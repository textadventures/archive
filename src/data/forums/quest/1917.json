I want to be able to give it out to friends, and -if possible- have them be able to play by just clicking on something (it can be a batch file, or even a .vbs script) that will launch the game. I don't want an install process (nothing permanently on the person's PC).  Is this possible?  Or is it at least possible only to install the player, and not the qdk?\n\nThanks in advance for any help/suggestions.",
