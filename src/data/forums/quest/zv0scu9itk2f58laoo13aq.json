Until you give it a value of another type, an attribute is `null`, which counts as an object.\r\n\r\nThe normal way to deal with object attributes is not to give them a default value unless there is a sensible default for them to have. (The types in `CoreTypes.aslx` do not contain *any* object attributes; because the sensible default for an object attribute is null, which is achieved by omitting it from the type).",
