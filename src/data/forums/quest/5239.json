Will the fact that the game is using the advanced features, set up on the desktop app, prevent or cause any difficulty for anyone who's still working on other aspects of the game through the web interface?  Or should we wait until everything else is done before adding those libraries?\n\nAs this is my first post on the forum let me also say a big thanks to everyone who maintains this great software and all the libraries!",

Or will the addition of those features cause a problem since they're not supported by the web interface.",

Once you download it you cannot upload it in an editable form (I suppose it might be possible to e-mail it to Alex, and he could upload it).\n\nIf you want the features added sooner rather than later, all of you need to be using the off-line version. It does allow you to do more, as you cannot add attributes in the on-line version. You would then need to share the game somehow. You could put it on GitHub, though that might be overkill, or save it in the cloud, eg with DropBox.",
