      "EditableText": "The way Quest handles alignment is just weird.\r\n\r\nSetAlignment will start a new div (a block of text for layout purposes) with the specified alignment.\r\nIf can't be done using the text processor, because all the text output together goes into the same div; so can't include the code to end one div and start a new one.\r\n\r\nSeveral built-in features, such as clearing the screen and displaying a menu, will also create a new div. And these all force it to be left-aligned.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the alignment of all text (including what's already on the screen), you could do:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"<style>#divOutput div { text-align: right !important }</style>\")\r\n```\r\nThat tells it that all divs inside #divOutput (the main output area) should be right-aligned, and the `important` means that this will override anything that would reset it. If you then wanted to centre one line, you'd have to do something like `SetAlignment(\"center !important\")` to overrule it.\r\n\r\nHowever, this (invisible) `<style>` line would be removed along with the rest of your output when the screen is cleared; returning everything to it's default behaviour.\r\n\r\nYou could use a line like:\r\n```\r\nJS.eval(\"$('<style>').text('#divOutput div { text-align: right !important }').appendTo('head');\")\r\n```\r\nto change the alignment of all output text, putting the `<style>` element in the document's header so that it isn't affected by clearing the screen. Text outside of `#divOutput` isn't touched when clearing the screen; but it also isn't touched when saving the game; so you'd have to do it again when the player loads a saved game.\r\n\r\nI know it's a lot to take in, and I really wish there was a better way to do this.",
