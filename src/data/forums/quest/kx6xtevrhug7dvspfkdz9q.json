I managed to get presave to work, but if preload and postload does not works, then there is not much point, right?<br>\nI suspect this library might be broken due to either the quest app engine new updates or the way that web browsers works have changed over the time.<br>\nhttps://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Library:-Save-and-Load<br>\nTo override the function of postload and etc, you need<br>\nhttps://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Overriding-Functions</p>\n<p>mrangel's \"User Interface Initialisation Script\"<br>\nDscription:<br>\nIt is already thoroughly explained on how to use it by mrangel, everything makes sense here, but somehow I could not get it to work, I am guessing this script only updates one-time stuffs like user interface and not changing-codes like variables and attributes which was what I was experimenting with.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I have a lame solution, but here it is<br>\nDescription:<br>\nBasically you politely ask the player to click an object verb/enter a specific room/do anything<br>\nwhenever the player loads a new game, lol.<br>\nThen you trigger the script you want to happen on the new \"game load\".<br>\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/57zl3sqjdeoeuqwqok9r5q/test</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5.8.6836.13983--&gt;\n&lt;asl version=\"580\"&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"English.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=\"Core.aslx\" /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=\"test4\"&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;fd4e0bd3-5e6f-4508-84d9-6979cfb98f24&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2024&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n    &lt;attr name=\"feature_advancedscripts\" type=\"boolean\"&gt;false&lt;/attr&gt;\n    &lt;inituserinterface type=\"script\"&gt;\n    &lt;/inituserinterface&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=\"room\"&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=\"editor_room\" /&gt;\n    &lt;isroom /&gt;\n    &lt;enter type=\"script\"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[\n      if (donkey.nose hair&lt; 3) {\n        msg (\"Description: Your donkey's nose hair is \"+donkey.nose hair + \"cm long.\")\n      }\n      else {\n        msg (\"Description: Your donkey's nose hair is \"+donkey.nose hair + \"cm long.\")\n        msg (\"Are you sure you do not want to cut the nose hair away?\")\n        MakeObjectVisible (hair trimmer)\n      }\n    ]]&gt;&lt;/enter&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"player\"&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=\"editor_object\" /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=\"editor_player\" /&gt;\n      &lt;object name=\"dynamic load game\"&gt;\n        &lt;inherit name=\"editor_object\" /&gt;\n        &lt;description&gt;After you load a new game, please click trigger once.&lt;/description&gt;\n        &lt;displayverbs type=\"stringlist\" /&gt;\n        &lt;inventoryverbs type=\"stringlist\" /&gt;\n        &lt;trigger type=\"script\"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[\n          donkey.nose hair = donkey.nose hair+1\n          msg (\"The game and attributes have been updated.&lt;br/&gt;Do not click trigger again unless you are loading a save file again.\")\n        ]]&gt;&lt;/trigger&gt;\n      &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"donkey\"&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=\"editor_object\" /&gt;\n      &lt;attr name=\"nose hair\" type=\"int\"&gt;0&lt;/attr&gt;\n      &lt;displayverbs type=\"stringlist\" /&gt;\n      &lt;inventoryverbs type=\"stringlist\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;exit alias=\"east\" to=\"room2\"&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=\"eastdirection\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/exit&gt;\n    &lt;object name=\"hair trimmer\"&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=\"editor_object\" /&gt;\n      &lt;visible type=\"boolean\"&gt;false&lt;/visible&gt;\n      &lt;take /&gt;\n      &lt;displayverbs type=\"stringlist\"&gt;\n        &lt;value&gt;Take&lt;/value&gt;\n      &lt;/displayverbs&gt;\n      &lt;inventoryverbs type=\"stringlist\"&gt;\n        &lt;value&gt;Drop&lt;/value&gt;\n      &lt;/inventoryverbs&gt;\n      &lt;trimthehair type=\"script\"&gt;\n        donkey.nose hair = 0\n        msg (\"Job done.\")\n      &lt;/trimthehair&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;object name=\"room2\"&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=\"editor_room\" /&gt;\n    &lt;exit alias=\"west\" to=\"room\"&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=\"westdirection\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/exit&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;verb&gt;\n    &lt;property&gt;description&lt;/property&gt;\n    &lt;pattern&gt;description&lt;/pattern&gt;\n    &lt;defaultexpression&gt;\"You can't description \" + object.article + \".\"&lt;/defaultexpression&gt;\n  &lt;/verb&gt;\n  &lt;verb&gt;\n    &lt;property&gt;trigger&lt;/property&gt;\n    &lt;pattern&gt;trigger&lt;/pattern&gt;\n    &lt;defaultexpression&gt;\"You can't trigger \" + object.article + \".\"&lt;/defaultexpression&gt;\n  &lt;/verb&gt;\n  &lt;verb&gt;\n    &lt;property&gt;trimthehair&lt;/property&gt;\n    &lt;pattern&gt;trim the hair&lt;/pattern&gt;\n    &lt;defaultexpression&gt;\"You can't trim the hair \" + object.article + \".\"&lt;/defaultexpression&gt;\n  &lt;/verb&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n",
