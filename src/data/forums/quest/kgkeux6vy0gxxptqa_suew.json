She is doing a mystery and wanted to implement a simple clue system, in which doing certain things (looking at objects, unlocking certain rooms, etc.) would put a non-droppable clue object into the player inventory.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the player can use a \"deduce\" command at any time to check to see if they have a sufficient number of clues, in which case the script will remove the clues to an offstage room and put a \"solution\" object into the player inventory. Possessing this object will allow the player to enter the final room and see the endgame.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is, I am trying to use Code View to simplify my IF-THEN-ELSE commands. I need to be able to check if a player has Clue1 AND Clue2 AND Clue3 (they get the solution), ELSE IF does the player NOT have Clue1 AND NOT have Clue 2 AND NOT have Clue3 (they get a \"You are clueless\" message), ELSE the player must have some but not all of the clues and they get a gentle prompt to keep exploring.\r\n\r\nI have tried and tried but I cannot get the code to work. My \"and\"s and \"or\"s seem to be in the wrong place. I found the online web tutorials about using ANDs in IF statements, but those pages do not refer to objects. I tried applying what those pages said to the code that showed up when I clicked on Code View, but it didn't seem to work . . .\r\n\r\nIf you need to see my code, let me know and I can post a screenshot.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\n-Hubble",

If you put three backticks (<code>```</code>) on a line by themself above and below it, it will stop the forum from mangling your code.
