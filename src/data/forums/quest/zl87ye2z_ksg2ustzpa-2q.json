Have found Quest wonderful to use despite my lack of knowledge and the tutorial worked great for me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm drawing blanks on how I should handle my next goal. I'm wanting to create a semi-realistic system regarding the player-character eating and metabolizing food. The player should be able to eat, for example, a sandwich. It would add calories and \"fullness\" to their respective attributes. I also would like calories to eventually process into a \"health\" or \"weight\" attribute. I'm hoping to have more calorie-dense foods to process into more \"weight\" or \"health\" than, say, a stalk of celery. I'm not wanting the calories to process immediately. I'm thinking it should process after a Rest command, perhaps.\r\n\r\nPardon my inexperience and for aiming way over my head. This is something I'm very excited for and would appreciate the help greatly.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
