Because I like having the objects in Red and the room in Black, but in words only mode i cant do that.",

Actually if you really want, it'd be most simple to use QDK And instead of Words only, just do script, and make the script code \"print\" a message. When the little box pops up for what you want it to print on the right, click the big T in the top toolbar next to the # % and $ signs. Those by the way help you with variables.\n\nSo if you wanted to make it say what your asking just type \n\n[code:2q1dopw7]msg &lt;|crJimmy|cb is here|nYou are in |clramtha's room&gt;[/code:2q1dopw7]\n\nthe |n being for new line, but if your using QDK you can just enter that it under print.",

      "EditableText": "I don't know if this is helpful to you at all, but if you really want to change a certain word in a msg tag to a different colour other than red, blue, green, and yellow, you can use the foreground &lt;&amp;H000000&gt; commands before a msg line.  You incorporate this with the [ [color=blue:2p05whje]|xn [/color:2p05whje] ] tag in a line.  This enables the next msg line you type to be connected to the previous one, rather than print out [i:2p05whje]below[/i:2p05whje] it.  for instance, here could be a take command for a pickle:\n\n[code:2p05whje]\n\ntake &#123;\n          msg &lt;You pick up the |xn&gt;\n          foreground &lt;&amp;HFEDA00&gt; \n          msg &lt;pickle |xn&gt;\n          foreground &lt;white&gt;\n          msg &lt;and look at it with a smile&#46;&gt;\n          give &lt;pickle&gt;\n&#125;\n[/code:2p05whje]\n\n[b:2p05whje]N.B.[/b:2p05whje] - for some reason, quest has reversed the hex system for the colours.
