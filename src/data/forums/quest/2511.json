It reminds me a lot of Intellisense in all the Microsoft programming environments.\n\nSo far, the only hurdle I see with Quest 5 is, not what you can do, but trying to figure out what you *should* do.  For the beginner/novice, that will be the greatest obstacle.  Of course, that is where tutorials, demo code, and the forums come in.\n\nNot just games, I also see quest as a great foundation for creating training courses.\n\nThanks again for all the effort you put into Quest.  I look forward to the finished product!",

In Quest 4 if you wanted to add a variable to a message, you added it by surrounding it in &quot;#&quot; characters.

We should probably add some XML markup to allow you to change it within a printed message, so in that case you could type the XML markup directly into the message, but I'd probably also add a &quot;formatted text&quot; option to the drop-down too. This would increase the size of the textbox, display formatted text, and add a formatting toolbar (using the existing Editor RichTextControl).\n\nTagged text: I think XML markup is not the right way to do this.
