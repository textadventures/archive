This problem has been fixed now, but there are still others that make me concerned.\n\nFor example, load times.  I do not know how many of you are working on games for real, but the average text adventure game is less than 200kb.  The average Quest game is something like 30kb.  My file for the complete game of &quot;Gathered in Darkness&quot; (all nine chapters) is over 2500kb.  There is no graphics or sounds...that is all plain ol' text.  I have a fast computer but you do not want to know how long it takes to load that thing to work on it.\n\nFor last years contest I shaved off seven chapters and tried to release it as the first of a trilogy or something.  To do this I copied and pasted what I needed from the large file to a new one.  I still ended up with a file of around 1500kb and introduced many new bugs in the process.  (I am not counting my spelling as a bug).  There were many complaints about the time taken to save and load games.  I dread the thought of what the load times will be on a completed version.\n\nSo why did I choose Quest in the first place.  The honest truth is &quot;flags.&quot;  The use of flags really suited the way I think of programming.  I have not found another interface that uses them as well though I am sure I can invent a workaround in some of the other programs.  I think Quest has tons of potential but I am starting to realize that some the problems players are going to have with completed games can not be fixed by me...only by altering the structure of the program itself.\n\nI am going to flatter myself for a moment and pretend that people are wondering why I did not release &quot;Gathered in Darkness&quot; in full after last years contest.  I suppose I could, I have an test version of the whole thing sitting right here.  I just do not feel that Quest can really handle something that big.  If I am going to release it, I have to make it a trilogy.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not smart enough to recreate some of the more difficult coding moments in other systems.  I am making test scenarios trying to figure it out but I have not solved all the problems yet.  While I work on it I am making smaller games in Adrift and Inform and learning allot.\n\nI am a big fan of Quest, but I no longer feel it is well suited for games of epic length and I wonder how it would really stand up against a gigantic RPG if someone ever finished one.  I will continue to monitor Quest, kinda like David W, and wait and see what happens in Quest 5.  I am not giving up on it forever, just for right now.\n\nMichael Millsap\n\nP.S.

I have not found another interface that uses them as well though I am sure I can invent a workaround in some of the other programs.  I think Quest has tons of potential but I am starting to realize that some the problems players are going to have with completed games can not be fixed by me...only by altering the structure of the program itself.<br/><br/>I am going to flatter myself for a moment and pretend that people are wondering why I did not release &quot;Gathered in Darkness&quot; in full after last years contest.  I suppose I could, I have an test version of the whole thing sitting right here.  I just do not feel that Quest can really handle something that big.  If I am going to release it, I have to make it a trilogy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I am not smart enough to recreate some of the more difficult coding moments in other systems.  I am making test scenarios trying to figure it out but I have not solved all the problems yet.  While I work on it I am making smaller games in Adrift and Inform and learning allot.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Quest, but I no longer feel it is well suited for games of epic length and I wonder how it would really stand up against a gigantic RPG if someone ever finished one.  I will continue to monitor Quest, kinda like David W, and wait and see what happens in Quest 5.  I am not giving up on it forever, just for right now.<br/><br/>Michael Millsap<br/><br/>P.S.  While we are all having milk and cookies here (that is what my Drill Sargent used to refer to whining as) I guess I can express my dismay at having created the two highest scoring Quest games of major competitions of all time yet not seeing them in the top ten list on textadventures.  Must have been the spelling.",

I know ziltch about coding, and I don't have a &quot;programmers&quot; mind. Yet I have produced two games which have gotten a relative amount of good comments and reviews. Do I care that its sitting next to a huge pile of steaming dung? Hell no. Why should I? This is the fcking Internet, for christs sake. WHO CARES.</blockquote><br/><br/>So what are your theories on why none of the big names in the IF world have ever written a game with Quest? Mine are:<br/><br/>a) because it's not good enough.<br/>b) because they take one look at the drivel on the main site and don't want anything they write sitting alongside it.<br/><br/>As for your games receiving a 'relative' amount of good comments and reviews, if that's the case then why did you post this a few days ago:<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>I was wondering if anyone would like to review my first ever published game? Its been up on the site for a year and the only review I got was from dther9, who is a complete idiot.</blockquote><br/><br/>One review and that's from a complete idiot. Yep, you certainly received a 'relative' amount of good comments and reviews there.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>Create an amazing, stupendous game for us, to show all the potential game makers out there that Quest isn't a pile of poop, as you seem to be pointing out. Just sitting there and complaining and whining about it doesn't get much done, does it? Stop and listen to yourself, because I can't recall a positive comment you have ever posted (apart for praise to Dr. Froth) about quest. </blockquote><br/><br/>There's a very good reason for that, y'know. It's - you ready for this? - because Quest games *are* a pile of poop. Sorry to break that to you but I thought you had a right to know. Now, if someone wants to write a good game with Quest (as Dr Froth did before he came to his senses and went to the Adrift/Inform camps) I'll write a good review of it. If they want to write a bad game... well, you can probably guess how that sentence is going to end, can't you?<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>You simply havn't done anything helpful except point out that every other system is better than Quest due to &quot;design flaws&quot;. If Quest is so crap, then how are there heaps of good games out there on the site? You only seem to be explaining how crap it is, not getting over it and admiring the decent games. </blockquote><br/><br/>Oh please. &quot;heaps of good games&quot;. Where oh where are these heaps of good games? The main site is full of one piece of drivel after another. Funnily enough, two minutes of checking out your comments and reviews shows you have almost as low an opinion of Quest games as I have:<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>Ugh. Im not even going to bother playing the damn thing.</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>Appalling. *cough*sandpit*cough*</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>Another peice of crap. Seriously, no grammer whatsoever. Many spelling mistakes.</blockquote><br/><br/>*peice* and then comments about spelling mistakes. Hahahahah.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>Oh and heres the Rating. 1 - Appalling</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>One of the more retarded and annoying games you have made. Once again, no correct grammer in sight.</blockquote><br/><br/>Want me to go on?<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Thanatos wrote:</cite>By the way, you ARE the only one who thinks this way.</blockquote><br/><br/>Yes, you tell yourself that. I'm sure it'll be consolation to you and the other three Quest users out there.",
