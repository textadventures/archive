When im editing the game and i open a tab with heavy scripting (Not so heavy really cause im starting to do the game) it randomly freeze, it happen like 75% of the time, and i got to close the aplication and open it again, its really frustrating, sometimes it happen when im choosing options from the scrolling menus for my scripts.\n\nLook like it dont happen in code mode, but i cant work in that mode cause i dont know about coding...\n\n多Someone have the same problem in the past? 多Someone fixed it? I doubt it is my computer cause it can run most of the new games at max graphics and, like i said, it is totally random, sometimes i can edit a script well, and then when i go to change it for some reason it freezes, sometimes no, im going mad ._.",

I even had this happened with a completely new file having one player, one room, and one function with one &quot;if&quot; statement. Usually happens when the editor tries to show me something new in the script graphical view, like when I click on a function, or go out of code editing mode, or even when I click on something, like &quot;cut&quot; for example. Basically the more things it has to display, the more chances it will completely freeze while doing anything. Few times it even froze while I was moving my mouse around over some drop down menus. As the menus have this mouse-over animation it got slower until completely stopped working, application window was showing (not-responding) and the task manager indicated it was taking 25% of CPU power, witch is 100% of one core.\n\n\nEDIT: One more thing I've noticed today is when I restart my PC it works fine for a while, then it becomes slower and slower even if all I'm doing is viewing existing functions and not adding or changing anything, then after a while it takes so long to display anything it stops responding completely. Closing and reopening application does not help at all it will become slower each time till the point where even a new empty file will freeze.",
