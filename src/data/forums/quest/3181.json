      "EditableText": "Hey everyone. I just had a quick question that I'd greatly appreciate if answered. Is there a lantern script or something of the sort I can use? I'm basically just looking to find a way to use a lantern object to illuminate dark or dim rooms. Also, I've been trying several games in which combat is clearly an option, but I can't seem to figure out how to use a weapon object on an enemy. I know the method for combat probably differs for each game you play, but I don't know how to implement combat in the game yet either, so I suppose I need to know all three of these things Dx Can someone help me out? Thanks, it's much appreciated ^^",

As for combat, you need to figure out what kind of mechanics you want to use for the combat, and then implement it with scripting. If you're brand new to Quest, it's advisable to start with something a lot simpler.",
