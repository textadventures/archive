Is there a way to offer such functionality for other verbs/commands too? \r\n\r\nBTW: I am not really clear on commands vs.verbs yet. What I need (so far) is 'throw x at y' (there seems to be a command for this already) and 'bind x to y'. (All this in German in fact, but that probably doesn't make much of a difference.)",
