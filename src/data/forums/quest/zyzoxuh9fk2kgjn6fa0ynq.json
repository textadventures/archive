      "EditableText": "Hi guys. I have a few questions regarding advanced GUI customizations that don't seem to be possible using the basic interface. Any help and/or references you can provide for the following topics is appreciated.\r\n\r\n1. Moving the static picture frame to a different location. Is there a way to move the static picture from the top of the screen to the area below the compass in the side panel? There's a bunch of dead space down there that I would like to make use of.\r\n\r\n2. Can you use an image for rooms in the directional map/grid instead of specifying box color/dimensions? I was thinking about using aerial photography as an \"overhead map\" that the player jumps around on based on their location. \r\n\r\n3. Certain cosmetic GUI options are missing entirely. I can change the font and backgrounds in the text area but the side pane is always default? How can I change the background color over there?\r\n\r\n4. Menu/title fonts never seem to change. How can I match these to the text font?\r\n\r\n5. I though editing the images would be enough to change the color of the window borders but it doesn't seem to do anything. I can change the compass arrow colors this way but stuff like the window borders, text box light colors (in inventory pane for example) and command window borders remain unchanged.  Any idea how to edit these elements?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. ",

I have customized the compass a bit per your instructions in the tutorial. However, by doing so I seem to have limited the area that a background image would cover.  There is a large area right of the buttons that doesn't get filled in with the background image/color (see #1 in the reference image). The black bar covers up the rest of the image. <B>(SOLVED: Created a new row with empty spaces to push the compass area out to the border.) Looks like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<td>\r\n   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp\r\n</td>\r\n```\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n2. Inside the inventory panel I have two issues that I can't resolve. First is the highlight bar that shows when you click on an item in your inventory (see #2 in the reference image). I'm trying to change the color from orange/yellow to something that matches the object menu hover colors seen to the left. I think the ID is ui-selecting and ui-selected. <b>(UNSOLVED)</b>\r\nAlso, I'm at a lost for the scroll bar. I would like to remove it entirely or at least change the color but nothing I do seems to matter (see #3 in the reference image). I think the ID is elementListWrapper. <b>(SOLVED: Included the following line in the InitUserInterface function)\r\n```\r\nJS.eval (\"$('#inventoryWrapper').css('overflow-y', 'hidden');\")\r\n```\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n3. Finally, I would like to remove the border to the command bar. I have read other threads on the matter and even made a game with Jay's code to verify it works but when I copy the relevant code into my game the only thing I get is no more \"Type here...\" text. What's weird is it actually worked once (randomly, when it failed moments before) but reverted back to a bordered bar when I switched rooms. Also, I seem to get a \"reference to unidentified entity '&nbsp'\" error. <b>(SOLVED - kind of: I transferred my game code over to this working code piece by piece but when I transfer over my 'object' sections the game reverts to the command box border. Some sort of conflict. I've decided the border contributes to playability enough to keep it in but I would like to change both the color of the border and the color of the \"focus box\" that highlights the last element you clicked on.

I'm trying to change the color from orange/yellow to something that matches the object menu hover colors seen to the left. I think the ID is ui-selecting and ui-selected.\r\n\r\nThey do not seem to have IDs, they uses classes instead, `ui-selectee` (for all objects in the list), `uiselected` (for the selected one) and `ui-selecting` (for the selected one whilst clicked). The difference is that only one element on the page can have a specific ID but any number can have a class. In theory you can change a class by using a `.`, rather than a `#`, like the:\r\n```\r\nmsg (\"<span class=\\\"ui-selected\\\">Some text</span>\")\r\nJS.eval (\"$('.ui-selected').css('background-color', 'blue');\")\r\n```\r\nThe \"Some text\" will have a blue background... but not the selected item in the inventory. The \"Some text\" also does not change if you have the `msg` command after the `JS.eval`. I have no idea why that should be so.\r\n\r\nThe input box has an ID, `txtCommand` but again does not seem to work like the rest. And you need to alter its `outline` attribute as well as the `border` attribute.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a way around. If you go into full code view (press F9), you can add an attribute to the XL of the game object that includes CSS.\r\n```\r\n    <css><![CDATA[\r\n      <style>\r\n        #txtCommand {\r\n          outline:none;\r\n          border: none;\r\n        }\r\n        .ui-selected {\r\n          background-color: darkblue;\r\n          color: white;\r\n        }\r\n        .ui-selecting {\r\n          background-color: blue;\r\n          color: white;\r\n        }\r\n      </style>\r\n    ]]></css>\r\n```\r\nBe careful how you do that; I would suggest pasting it below this line:\r\n```\r\n    <firstpublished>2016</firstpublished>\r\n```\r\nYou can output that in game.start, and it will affect the selected item.\r\n```\r\nJS.addText (game.css)\r\n```\r\nI have only just discovered `JS.addText` but  it is the best way to output CSS and JavaScript as it is the most basic output; everything else has stuff added to it.",
