I was thinking, maybe we could all make a game together. By that I mean that one person would start a game, and would then e-mail the asl file to the next person, who would add on a little more, and so on and so on. Now there would be a few difficulties; One of them being that each person would need to know about everything; Every status variable, every flag, etc. But I'm sure we could somehow work that out. Another problem would be time: Who has time to take on another project these days? I myself am quite busy in the real world, and in my QDK world too; I'm in middle of five QDK-related projects. (I love how I referred to it as the real world and the QDK world--QDK is like it's own little world to me, what with this forum and eveything lol  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->  ) But still, I could probably put something off a while to do this. It doesn't have to be now; We could do this anytime; Whenever is best for everyone. I don't even know what the game would be about. I just thought it would be fun because we could all incorporate what we think is fun into the game. Sooooo......Ideas? Opinions?",
