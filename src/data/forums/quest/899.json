What i am working on now is a shell for an operating system, using (you guessed it) qdk. When completed (if i get that far) it's going to completely replace (visually and audio only) the windows desktop. i know this next part sounds impossible (but i already have part of it working) it will be able to be \"...accessed by both voice and keypad commands...\" I have all the graphics, and sounds needed for this task, and i have already incorporated some of the voice commands with the use of another program called game commander that i instructed quest to run. What i need from you guys are some suggestions as to what all needs to be controlled from this interface if it is going to completely (asthetically) replace the desktop.",
