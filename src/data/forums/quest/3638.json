Huzzahs and celebration commenced.  Unfortunately, my game, which had a lot of prettying up done to it, lost all that prettying up in the process.\nWell, not all of it.  The formatting of the panels on the right stayed the same, which was nice, but the background image was being overridden, somehow.\n\nAnyways, my game is in 5.4 now (that's an oops), and I was wondering how one was expected to go about using more advanced html to do things like change the panels on the side and whatnot.  For instance, in 5.3, this did what I wanted it to without overriding the background image:\n[code:11de1kmq]\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n &lt;style type = &quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\n&#46;ui-widget-header\n {\n\tfont-family&#58; Fondamento, Narkism, Times New Roman, serif;\n\tborder&#58; none;\n\tbackground&#58; transparent;\n\tcolor&#58; black;\n }  \n#txtCommand\n {\n\tfont-family&#58; Fondamento, Narkism, Times New Roman, serif;\n\tbackground-color&#58; transparent;\n\tcolor&#58; black;\n }\n &#46;ui-accordion-header\n {\n    background&#58; transparent;\n }\n &#46;ui-state-active a, &#46;ui-state-active a&#58;link, &#46;ui-state-active a&#58;visited {\n\tcolor&#58;black;\n }\n &#46;ui-state-active, &#46;ui-widget-content &#46;ui-state-active, &#46;ui-widget-header &#46;ui-state-active {\n\tborder&#58; 2px solid black;\n }\t\n &#46;ui-widget-content {\n\tborder&#58; 2px solid black;\n\tbackground&#58; transparent ;\n\tcolor&#58; #000;\n }\n &#46;ui-state-default, &#46;ui-widget-content &#46;ui-state-default, &#46;ui-widget-header &#46;ui-state-default {\n\tborder&#58; 2px solid black;\n\tbackground&#58; transparent;\n\tfont-weight&#58; bold;\n\tcolor&#58; black;\n }\n &#46;ui-state-default a, &#46;ui-state-default a&#58;link, &#46;ui-state-default a&#58;visited {\n\tcolor&#58; transparent;\n }\n div#gamePanes\n {\n    background&#58; transparent;\n }\n  &lt;/style&gt;\n &lt;/head&gt;\n &lt;/html&gt;\n[/code:11de1kmq]\n\nNow it tells me insert statements aren't supported and I should put that in a msg command.
