In the game the main character has a follower, I would like to have the follower have their own inventory. Is it possible to 1) have two inventories and 2) create a new pane on the right that shows up below the main characters inventory. (So it would show the main characters and the follower's inventories at once)\n\nI want to avoid having to switch the current player if possible.\n\n\nIve checked the forums and havent seen anything (though let me know if i missed something)",

I don't know if you've found them yet, but when running a game, go to the View menu and choose &quot;HTML Developer Tools&quot;. These are the standard Chrome tools, and you can use them to explore the HTML on the page. Check out the &quot;Elements&quot; selection.\n\nIf you do, you'll see the main Body tag has a &quot;gameBorder&quot; element under it. Under that you have elements like &quot;gamePanes&quot;, which holds all the panes on the right, and &quot;gameContent&quot;, which holds the main game content. You're going to want another pane tucked into &quot;gamePanesRunning&quot; (a child under &quot;gamePanes&quot;). \n\nSo first off, design: what do you want the right panes to look like? Will you just be adding another pane, or will you be taking some away as well? Where would you like the new pane to be?",
