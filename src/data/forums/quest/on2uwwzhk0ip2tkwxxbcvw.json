Previously I would muddle through without asking questions and accept Quest as it was, 'warts and all'. In the last couple of months you have helped make huge improvements, especially in implementing dynamic maps, game panes and hyperlinks; making maps 'display only';  and tackling some subtle Quest problems. I think you also encouraged others to get involved to help clear up issues at warp speed. You are leaving Quest in great shape so I hope you can enjoy your break with a feeling of genuine satisfaction. It's been a very productive period and, most importantly, fun all the way! Thanks!!",
