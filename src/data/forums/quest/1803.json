      "EditableText": "Thats an interesting idea as well, but what I was considering is keeping inventory for ongoing players in a chest (rather then a room) and to access their things, they can just open their chest and put them items in their inventory. This is because you cannot place 'attributes' on the multiplayer player objects. This goes along with the idea of having a room for each regular player where they keep all their items, drop them off before they log.",
