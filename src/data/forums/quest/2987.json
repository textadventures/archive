Does the game behave EXACTLY as it would online or for download when someone else plays it as it plays for me as I am creating it? The problem I am having with it, besides what I have already stated and had reported or made suggestions in the proper places, is that I have multiple endings. A lot more bad and average then good. What if I want the reader to have to restart from the beginning instead of just from the last page? As far as I know, all you have to do is use the &quot;Undo&quot; button and it undoes at least two or three pages back. What if I want a complete restart or at least from a checkpoint? Is there anyway to do that? Or would this again be a suggestion?&quot;\n\nThank you.",

That was why I had asked if there are any differences.  As far as removing the code my self... I would assume I would shut down the entire game.   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /><!-- s:lol: -->   And as far as why it is a big issue, it just seems like, well as I know now for the desktop version anyway, you can just keep clicking undo forever.  I know you can at least go back 5 clicks.  I wanted it to where if you made a mistake you have to restart or go back to a check point.  It is not meant to annoy the player, but I have a lot of pages where you lose.  If they died repeatedly and they did not know how to undo or they used undo simply to skip the story entirely just clicking through the pages until they got to the end or I should say &quot;better&quot; endings, it defeats the purpose of me making the game to begin with.  I am not saying you have to make new code, but you and who ever helps create this game may know off hand a solution, so I asked.\n\n  But as sgreig pointed out, I could simply just have a page link to restart from the beginning or to a forced check point page anyway.  I know I have them for certain things, it just never crossed my mind to do it if you made the wrong decision and lost...  <!-- s:oops: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /><!-- s:oops: -->  That still wont stop the player, but it would certainly give it more &quot;direction&quot;.

I want it to where if you made the right decisions, usually by common sense, you either got a decent ending or the best ending.  There are clues hidden through out and you may not notice them right away or never if you chose the wrong path and even still realize it until later chapters and be like OMG!!!  But yea, sorry if I am taking up your guy's time, I know you guys are busy and this is pretty trivial, but I also know how I want my story.  That is also why I had asked and then later suggested if you can add sounds into the game.  I want the player engaged in my story more than usual too.",
