      "EditableText": "I'm trying to make this short game.  The player no longer moves- when move is selected nothing happens it just says \"move east\".  when I type \"look at\" object it returns no description.  Objects have descriptions written in them to be printed when look at is typed... So I have no idea what is going on.  In teaching myself how to use this - my goal was to make an object in the laboratory in a container (called Conservatory) which can be taken and then \"switched on\" once it is in your inventory.  When it is switched on the parent is removed from your inventory and a new object is placed in your inventory.  The idea was that you are turning this object into another object.  In the game the player is meant to get a pebble and eventually turn it in to a coin using a spell which turns the switch on.  But I can't test because now it seems nothing works.\r\n\r\nAnd do I have to construct the inventory system?  I thought it was built in?  It should just be coded in that Tab brings up inventory list and inventory is an object in player.  Anyways I have a lot to learn, but I can't test anything cause it just doesn't respond in play test.  I probably did one small thing which has crashed the whole game or something.",
