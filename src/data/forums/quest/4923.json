It does show you pieces when you go to edit individual scripts, but not the entire game at once. So you can't do the copy/paste trick, sadly.\n\nWhen you say &quot;multiple devices&quot;, do you mean different sorts of devices (like iPads, etc), or are they all Windows systems? If the latter, you might be better off sharing the source with Dropbox and then just editing it in place on the different PCs with separately installed desktop versions. Dropbox will then mirror it onto all the devices automatically.",

I can access my desktop right now which is 300 miles away and start editing using my iPad if I want. Obviously there's limitations such as bandwidth and resolution differences but editing text in this way works fine. Obviously bandwidth doesn't become an issue if you're doing it on the same network.",
