Got a little problem not serious but looks awful when object is not set. What im doing is I have a day and night cycle and everything works even when game.campfire is not set problem is thou I get errors as quest is trying to find game.campfire when its not set  and fills screen with ugly errors. Here is code \r\n\r\n```\r\nIncreaseObjectCounter (player, \"Hour\")\r\nif (GetInt(player, \"Hour\") = 24) {\r\n  IncreaseObjectCounter (player, \"Days\")\r\n  player.Hour = 1\r\n}\r\nif (GetInt(player, \"Hour\") >= 17) {\r\n  SetObjectFlagOff (player, \"day\")\r\n  msg (\"its night\")\r\n  EnableTimer (Exposed)\r\n  if (not IsSwitchedOn(game.campfire)) {\r\n    if (ListContains(ScopeReachable(), game.campfire)) {\r\n      SetDark (player.parent)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    SetDark (player.parent)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (GetInt(player, \"Hour\") < 7) {\r\n  SetObjectFlagOff (player, \"day\")\r\n  msg (\"its night\")\r\n  EnableTimer (Exposed)\r\n  if (not IsSwitchedOn(game.campfire)) {\r\n    if (ListContains(ScopeReachable(), game.campfire)) {\r\n      SetDark (player.parent)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    SetDark (player.parent)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nelse if (GetInt(player, \"Hour\") >= 7) {\r\n  SetObjectFlagOn (player, \"day\")\r\n  msg (\"its day time\")\r\n  SetLight (player.parent)\r\n  DisableTimer (Exposed)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow I have a basic idea of just setting a flag and if flag is set then check but wanted to ask is there a better way or is that the best way for a quick reference? Thanks in advanced!\r\n\r\nMike",
