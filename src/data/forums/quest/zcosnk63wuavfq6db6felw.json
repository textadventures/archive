After interacting with a stack of plates, the player & Marie are moved over to a new room named 'Dining room'. I'm not entirely sure how I can alter her speech options so that the player doesn't have access to the same options they had in 'Farmhouse'. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, the player has 3 speech options when they interact with Marie in the 'Farmhouse' room. I want to give her entirely new/different speech options when in 'Dining room', then have them return to normal once the player returns to the Farmhouse (with Marie moving back to the Farmhouse too).\r\n\r\nAnyone know how to do this, or am I delving into uncharted territory so to speak?",
