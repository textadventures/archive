      "EditableText": "When I am traveling through the grid, although I have seen two different characters can end up with two different grid pictures, sometimes the grid gliches, and the yellow dot does not go into a room, but travels off the side of the screen. Are they even going into the correct rooms which they are in according to the positions of the exits? I don't think so. I think the grid is being drawn according to some other form of logic. I may be wrong. Can you keep two characters on the same map, and have the yellow dot in the correct room when players jump from one room to another due to character change?\r\n",
