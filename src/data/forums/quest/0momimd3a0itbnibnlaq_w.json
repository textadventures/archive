I don't want to give it an absolute value like 600, etc. i want it to fit the screen the user is using, is there an possible way to do this?\r\n\r\n2. Is it possible to move the map under the stats without writing a wall of code? I seen somethings when i searched for it but i don't understood a word of it, i don't know much js or css or any web based languages tbh.\r\n\r\n3. Can i make the stats appear on the opposite side of the screen?\r\n\r\n4. Is it possible to compile the game as an html file (and a folder of art assets if there are)?\r\n\r\n   Thank you very much.",

I was referring to your second question (question number 2).\r\n\r\nTo do what you're asking in questions 1 - 3, you'll have to use Javascript to manipulate the CSS.
