I want to have two different descriptions working for different flags, the player will have one flag that would give them a description, then when they get another, it change that current description. The best I have come up with is:\n\nIf \n\nplayer has flag 1 - 1st description\n\nIf\n\nplayer has flag 2 - 2nd decription\n\nThis will give both descriptions when the player has both the flag, If I can get rid of the script for 1st description when the player gets the 2nd flag. That would make it work, but I don't know it I can do that. Else if doesn't do it.\n\n2. Making menus. This one is easier, all I want to do is make a menu that gives a player a number of things to choose from. And that would effect them, like a menu saing male and female, when the player chooses either one, that would be data for a specfic attribute. Like gender. How could I do that. I had tried the tutorials and tried to find out myself for hours and got nowhere.\n\nThese are my first games and I got quite a lot of stuff down already. These problems, especially the menu problem, is the only things I need right now.",
