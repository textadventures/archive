One possible problem with menus is that there may be too many options for a nice tidy menu. The second link in my first post in this thread provides a nice overview.\n\nWith your previous help, I'm now focusing on the use of knowledge properties assigned to characters. For example, giving an NPC \"ObjectA\" can assign the NPC the property, \"knows-object_a.\" The NPC's reaction to a question about \"ObjectA\" can vary depending on whether he received it. All knowledge properties can begin with \"knows-\" to make them easy to spot in the code.\n\nI think an attitude property is another requirement. Ask someone the time of day, they will tell you if they know. Then spit on them. Then ask them for the time of day. Different response with the second request because being spit on set a proprety of \"attitude-hostile\" for the NPC.\n\nThis is better than using flags or game properties variables because the knowledge or attitude is tied to the character object. Some NPCs can have the knowledge and some may not. Plus, NPCs can \"lose\" knowledge when that helps the storyline.\n\nIt seems to me that the use of properties is key in creating believable conversations. I also think randomizing some responses and/or using counters might also help. For example, ask someone what time it is... and they answer.

I was approaching it a little differently to your suggestion though Chuck, by storing 'what there is to know' in the object and then the object a 'known by' list. You can have 'common knowledge' of specific objects this way, and more detailed knowledge only known by some NPC's, so it would seem a 'fair enough' approach. \n\nThis concept allows the 'spoon feeding' of topics to create the impression of conversation flow - which is quite nice.\n\nWhat I don't like is that this forces the repeated questioning style, which isn't natural to conversation. e.g.\n\nask Bob about Sally.\n\n\"Sally is the bartender at the Blue Dolphin Club, nice girl.\"\n\nask Bob about Blue Dolphin Club\n\n\"It's a club on Commercial Road, has karaoke nights I think.\"\n\nask Bob about karaoke\n\n\"You know, where people sing out of tune to old Frank Sinatra tracks.\"\n\n\n(The above is lifted straight from the game log of the 'test code' I ran off to do two postings ago by the way)\n\nBecause each ask and response starts a whole new sequence, you HAVE to specifiy who is being asked, but that's unnatural, the conversation would more likely go:\n\nask Bob about Sally.\n\n\"Sally is the bartender at the Blue Dolphin Club, nice girl.\"\n\nwhat's the Blue Dolphin Club?\n\n\"It's a club on Commercial Road, has karaoke nights I think.\"\n\nkaraoke nights? what are they?\n\n\"You know, where people sing out of tune to old Frank Sinatra tracks.\"\n\nO.K. so I'm being a bit unrealistic, but you get the point, once initiated a conversation tends to have an implied 'partner', you don't specify who you are asking every time.\n\nSo I think there needs to be a kind of 'conversation mode', so that once a conversation is begun, we stay in that mode and assume the questions are directed at the partner in conversation until the conclusion. This would allow much more natural exchanges.\n\nIt would also allow a 'history' of what's been asked in this conversation to be built up - which if you apply a 'tolerance' property read from the NPC might allow some NPC's to show endless patience in replying to the same question, and others to demonstrate rather less <!-- s:-) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:-) -->\n\nIt would (probably) by default also 'reset' the history (and thus tolerance) once the conversation was ended.
