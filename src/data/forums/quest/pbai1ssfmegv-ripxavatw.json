The plan is to upload it here and simultaneously release it on Steam.\r\n\r\nI noticed that on the Quest download page, they mentioned being able to package your game as an app. But I'm failing to find documentation that covers that particular process.\r\n\r\nIn short: If you wanted to make your Quest game as self-contained as possible, perhaps packaging it up as an app for Steam, what resources and documentation are available?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBill Ricardi\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit 1: Just wanted to mention where I saw the 'app' reference. It's on http://textadventures.co.uk/quest , and the line is: \"Your game can be played anywhere. In a web browser, downloaded to a PC, **or turned into an app**. Get started now for free, or find out more below.\" Thus the question. :)",

When I double click on a .quest file, it opens it in Quest, allows for saving, etc. That should at least work on PC, right?",
