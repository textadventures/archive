I'm not sure how you're implementing the buttons right now, but if they're not static pictures you might consider having the categories alternate between the different hues of blue in the Quest logo based off their current position in the stack, or perhaps completely different colors of a similar shade (although that might ruin the effect for the color blind).\nIt just feels a little messy as is, I think.
