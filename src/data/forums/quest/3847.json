I'd like to impliment a health system that shows an avatar of the player character with the background of the avatar changing colours to represent the health (probably using &quot;if&quot; statements to provoke the changes. Such as &quot;if using imageA then use imageB&quot;). \n\nI understand this can't be done in the status panel which is fine but what I'd like to figure out is how I could make this be displayed in the game window at all times? I contemplated having it just show the health when it actually changes but because of other systems I'm using, the player could really do with seeing their health at all times. Any ideas?\n\nMany thanks x",

So basically, by increment, I just mean something like this, in the function whose name you pass to Hook:<br/><br/><pre><code><br/>&lt;function name=&quot;MyKeyHook&quot; parameters=&quot;keyCode&quot;&gt;<br/>  game&#46;keycount = game&#46;keycount+1<br/>&lt;/function&gt;<br/></code></pre><br/>Just be sure to set it to 0 somewhere (like, as a default attribute value).<br/><br/>What you could do is to just let it be hooked all the time. It will just happily count keystrokes throughout the game. When you want them to start mashing, make note of the keycount:<br/><br/><pre><code>game&#46;startcount = game&#46;keycount</code></pre><br/>and then when the timer goes off, see what the difference is:<br/><br/><pre><code>keyspressed = game&#46;keycount - game&#46;startcount</code></pre><br/>Then you can do your comparisons to see if they hit enough keys.",
