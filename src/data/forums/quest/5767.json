Please let me know if this would work because I have a lot of commands to add where you can use objects on other objects in different locations.  And, of course, I already have them in the use this on other object option, but for many things I also want to give the option of alternative commands that, in many cases, make sense/seem more natural and also work.  All of my other commands I need to add are similar to this one.\n\n[code:1j16d41z]if (Got(honey)) {\n  if (Got(long thread)) {\n    msg (&quot;You drizzle the honey all over the long thread&#46;  Now you have a long sticky thread&#46;&#46;&#46; Now what?&quot;)\n    RemoveObject (honey)\n    AddToInventory (long sticky thread)\n    RemoveObject (long thread)\n  }\n  else {\n    msg (&quot;I don't see that you are carrying the long thread&#46;&quot;)\n  }\n}\nelse {\n  msg (&quot;It does not appear you are carrying the honey&#46;&quot;)\n}[/code:1j16d41z]\n\nIn addition:  does this seem like more trouble (or will cause more trouble) than it is worth?  For example, I have a landmine that the player needs to 'use on tank'.  Should I bother with these commands - &quot;put landmine under tank; hide landmine under tank; put landmine under track; etc&quot; or is relying on 'use landmine on tank' sufficient?\n\nThanks!",
