Some authoring systems, like Twine or Texture, export finished games as a single, stand-alone (barring multimedia) HTML file. Others, like Squiffy or Inform 7, export games as a mini-website made of several files, that you can still upload as a whole on textadventures.co.uk, itch.io or other similar services. But Quest has a significant server-side component that makes it non-trivial.\r\n\r\nLong story short: just distribute the Quest file, so they can download and play it offline with the Windows version of the system. You get such a download link automatically if you publish your game here.",
