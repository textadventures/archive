There isn't a huge surplus in cities of critical supplies but instead they come in as air freight, by ship, by rail, by barge, by truck, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring recent hurricane stranded citizens were shocked that FEMA doesn't have supplies to pull from but issues an order which is competitively bid upon, that transport must be arranged, etc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile panicking citizens are looting, creating chaos and disarray, mayhem, or worse. Gangs could easily control sections of urban regions with LEOs realistically trying to flee with their families. \r\n\r\nIf a pandemic was bad enough, it the Rnaught is high (how many get infectedsuccessively), and the incubation time is long before the onset of symptoms becomes recognized, then based upon fomites in contact with others or breath droplets, then you have people infecting everyone.\r\n\r\n Yeah, it's more complicated.\r\n\r\nWinter was starving time while food stores ran out, trapping impossible, often creating a defecit of calories in terms of expended ones far outweighing what calories were contained in harvested material.\r\n\r\nSure they largely had harvested acorns, but they are full of bitter tannins. Frequently river washings of buried caches would slowly leach freshly harvested ones, while older leached ones couldbe eaten, possibly were a vector for parasites, plus that method ruins a protein. The Koreans used a different method so they could produce a tofu like curd.\r\n\r\nOtherwise a major intense activity of numerous boilings requiring firewood and monitoring.\r\n\r\nSo then you have regular nuts, certain larger varieties of pine nuts.\r\n\r\nAutumn harvests of some fruit that needs a frost like perssimmon.\r\n\r\nLater as the sap rises, then collecting the maple and birch syrup, and reducing this vastly heating. \r\n\r\nThere are very few wild edibles until early spring of scant caloric value like samaras from maple trees. Then leaf lettuces and baby field greens and often sickly game animals who survived the winter....just barely.\r\n\r\nA lot of folks would have scurvy as once plagued many. Guys and nonchildbearing females can drink pine needle tea but that can cause miscarriages otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf you had covered and predug the soil then peas could go in my area...especially using a cloche to make a minigreenhouse. They would offer significant calories when they finally mature.\r\n\r\nEverything takes time to mature, and meanwhile the beans, corn, and squash takes time as summer starts. Corn and beans would be the most important for amino acid profiles being complete. When you finally harvest them, without nixtamalization then your neighbors would get pelagra.\r\n\r\nThere are more wild edibles but taking them in higher amounts creates a problem for game animals and likely is counterproductive since the risk of stealing from your garden is  more attractive versus starving.\r\n\r\nNow you are harvesting. Pumpkins quite a bit later. If you were smart you did some sucession planting to balance the workload. You were planting in the three seasons, possible extending somewhat valuable cabbage plants in cold frames.\r\n\r\nAnd what about fleeing strangers who decide to come in? And what about the farmers who realize that money has no value? Are they altruistic and feed everyone or expect trade, labor, and services?\r\n\r\nLook up the Argentine Economic Collapse in which basically they created barter clubs otherwise the entire economy shuts down.\r\n\r\nAnd should the stragglers harm the farmers' produce or livestock...or even the farmers, then all is lost.\r\n\r\nRead Forschen's One Second After where in a year of an EMP disaster...90% of the citizens die to war, mayhem, starvation, suicide, lack of medical care, infections, lack of surgery, etc.\r\n\r\nReallocating milk would be a huge chore. What is likely is people eating platefuls of some field greens that are high in nutrients and essential calcium, but then a huge uptick in kidney stones as that is a means of oxalates.\r\n\r\nLook up the After Armageddon docudrama on youtube. Lots of it is acurate except the insane drinking water from a radiator they come across as it would contain antifreeze (the desert gets cold at night seasonally) and that would kill you.",

      "HTML": "<p>JJ</p>\n<p>Do you understand Just In Time inventory controls? There isn't a huge surplus in cities of critical supplies but instead they come in as air freight, by ship, by rail, by barge, by truck, etc.</p>\n<p>During recent hurricane stranded citizens were shocked that FEMA doesn't have supplies to pull from but issues an order which is competitively bid upon, that transport must be arranged, etc.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile panicking citizens are looting, creating chaos and disarray, mayhem, or worse. Gangs could easily control sections of urban regions with LEOs realistically trying to flee with their families.</p>\n<p>If a pandemic was bad enough, it the Rnaught is high (how many get infectedsuccessively), and the incubation time is long before the onset of symptoms becomes recognized, then based upon fomites in contact with others or breath droplets, then you have people infecting everyone.</p>\n<p>Yeah, it's more complicated.</p>\n<p>Winter was starving time while food stores ran out, trapping impossible, often creating a defecit of calories in terms of expended ones far outweighing what calories were contained in harvested material.</p>\n<p>Sure they largely had harvested acorns, but they are full of bitter tannins. Frequently river washings of buried caches would slowly leach freshly harvested ones, while older leached ones couldbe eaten, possibly were a vector for parasites, plus that method ruins a protein. The Koreans used a different method so they could produce a tofu like curd.</p>\n<p>Otherwise a major intense activity of numerous boilings requiring firewood and monitoring.</p>\n<p>So then you have regular nuts, certain larger varieties of pine nuts.</p>\n<p>Autumn harvests of some fruit that needs a frost like perssimmon.</p>\n<p>Later as the sap rises, then collecting the maple and birch syrup, and reducing this vastly heating.</p>\n<p>There are very few wild edibles until early spring of scant caloric value like samaras from maple trees. Then leaf lettuces and baby field greens and often sickly game animals who survived the winter....just barely.</p>\n<p>A lot of folks would have scurvy as once plagued many. Guys and nonchildbearing females can drink pine needle tea but that can cause miscarriages otherwise.</p>\n<p>If you had covered and predug the soil then peas could go in my area...especially using a cloche to make a minigreenhouse. They would offer significant calories when they finally mature.</p>\n<p>Everything takes time to mature, and meanwhile the beans, corn, and squash takes time as summer starts. Corn and beans would be the most important for amino acid profiles being complete. When you finally harvest them, without nixtamalization then your neighbors would get pelagra.</p>\n<p>There are more wild edibles but taking them in higher amounts creates a problem for game animals and likely is counterproductive since the risk of stealing from your garden is  more attractive versus starving.</p>\n<p>Now you are harvesting. Pumpkins quite a bit later. If you were smart you did some sucession planting to balance the workload. You were planting in the three seasons, possible extending somewhat valuable cabbage plants in cold frames.</p>\n<p>And what about fleeing strangers who decide to come in? And what about the farmers who realize that money has no value? Are they altruistic and feed everyone or expect trade, labor, and services?</p>\n<p>Look up the Argentine Economic Collapse in which basically they created barter clubs otherwise the entire economy shuts down.</p>\n<p>And should the stragglers harm the farmers' produce or livestock...or even the farmers, then all is lost.</p>\n<p>Read Forschen's One Second After where in a year of an EMP disaster...90% of the citizens die to war, mayhem, starvation, suicide, lack of medical care, infections, lack of surgery, etc.</p>\n<p>Reallocating milk would be a huge chore. What is likely is people eating platefuls of some field greens that are high in nutrients and essential calcium, but then a huge uptick in kidney stones as that is a means of oxalates.</p>\n<p>Look up the After Armageddon docudrama on youtube. Lots of it is acurate except the insane drinking water from a radiator they come across as it would contain antifreeze (the desert gets cold at night seasonally) and that would kill you.</p>\n\n",
