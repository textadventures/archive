One is normal and one is magical.\n\nI want the normal light source to work in every dark room [i:2pm9yjlw]except[/i:2pm9yjlw] one, which has a magical darkness.  For that room, you need another light source which is magical.\n\nSo, I don't want the normal light source to work in that one room.\n\nNow, the way I did this was have all the rooms checked as initially Dark for the normal light.  Simple enough.\n\nHowever, with the other room I'm having a slightly more difficult time.  I had to create two room descriptions for that room.  One says that if the [i:2pm9yjlw]Player Is Not Carrying Magical Light[/i:2pm9yjlw] then it says the room is pitch black and I made all objects Invisible.  The other has if the [i:2pm9yjlw]Player Is Carrying Magical Light[/i:2pm9yjlw] then the room has the normal description.\n\nFor the record, I making the normal lamp say the room is Dark if brought in but that doesn't seem to work.\n\nAny easier way around this the best route to go?  If anyone with GUI knowledge has an easier work around, I'm open to ideas. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nAlso, other question not related to making game....\n\nIs there a way to disable autosaving?  It seems like I can make changes and not save but yet when I exit, it doesn't give me the warning prompt and I notice it saved my work when I didn't want it to (for example, making a mistake).  So, I'm guessing Quest 5.5 autosaves sometimes.  That's a good feature but is there anyway to stop it from doing that?",
