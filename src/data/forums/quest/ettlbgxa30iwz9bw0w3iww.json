E.g. If the object is a cupboard. You need to create the \"illusion\" of climbing the cupboard by having a location called \"on top of the cupboard\". Then if you want to go further e.g. You can open a trapdoor in the roof above and exit up to the loft (another location). \r\n\r\nTo keep the logic in this scenario, you will have to list trap door in room that cupboard is in, but in that room, you cannot open it as you cannot reach it...yet. \r\n\r\nThough objects allow you to have a surface, sometimes it is best to remove that option and make a new location instead, to fool the player that they have climbed the object and are actually on top of it. Otherwise, you won't be able to jump from top of an object you have allowed to have a climbable surface to a higher place, if you get my meaning.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.",
