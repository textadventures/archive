My group is having a bit of a problem with our class project and we're trying to make our game awesome!\n\nOur game is called Master Chef and the storyline is that the player has to gather multiple ingredients to create different courses of meals. In one of the rooms, the player has to use a backscratcher to retrieve the scallops needed for the meal. We want to make it so the player has to have the backscratcher in order to get the scallops and if they don't pick up the backscratcher, they can't pick up the scallops. Does anyone know how to make this happen in the game? \n\nThanks!",

Alternatively, you could modify the core DoTake function, but that gets really complicated.
