I'm just wondering if anyone has either created/attempted to create a non-random combat system, or ever encountered such a system in their IF wanderings.\n\nBy non-random I mean fore-going the use of the Rand function.  0 probabilities come into play.  The comparison of statistics, however, is still present.  This means that combat outcomes would always be the same for each static set of statistics.  (Note that combat descriptions could still be randomized.)  Combat such as this seems to be closer to what the IF community would deem acceptable to this story medium.\n\nHow could one go about making a non-random combat system complex enough without probability...?",

Dodge left.\n2. Dodge right.\n3. Swing your sword at his foot.\n4. Lunge your sword at his belly.\n5. Swing your sword at his axe.\n6. Etc, etc.\n(Here I was going to have a bunch of different choices for this aspect of the scenario, but as mentioned before it's author choice to perhaps have the player need to figure out the proper verbage and such, but I also left the same choices to show that you could perhaps have the same manuevers possible each step of the scenario and require the player to figure out the right order. Next I'll illustrate both an example of first the right choice ending the scenario and a wrong choice which could loop back to the beginning, or decrease a score or amount of chances to solve the scenario, or whatever you want.)\n\n==============\nPOSITIVE SCENARIO\n==============\n\n&gt;5\n\n[i:1gankur9]You heave your sword at the vikings massive axe as he toils to remove it from it's place firmly embedded in the soil and land a successful hit breaking the weapon in two. Now a useless handle occupies  the embarassed Norseman's hands and the deadly axe head is left useless stuck in the ground.[/i:1gankur9]\n\n[b:1gankur9]&quot;Please take mercy upon me, clearly a warrior of your caliber would spare the life of a foolish old sailor.&quot;[/b:1gankur9] The viking begs of you. [b:1gankur9]&quot;Please take this *OMG-LEWT* and continue upon your journey.&quot;[/b:1gankur9]\n\n[i:1gankur9]You got the *OMG-LEWT*!11oneleven.[/i:1gankur9]\n\n==============\nNEGATIVE SCENARIO\n==============\n\n&gt;3\n\n[i:1gankur9]You swing your sword at the vikings foot as he toils to lift his stuck axe, and just before your blade strikes, he dislodges his weapon and parries your blow leaving you off balanced. Spotting your weakness, the rotund northerner slams into with his massive belly knocking you to the ground.[/i:1gankur9]\n\nYou quickly scramble to your feet but realize you shouldn't allow yourself to make that mistake again.\n\n(You could then loop back into the viking attacking the same way from the beginning, letting the player fight again make the right choices up untill this point and then try a better option when the blade gets stuck, or you could continue along a scripted fight, deduct a point from the player, and judge his overall winning of the fight based on some factor of that.)\n\n\nI hope that is a good example of what I was saying and all of that all of my jabbering wasn't too hard to understand. I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but as I said you don't have to give choices, just leave it to the player to figure out the verbage, or prompt for an action every step of the way even having a counter to institute a feeling of urgency. Maybe if I have some time tonight I'll make a demo or three of how a fight like this could go down and try to post on it. Either way, I hope the example promotes more discussion of the topic.",
