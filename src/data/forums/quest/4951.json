So a workaround is to set all the verbs up individually and then copy the code across but the game isn't letting me do that either for some bizarre reason. I'm trying to use the verb push and add aliases shove and move. I add the code to the new verb and then test the game and it doesn't work. When I go back to look at the script the game has simply disregarded (deleted) it. Is there a simple way of doing this?",

The verb object itself, like that above, and the script on another object. The script on the other object is on the &quot;rotate&quot; attribute in this example, but that is really just a name for Quest; the player never sees it.\n\nThe aliases go into the verb object, and as Quest quietly creates these for you it is easy to miss they even exist. Look for them under the game object. Many are built-in too.",
