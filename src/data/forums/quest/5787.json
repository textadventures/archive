Unfortunately, it now appears to have disappeared, not only in every new game I make but all the previous projects too. Any idea why, and how to get it back? I can change the wording of it via a Request, but I can't get it to show up... I just want that friendly little button back!",

If I turn it off from the beginning or hide it, goodbye Continue Label. If it's on, Continue Label appears as intended. \n\nNow, I can work around that quite easily - chuck in a request to show the command bar before each wait, and hide it immediately afterwards. That's going to get pretty annoying pretty fast, though... so is there anything else I can do to separate these two features?",
