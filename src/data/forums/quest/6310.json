Some feature I need to check?[/quote:755s9dgm]\n\nI'll try to help a little. So basically you're using &quot;visited&quot; like a &quot;flag&quot;. For example, [i:755s9dgm]kitchen.visited=True[/i:755s9dgm] or [i:755s9dgm]kitchen.visited=False[/i:755s9dgm]. Right?\n\n1. I would say go to your Kitchen's [i:755s9dgm]Attributes Tab[/i:755s9dgm]\n2. Click &quot;Add&quot;\n3. visited (Boolean) unchecked (making it False)\n4. Then go to [i:755s9dgm]Script Tab[/i:755s9dgm] of the room, find the &quot;After Entering&quot; or &quot;Before Entering&quot; whichever you prefer (before might work better). \n5. Add a &quot;Script&quot;, &quot;Set variable or attribute&quot; then write [i:755s9dgm]kitchen.visited=True[/i:755s9dgm]\n\nMake sure that everything matches up. That's really important in Quest. \nFor example, your room-name is kitchen. So Kitchen.Visited (will cause errors), KITCHEN.visited (will cause errors), Kitchen.visited (will cause errors). If you write the name in lower case, every time you use it, it must be lower-case. Same goes for the attribute, visited. Also, make sure True and False are capitalized, otherwise they may not work in some instances. \n\nI hope this helps to solve your problem, make sure you delete your old code that was causing the errors in the first place!",
