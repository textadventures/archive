The problem is that quest shows the room description 2 times. And I think my solution is not correct. I tried to return false in the &quot;before enter room script&quot;, but it does not work. Any tips?\n\nThanks",

Then have the exit unlock when the player has achieved the necessary condition. Obviously there should be a guard object in the room as well so the player isn't confused when a guard is mentioned but there's none in the room.",
