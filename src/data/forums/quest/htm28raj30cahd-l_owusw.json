The result I'm looking for is that the player can look at the watch and see the time in the description.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I have a timer with an interval of '1' and a script that should set a variable 'watchtimer' to the value of the timer.\r\nThen, when you look at the watch, it will use that variable to display the time.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I found is that when I try to assign the variable to anything using the timer (which starts when the game begins for now), even if it's an integer, it will run an error saying that the variable 'watchtimer' is unknown. The spelling and capitalization is consistent throughout.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to make this work?\r\nThanks!",

I've gotten everything working now.\r\n\r\nSolution: I had to set ```game.count```, which stores the watch's timer value, to ```game.count + 1``` in the timer script so it would increase by 1 every second to create a value for the timer that can be printed.\r\n\r\nNot sure if there's an easier way to do that (e.g. being able to print the timer's value without making a new attribute), but that worked for me.",
