      "EditableText": "Hi guys,\n\nIt's me again - bright eyed and bushy tailed - and fairly clueless.\n\nIs there a simple way to make a picture display in the quest game side by side with another picture at the same time?\n\nSo, I have a minigame/puzzle where the player must shift reactor fuel rods into their housing. The housing is the three-sided square closest to each rod.\n\nEach rod is assigned a name based on its location. The left set of rods are in column A. The right, in column B. The rod on the top is 1A or 1B. The rod on the bottom is 5A or 5B.\n\nTo shift a rod, the player will need to type, &quot;Shift 1A&quot; etc. Except, there's a problem. Shifting a rod in the A column causes the adjacent rod in the B column to shift as well. Shifting a rod in the B column causes the rod directly below it in the same column to shift.\n\nI originally imagined how I would code it making a series of 6 pictures displayed in succession to build the following image. There would be a title and directions picture, and then 1A and 1B would be displayed simultaneously, then 2A and 2B below it. Except, this would make the amount of coding I need to put in insane. I was wondering if I can separate this diagram so that each rod and its housing is displayed in a separate picture. But I still want rods in column A to be displayed next to their counterparts in column B.\n\nThe ending diagram would look like this when displayed in Quest, but the diagram is actually going to be a series of pictures all displayed at the same time to look like this...\n\n[img:2hm3a5zc]http&#58;//img26&#46;imageshack&#46;us/img26/1364/rodalignment1&#46;png[/img:2hm3a5zc]\n\nSo, I may not have described my issue as articulately as possible. If you don't understand my issue, here are some more pictures to display my problem.\n\nThis is what currently happens when I try to separate each rod into a separate image file, and then display it in quest...\n[img:2hm3a5zc]http&#58;//imageshack&#46;us/a/img69/42/examplerod2&#46;png[/img:2hm3a5zc]\n\nThis is what I want quest to display.
