Else: decrease health by a larger amount.</blockquote><br/><br/>Well yeah, but the armour and weapons are completely negligible if I can't figure out how to cause this damage in the first place. My point is that the help I've recieved thus far is a little complicated and I can't make heads nor tails of it.<br/><br/>Here's my problem.<br/><br/>I think it might be the autism talking, that or the fact I'm just an idiot. But everything I see that I don't fully understand usually has to get listed in the format of &quot;This goes here and this goes here to make this work.&quot; or else I completely stall.<br/>So yeah. All of this stuff looks good, and I really think the dicerolling bit would be most effective if it isn't too complicated when it comes to said format of explanation, but please could you guys put it down like that for me? I'm sorry if I seem a little unreasonable.",
