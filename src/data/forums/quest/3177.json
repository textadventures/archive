      "EditableText": "Hey guys, real speedy question here. How would I create a door that requires two parameters to unlock?\n\nHere's the scenario: I have a room (D5 Door Gate) that has a locked exit (D5_Door) to a second room (D5 Entrance Corridor).\nThe player needs to swipe two keycards (Access Cards 1 and 2, respectively) into their respective readers (Readers 1 and 2, respectively). That then opens the door.\n\nNow, what I have now is a script that goes like this (sorry about not posting the actual core script; I don't know how to get it from the editor):\n[code:3dslyvtw]Use (Access Card 1) on (Reader 1)\nPrint &quot;You swipe the card, and a light on the machine turns green&#46;&quot; / Switch on dummy_gate_1[/code:3dslyvtw]\n\n[code:3dslyvtw]Use (Access Card 2) on (Reader 2)\nPrint &quot;You swipe the card, and a light on the machine turns green&#46;&quot; / Switch on summy_gate_2[/code:3dslyvtw]\n\n[code:3dslyvtw]After switching on dummy_gate_1\nIf&#58; Object is switched on (object&#58; dummy_gate_1)\nThen&#58;\nIf&#58; Object is switched on (object&#58; dummy_gate_2)\nThen&#58;\nPrint &quot;The door slowly rises&#46;&quot;\nUnlock exit (exit&#58; D5_door)[/code:3dslyvtw]\n\nThe reason I used the objects dummy_gate_1 and _2 (Invisible objects) is because I don't want crafty players bypassing the key card hunt by just saying &quot;switch on Reader 1.&quot; There's probably a way to fix that, which would be nice to know.\n\nAlso, by using the two &quot;If&quot; scripts in a row, I was basically trying to make an &quot;and&quot; gate. Is there a way to do this that works?\nCheers, guys!",
