I don't really know how to use the scripts all that well.\r\n\r\nSo I'm trying to make it so that when the player clicks on a link, it'll show the text from the page that it's linking to so that the player can move forwards in the game. However, when I tested the game, when I click on the link it just shows the text from the first page instead of from the page it's supposed to show. How do I fix this?",
