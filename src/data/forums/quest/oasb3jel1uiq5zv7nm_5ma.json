      "EditableText": "I asked about this, along with some other questions, on another thread, but I'm now starting a new one specifically for my sound-related questions, since I am still having difficulty.\r\n\r\nFirst, I have a door that opens to reveal an exit, then closes to hide that exit. I want a sound to play when the door is opened, and another sound to play when it is closed. As of right now, the sound plays when the door is opened, just like I want it to, but I get nothing when it's closed.\r\n\r\nHere is what my code looks like. Maybe I have things in the wrong order, or something is missing?\r\n\r\nHelperOpenObject (metal door)\r\nplay sound (\"open_metal_fence_gate.mp3\", false, false)\r\nMakeExitVisible (Exit to Warehouse)\r\n\r\nplay sound (\"close_metal_fence_gate.mp3\", false, false)\r\nMakeExitInvisible (Exit to Warehouse)\r\nHelperCloseObject (metal door)\r\n\r\nSecond, I want to do the same thing as above, but on the opposite side of the exit. In other words, I have a door object in the next room that I also want to open and close and play sounds, because I want to give the player the impression that they are now dealing with the same door, just on the other side of it, in the next room. I'm not sure that is a very clear explanation, so please ask if you're not following.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that doesn't work at all. The door does nothing whatsoever, and I don't know why, because I set it up exactly the same way as the first openable/closable door object.\r\n\r\nThird, one of the locations in my game is a nightclub, so I want music to play when the player is in that room. I wasn't quite sure on how to set this up, so I took a guess, and it didn't work. I chose to run a script for the room description, added an \"if\" command, selected \"player is in room\" for the expression, chose \"play a sound\" and uploaded my .mp3 file, then printed a message to describe the room. Clearly that wasn't the way to do it, but hey, I tried.\r\n\r\nAny help with any of these three issues would be very much appreciated, and I thank you in advance.\r\n",
