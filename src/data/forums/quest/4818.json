However, everything after that will happen straightaway, so the player sees the messages in the last two lines at once.\n\nThe script checks if the player is still in the room (which was called room5 in my test; you cannot use &quot;this&quot; within the SetTimeout script), and if she is, she gets shot.\n\n\n\nWhere d'you think you're going?\n\nThis sounds like it should be on the exit (the one the player came through, I guess). I would put a Boolean attribute on the exit from the room called &quot;blocked&quot;, then on the Exit tab, tick the &quot;Run a script&quot; box. The script could be:\n\n[code:3k9ehpbh]if (this&#46;blocked) {\n  msg (&quot;\\&quot;Whooa!!\\&quot; Tom jumps from his chair and grabs you by the chest&#46; \\&quot;Where d'you think you're going?
