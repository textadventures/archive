      "EditableText": "Greetings! My name is Luce and i'm new here and new to Quest, only been using it for just about 24 hours now. I've had previous game engine experience in GameMaker: Studio so I picked this up quite quickly but obviously it's a learning process.\n\nI'm making my first text adventure game as a sort of small demo of an idea I have and right off the bat there is a patrolling enemy. The enemy is in a hallway that is separated into four rooms. Hallway 1, Hallway 2, Hallway 3 and Hallway 4. The player enters the hallway at Hallway 3 which triggers a timer script for the guard at Hallway 1. Every 10 seconds he will move east down the hall. I have that working all fine and dandy. But my issue is getting him to turn round at the end of the hallway and go back.\n\nSo far I put an attribute on the guard called &quot;dirright&quot; set to boolean and true. The code detects if the guard has arrived at Hallway 4 and then if dirright is true it sets it to false.\n\nWhen I run this I get this error:\n[quote:xdt4bpug]Error running script&#058; Error compiling expression 'dirright': Unknown object or variable 'dirright'[/quote:xdt4bpug]\n\nI cannot for the life of me figure out what is wrong. I tried changing the attribute to Integer and to swap between 1 and 0 but it still gets the same error. Any ideas here? Thanks in advance!!",
