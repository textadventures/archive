Like, the command list is too big to scroll through and I only know it's going to get worse as I continue to make the game. I was wondering if I could make folders to put commands in to separate them. Whenever I tried, however, the commands don't work in-game. Any solutions?\n\nAnd thanks. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
