Either I REALLY don't know what I am doing or just don't know how to read. I am trying to do some things and can't seem to make it work.\n\nI want to create a room. Have a rug on the floor. MOVE the rug to reveal a hatch (unseen before I move rug).  OPEN (and close) hatch to move to the next room.\n\nFrom the next room, CLOSE (and open) hatch before I can move back to the original room.\n\nAny help (the more precise the better) would be greatly appreciated.\nBill",
