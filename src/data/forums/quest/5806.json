Maybe I'm using the wrong search words, but I thought I'd just ask the community.\n\nAs support for one of my tabletop games, I want to build a menu system that my players can look through to buy items from.  Once a PC buys and item, I want it to show up in the Inventory.  That's all super-simple.\n\nThe problem is that they may want more than one instance of an item, and each item may have different attributes.  This means that I'd want to rename each cloned item as they come up.  I know that the first clone is named, say, item1, second item2...\n\nHowever, I want each cloned item to be named with a corresponding number, for example: &quot;1: Item.  2: Item.&quot;  The reason being that I want the PCs to quickly be able to identify, look at and potentially sell back any items they don't want.  I can create a counter easily enough, but I can't manage to change the name or listalias with, say, a {player.count} attribute built into the name; it just won't let me.\n\nIs there any way that I can rename cloned items in a sequential manner, so that they can be quickly differentiated from each other?\n\nMany thanks.",
