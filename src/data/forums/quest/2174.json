      "EditableText": "Problem: When buttons are clicked on, they don't respond the 1st time.\n\nTo replicate:\n1) Start a new game\n2) Click the &quot;Create Room&quot; button on the toolbar\n2) Name the room anything, then try to click on the &quot;OK&quot; button in the dialog.\n\nIn my case, the 1st click on the button is ignored. Weird. This seems to affect all buttons in the QDK Pro 4.1, but not the EXE that actually runs the adventure. Furthermore, if the button is the default or cancel button for a window (or dialog), the key-equivalent (&lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Esc&gt;, respectively) [u:2qtd2208]does[/u:2qtd2208] trigger the button's action the 1st time.\n\nNote that only &quot;normal&quot; Windows(tm) buttons are affected, not toolbar buttons, nor any other UI element.\n\nThis did not happen in QDK Pro 4.0. Not sure about any other releases.",
