I have created a &quot;sub-object&quot; - the arms - defining the signpost as the parent object, as well as four separate objects for the north, south, east and west arms, also defining the signpost as the parent object.\n\nWhen I play the game I can see the signpost and examine it, but when I try to examine the arms or the individual arms I get &quot;I can't see that!&quot;\n\nWhat have I done wrong.\n\nGame file attached.\n\nThanks.",
