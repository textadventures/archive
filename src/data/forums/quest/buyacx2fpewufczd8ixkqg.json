I have some coding where I want something to happen before they enter the room, which includes text and functions displaying text. So it displays all the text and when they enter the room, the room name appears after all that text. So I was hoping to disable the printing of the room name and just print it manually in the Before you enter Room area.",

To enable it again, set it to a number from 1 to 4.\r\n* If you want to postpone changing the room name in the location bar, it'll require some javascripty oddness. If so, let me know and I'll give it a try.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!",
