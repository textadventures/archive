I did essentially the same thing as my previous post.  I added a turn counter that reset at 4.  I added a script dictionary and named it RandomPatrol.  The keys were numbered 1-x (x being the number of room you want patrolled).  The scripts were copy-paste bits moving the patrolling NPC to a room (just got to change the room)  I also added in this script if the patroller was moved into a room that contained the player, a message indicating that was printed..  On count three, I ran that complicated bit:\n[code:10xkgall]if (Patroller Random&#46;PatrolCount2 = 3) {\n          n = ToString (GetRandomInt (1, DictionaryCount (Patroller Random&#46;RandomPatrol)))\n          m = ScriptDictionaryItem(Patroller Random&#46;RandomPatrol, n)\n          invoke (m)\n        }[/code:10xkgall]\nto call the script dictionary at random.  It may seem like a lot when you have a bunch of rooms, but once you get the copy-paste-change that bit for each of the items in the script dictionary, it goes VERY fast.  A few minutes and you can do 50 rooms pretty easy (once you get the hang of it).\n\nIf you need help with a further explanation, let me know.",

It's separate because I joined both of these examples in the same file.<br/><pre><code>  &lt;turnscript name=&quot;Patroller TS&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;enabled /&gt;<br/>    &lt;script&gt;<br/>      Patroller&#46;PatrolCount = Patroller&#46;PatrolCount +1<br/>      Patroller Random&#46;PatrolCount2 = Patroller Random&#46;PatrolCount2 +1<br/>    &lt;/script&gt;<br/>  &lt;/turnscript&gt;</code></pre><br/><br/>Here is the .aslx file with both of them together if that makes it easier to understand.<div><a href=\"/forumattachments/1575/Patrolling Test.aslx\">Patrolling Test.aslx</a></div><br/><br/>To save myself (and likely you) from further descriptions... I did essentially the same thing as my previous post.  I added a turn counter that reset at 4.  I added a script dictionary and named it RandomPatrol.  The keys were numbered 1-x (x being the number of room you want patrolled).  The scripts were copy-paste bits moving the patrolling NPC to a room (just got to change the room)  I also added in this script if the patroller was moved into a room that contained the player, a message indicating that was printed..  On count three, I ran that complicated bit:<br/><pre><code>if (Patroller Random&#46;PatrolCount2 = 3) {<br/>          n = ToString (GetRandomInt (1, DictionaryCount (Patroller Random&#46;RandomPatrol)))<br/>          m = ScriptDictionaryItem(Patroller Random&#46;RandomPatrol, n)<br/>          invoke (m)<br/>        }</code></pre><br/>to call the script dictionary at random.  It may seem like a lot when you have a bunch of rooms, but once you get the copy-paste-change that bit for each of the items in the script dictionary, it goes VERY fast.  A few minutes and you can do 50 rooms pretty easy (once you get the hang of it).<br/><br/>If you need help with a further explanation, let me know.",
