I'm hoping for it to be mostly character-driven, with lots of dialogue (branching and otherwise), so I downloaded the ConvLib library to help with that. So far, I've managed to do everything I've needed with it, and it definitely seems useful. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nOne thing I was wondering, though, is whether it's possible to have certain conversation topics only appear on the menu after the player has completed certain actions, or perhaps if they have a certain item, or have fulfilled some other condition. So far, the only condition I can find for topics appearing is if a previous topic has been chosen, which causes a new one to replace it in the menu. (I'd want to do this in the GUI, if possible - I have very little experience with coding, unfortunately. Also, I'm sorry if this has already been posted.)",

Then, I used an 'If' statement for that topic to get the desired response.  Again, if you can follow Pixie's advice, do that.  If not, use this.  It was quite easy.  Ask if you have questions.<br/><br/>Good luck.<br/><br/>XanMag",
