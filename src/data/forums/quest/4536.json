I'm not certain, but it seems as if, in each case, this happens just before encountering a sound file. These games both worked perfectly prior to late March.\nBoth these games were written with Quest v.5.4\nMight this be a compatability problem with v.5.5? Have there been any other reports of similar effects?",
