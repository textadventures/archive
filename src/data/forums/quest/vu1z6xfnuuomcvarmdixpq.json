It's my first time using Quest and C#, but I do have coding experience with HTML and Ruby.\r\n\r\nI'm making a murder mystery text adventure, and I want to add a custom command that can define a term, as I'm aware that forensic terms like \"lividity\" aren't as well-known as others.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the player types \"define lividity\" in the text bar at any time, I want to be able to come back with a message saying, \"Lividity is a discoloration that occurs when blood stops moving and pools in the lowest point of the body.\" Or if the player types \"define postmortem\" they will get a message saying \"Postmortem means after death. It can also refer to the body's autopsy.\"\r\n\r\nMy question is, what is the coding to set up the command \"define\"? From my understanding, after I get that set up I can use \"define #text#\" and specify \"text\" as each vocabulary word. If that's incorrect, though, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!",
