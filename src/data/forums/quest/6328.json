IE I have made a mistake, or wish to add another option with a semicolon, the verb cannot be changed. Even if I delete it and re enter it, it still comes back as it was before, and this applies even if it is used with another object. I find this frustrating , as I have messed up a verb I need to use. I realise I could enter it as a command, but commands can get complicated if you not only have to enter all the verb options and the ob jet(which may have more than one name)they apply to",
