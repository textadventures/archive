Does that make sense?\n\nI created an object type (with QDK) of Drinkable.  But I don't understand the part in the help guide describing Actions (where exactly to put what).\n\nI found a sample game in the downloads that references a drinking glass being emptied.  I'll read that and try to figure out how to deplete the water from the canteen.  But, if anyone wants to just show me...\n\nThanks in advance for the advice.  I am reading the references as I go, and I don't plan to ask newbie questions forever.  But, I really do *appreciate* the jumpstart!\n\nAlf",
