I was going through the very first tutorial and got to the part where you add verbs to an object. I have a tv set in the lounge that has a crack in it. I want the player to be able to try to watch the tv. The message I want to follow is &quot;nothing happens&quot;. So I selected Print a message after I have added the verb to the tv object. When I play the game however and type &quot;watch tv&quot; it just gives me a blank line as if I hadn't written anything. I don't know if this is a beginner problem and if I missed something in the tutorial or if I am missing something obvious in the verbs menu.I have also added the game file to this post.\n\nHere is a link to the tutorial in case anyone wants to see it.
