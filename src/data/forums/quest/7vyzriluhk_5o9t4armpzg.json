I don't mind it asking me which object, but I don't want the hyperlinks as they don't appear anywhere else in the game (I've disabled hyperlinks in the game settings) so they are incongruous here.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a template in the library somewhere, but I can't figure out which one...",

      "EditableText": "Unfortunately, it's not so easy. The disambiguation menu uses `ShowMenu`, which includes the line:\r\n```\r\nmsg (count + \": <a class=\\\"cmdlink\\\" style=\\\"\" + style + \"\\\" onclick=\\\"ASLEvent('ShowMenuResponse','\" + EscapeQuotes(optiontag) + \"')\\\">\" + optionText + \"</a>\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the desktop version of Quest, you could modify that line. Possibly replace it with something like:\r\n```\r\nmsg (count + \": \" + optionText)\r\n```\r\n(although it might also be helpful to let players know that they can type the number to make a choice, so they don't feel like they've got to type long object names in full)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nIf you're on the web editor, or you don't want to modify the core functions, you could use javascript instead; removing the hyperlinks before showing them to the player.\r\n\r\nThis line of javascript will remove the hyperlinks from a menu that is currently on the screen:\r\n```\r\n$('#divOutput .cmdlink').removeClass('cmdlink').removeAttr('onclick');\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you could do:\r\n```\r\nShowMenu (\"Type a number to pick your favourite colour\", Split(\"red;green;blue\"), true) {\r\n  msg (\"You picked: \"+result)\r\n}\r\nJS.eval(\"$('#divOutput .cmdlink').removeClass('cmdlink').removeAttr('onclick');\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the case of the disambiguation menu, the only script running is the parser itself. So you'd need to get a piece of javascript to run whenever a menu is output. To avoid running the script every turn (which could end up slowing the game down if there's a lot of output for it to process), I'd suggest making it run only at the end of a section. (menus are always put into their own section so that Quest can hide them after you made a choice).\r\n\r\nYou could do:\r\n```\r\nvar original_EndOutputSection = EndOutputSection;\r\nEndOutputSection = function (name) {\r\n  getCurrentDiv().find('.cmdlink').removeClass('cmdlink').removeAttr('onclick');\r\n  original_EndOutputSection(name);\r\n};\r\n```\r\nWhich basically replaces the function `EndOutputSection` with one which removes all hyperlinks from the current section before calling the original function to end it.\r\n\r\nOr, shrunk down so it's easier to include in Quest:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(function () {\r\n  var i=EndOutputSection;\r\n  EndOutputSection = j => getCurrentDiv().find('.cmdlink').removeClass('cmdlink').removeAttr('onclick') && i(j)\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TL,DR:**\r\n You can put the following line in your UI Initialisation script (On the game's \"Advanced Scripts\" tab, after you enabled it on the \"Features\" tab):\r\n```\r\nJS.eval (\"$(function () {var i=EndOutputSection;EndOutputSection=j=>getCurrentDiv().find('.cmdlink').removeClass('cmdlink').removeAttr('onclick') && i(j)})\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note: This will remove the underline from links, and cause them to not respond when clicked on, but it won't change the colour because that's set manually for each link. Easier to set the link colour to be the same as your normal text colour)",
