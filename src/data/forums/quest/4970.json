I won't go through all the steps I went through, but here's what I ended up with. You can pass a function to &quot;wait&quot; instead of an inline script. (For some reason, it wants a function instead of a script. So you can't pass either a script attribute or script variable.) This allows you to &quot;spread the pain&quot; a bit by at least not having to nest.<br/><br/>The entire game is here:<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;5&#46;5328&#46;26617--&gt;<br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;scriptwaittest&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;8549b59d-daa8-4686-bb38-f550a399426d&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2015&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>    &lt;start type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>      msg (&quot;You enter the room&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;)<br/>      wait part2<br/>    &lt;/start&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;function name=&quot;part2&quot;<br/>\t  msg (&quot;The monster attacks&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;)<br/>\t  wait part3<br/>  &lt;/function&gt;<br/>  &lt;function name=&quot;part3&quot;&gt;<br/>\t  msg (&quot;And you die&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;)<br/>  &lt;/function&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre><br/>The key parts are this...
