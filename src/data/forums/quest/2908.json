When the light is switched on I've set a script to unlock the exit, yet it remains locked. I've taken a screen shot of my setup for the script. I wonder if this has something to do with the hierarchy of my tree on the left? Surely the switch has to be an object of the wall. The wall is a surface. The light can switch on and off and when you look, the description for light on or light off is correct, so why won't the exit unlock when the light is switched on?\n\n[img:3u3i6i12]http&#58;//dl&#46;dropbox&#46;com/u/25233603/temp/quest4&#46;gif[/img:3u3i6i12]",
