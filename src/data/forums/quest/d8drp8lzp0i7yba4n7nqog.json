I think that I have to use inherited type attributes for each room that the NPC will retreat from, right?

Let's pretend instead of a kitten object it is an inherited type attribute called 'fear'.  \r\n\r\nI realize I could do a bunch of Else Ifs and check for each object in those certain rooms, but that seems like a mess.\r\n\r\nThanks again!",
