Before I really start using this marvelous textadventure development tool, I like to know whether it is possible to save the scores and names of the players to an external file, and turn this into a scoreboard, which can again be called for and shown in the game.\nSo, basically I'm asking whether it is possible to read and write to an external file? In a fairly easy way?\nThis question might have been asked before, but I could not find a straight answer. \nThanks in advance!",
