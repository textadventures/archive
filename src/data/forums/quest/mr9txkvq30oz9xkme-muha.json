I'm still getting used to everything, but one thing I really can't figure out is this: how do I use a Health function in a Gamebook?\r\n\r\nThis is probably a hilariously simple and/or stupid question, but still, I've tried what I could think of, and can't seem to figure anything out. Where would I set up the Health counter? And what type of code would I need to use alongside it? Thanks in advance.",
