If you can't take something in the first place then in most cases whether drop is set or not is irrelevant. So drop is checked by default because again in most cases, once you do set an object to be able to be taken you'll want it to be able to be dropped also.\n\nHaving said that, my OCD nature makes me uncheck the drop option each time so that they're both the same, despite how pointless it is.",
