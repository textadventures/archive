Like this :\r\n```\r\nif (player.ammo > 0) {\r\n    [enemy name here].hp = [enemy name here].hp - player.dmg\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    msg (\"Out of ammo\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNever mind. It was a problem with one of the guns configured to have infinite ammo.  Apparently something wasnt working with the \"infinite\" set as the maximum ammo. I set it to 9999 and made it change to 9999 everytime ammo went down and its working now.",
