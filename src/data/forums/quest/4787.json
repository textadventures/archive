If you chose to bypass these food stops, you get another message 15 minutes later warning you about your health.

And the response has generally been negative. There are certain features of IF that have fallen into disrepute. One of them is mazes. Another is limited inventory (e.g. &quot;you can't carry any more&quot;) sort of situations, where you have to constantly keep shuffling what you're carrying. Another is the &quot;hunger&quot; puzzle, where you need to keep finding food from time to time to stay alive.\n\nI understand very well that the desire is some form of realism. Believe it or not, this seems to be discouraged from seasoned IF authors and players. The question always is: why does or should the player care about this? What does it contribute to the game?\n\nNow, some games absolutely demand a hunger/thirst sort of dynamic. If your main character has crashed landed in the desert and needs to get back to civilization before dying, then resource management is a key part of what the game is all about. However, tacking a non-essential resource management aspect onto a game that doesn't require it is perceived more as busy work and a grind than a *meaningful* addition to a game.\n\nSpeaking personally, there are certain features of an IF game that will drive me away from even bothering to play as soon as I get a whiff. One is resource management sorts of mechanics, and the other is real time play. If I want the irritation of the former, I have real life to turn to for that. Why would I play a game with the same frustrations? And the latter makes it necessary to be at the game constantly to fight the time demon. \n\nSince you seem to be combining the two, it means that basically if I'm playing and I get called away (dinner, minor family crisis, nature calls, etc), I may very well come back and find that I have died. (I tried a game on this site recently where, while playing, I was distracted for less than 30 seconds only to find when I turned my attention back that I had been killed. Needless to say, I didn't try the game again.) It is a different style, but the vast majority of IF can be taken at the player's pace. If you do plan to have real time elements, you might want to consider some sort of &quot;pause&quot; capability (as odd as that seems).\n\nI just want to emphasize again: just as with the best fiction, IF does not need to incorporate a complete simulation of real life. (I would not, for instance, want to have to find a toilet from time to time either). I feel the calling myself, to try to make it immersive the way other more graphical simulations can be. But I would say don't let real life simulation aspects hamper the player experience. Don't let it detract from the story you're trying to tell or the goal you're trying to achieve. If such features are key to what the game is all about from an overall design point of view (in a critical way), then fair enough. But I would be very careful about putting in non-essential annoyances in the pursuit of the reality god. Really, while people may wonder, nobody ever complained that the characters on Star Trek never go to the bathroom. They're much more interested in the stories and being engaged on a dramatic level and staying focused on what's important.\n\nJust my take. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) --> As always, do what you wish.
