'Examine key' produces 'which 'key do you mean?' if I'm carrying the key in the same room as the keyhole, which looks a bit odd. Is there a way to disable partial name matches for individual objects, or something else more blindingly obvious that I am overlooking (beyond just changing the name altogether...difficult to think what else to call a keyhole, though)?\r\n\r\nThanks, as ever.",
