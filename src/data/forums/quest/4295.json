      "EditableText": "Hi all,\n\nI am new to Quest and coding in general, so please forgive my noob questions.\n\nI am making a game that resembles a Remote Desktop interface. Part of the game involves accessing emails and evidence files to solve a crime. I want the player to be able to use look at/open/read interchangeably to access the information in the email/evidence object. However, I know that &quot;open&quot; has its own special behaviours and I also don't know a way to edit the response for all three commands simultaneously without having to code for each one individually.\n\nSo, my questions are: is it possible to modify a response for a group of commands in one place, and can I make those particular commands (i.e. look at/open/read) behave in the same way?",
