      "EditableText": "Hello,\r\nI notice that, with CombatLib, if a weapon is made usable it'll display \"use\" in its verbs tab by default. However, unequiping the weapon will wipe \"use\" from the verbs tab, though the command will still function properly. I've tried skirting around this issue by trying to change a default Split function that ties into equipping and unequipping a weapon to include \"use\" but it was to no avail and only created more problems than it solved.\r\nDoes anyone have a workaround to this so that \"use\" doesn't disappear from the verbs tab?\r\nThanks",
