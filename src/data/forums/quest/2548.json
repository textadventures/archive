      "EditableText": "Hey guys\n\nIm currently working my way through the tutorial for Quest 4 - I have to say this is a great program. But ive run into a problem in chapter 12.4, where you use the defibrillator (or &quot;defib pack&quot; in this version of the tutorial game...) on Bob. The tutorial says you should click &quot;yes&quot; for allowing the player to take this item. Well, thats the first problem I have. Y'see, i cant actually take items without adding a script telling the game to take it and put it in my inventory. Just clicking &quot;yes let this item be taken&quot; doesnt work. Second Problem: I set everything up properly including my &quot;take defib pack&quot; problem (fixed with a script). only if i type &quot;use defib pack on Bob&quot; it doesnt do a thing. i set up the Use Properties too.  Can anyone tell me what the whole problem is? Ive uploaded the asl file so you can take a look to see what im doing wrong.\n\nThanks.",
