I am now able to save items per user name and have them come  back at login.  \n\nThe problem I'm having now is that when I log back on and my items are returned to me, the associated stat properties are not showing up.\n\n(e.g. I have a sword that gives me +2 STR and +2 CON. Works fine when I recieve the item, I log off, log back on, still have the sword in my inventory, but my stats for STR and CON are back to 0)\n\nHopefully someone has an answer for this.
