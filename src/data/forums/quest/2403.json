      "EditableText": "Hi, just got Quest 4 last night and I've been working on a simple little adventure. It's gone smoothly until now; I read the topics in the last three pages of the forum but couldn't find this exact issue.\n\nI have two rooms, riverside and westbank. Two completely separate (not copied) objects are in both, tree and tree2. Tree in riverside has to be cut down; once it is, the exit between the rooms is unlocked, and the player can either use the directional arrow or type &quot;walk tree&quot; to walk across. Tree2 in westbank simply lets you look at it, walk across IT to get back to riverside, or keep at it with the axe, making tree2 inaccessible and locking the exit. This all works fine.\n\nBut whenever I go to westbank by any means -- the exit, walking, or climbing the felled tree -- another &quot;tree&quot; is generated in westbank, except with all actions turning up as &quot;You can't do X to that&quot;. I've been completely befuddled by this and can't figure out why this new, phantom tree keeps appearing in the room. (Cutting away tree2 doesn't remove the bug tree, and no bug trees appear back in riverside). Any ideas on where I've gone wrong?",
