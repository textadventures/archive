However the player must be wearing a coat and have nothing in the inventory, as this would be too heavy to climb otherwise. Is there a way to check against this, without too much scripting. Hope this makes sense to you.

But since then yeah, oh! yeah. I had a good look at your coding you sent me\nif (ListCount(ScopeInventory ()=0 ) {player.parent= another room. Which at first I did not understand, but when I looked again I realised that it was telling there was no items in the inventory. So I changed it to 1 in an if statement and then made sure I flagged my coat(object) to worn. Then all I had to do was to make sure that the only object in the inventory was the coat worn and if that was correct I could climb out. Thanks a million. once again. Hope this makes sense because I waffle a lot.
