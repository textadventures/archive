      "EditableText": "Hi, new user here.\n\nI'm trying to create a room that is dark, but allows the player to use a single exit, and also examine(using the look command) objects in the room.  Well, only 1 object for now, the ground, which is an object inside the dark room.\n\nI got the exit working by setting it's light settings to &quot;show even in the dark&quot;.  Now the player can leave the room just fine.\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to work for scenery objects or indeed any objects at all.  I have the object's feature &quot;lightness and darkness&quot; checked under features, and have set the light level to &quot;show even in the dark&quot;, but the game still won't respond to &quot;look at ground&quot;, or make a link to it in the description of the room.\n\nAlso, the link to the &quot;object&quot; in the room description for the dark room isn't letting me click on it to examine the scenery ground, it just acts like plain text in the game, despite being tagged in the room description.  I'm guessing this is related to the look command not working and the game not listing ground because the room is dark.\n\nSince my project only has two rooms anyway, I'll attach it.\n\n----\n\nI don't know if I'm going about this the right way either.  (I am totally new to the software, but not to programming concepts or how these games are usually laid out in code objects.)\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is set up a series of rooms that are &quot;dark&quot;, but can be either visited with an item that makes them lit up, or can be all &quot;turned on&quot; as other rooms light sources are made brighter.  Puzzles and using certain objects would toggle the lit state of rooms, allowing the player to go back and fully explore the dark places they previously could only walk through.  \n\nIn other words, think along the lines of a cave where normally you can't see anywhere, but light lets certain areas show you all their objects and safely navigate new passages.  And a few magically or mundane light sources that have some remote controls in other rooms.  (It should be noted that in my written plans, I also have a few timeline versions of the rooms for past/present/future, but I currently intend to use different copies of the finished cavern &quot;maze&quot; to pull off the time changing illusion, since the player can only ever be in one time period at once, and a lot of the puzzles have major changes between time periods anyway.)\n\nI'm also trying to use the hyperlink descriptive text to connect all this into something explorable with the mouse.  Thus why the text clickable links are colored the same as the regular text.\n\nIs this something reasonable to do in Quest?  If so, am I on the right track?  Or would it be better to simply change exits and make two different copies of each room instead of using the built in light source system?\n\n-------\n\nAnd yes, I realize this is probably diving into the deep end of the pool.  x_x  I didn't really feel inspired to do anything simpler after the tutorial though.",
