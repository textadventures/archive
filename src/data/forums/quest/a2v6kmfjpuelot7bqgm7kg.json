I also see in the player object the ability to limit the number of items as well as weight, but I cannot get it to work it seems. For instance I've set the limit to 8 items and have a wood log item. I clone and move it to player but it will add beyond 8 of them. Is there something wrong with the cloning part? Does it not consider each instance individual? Is it just not implemented?\r\n\r\nI noticed a post about this asking how it was done, but that was back in 2009. I would assume the feature would be in by now but I have just now started getting into Quest so I have no idea how the different iterations are going and I haven't had a chance to really deep dive into the change log.",
