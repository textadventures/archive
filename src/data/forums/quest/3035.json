Can someone let me know what/how listextend type works? Thanks\n\nHow can I when adding the Wear and Remove verbs also REMOVE the default use verb? I can edit each object to remove it from their inventory verb list, but I want the wearable class to do this automatically for anything wearable (you can't use wearable objects, only put them on)\n\nOn the same subject, when the Wear and Remove verbs get added to the object, the inventory screen isn't wide enough to show the 2 new verbs. I need to manually widen the inventory pane while running the game. Is there a way to auto adjust that? New players would never know they can't see all the inventory verbs.",

The basic function I can guess from the very minor peek I had at the source code is that it defines an extended field for that attribute, merging the values into the field on get.\n\nIn layman's terms, as far as I could gather it just adds the verbs into the inventory verb list, it seems to work in practice.",
