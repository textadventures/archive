      "EditableText": "So I made a silly joke game today, just testing out the software for the first time. I had my boyfriend playtest it to see what he'd do and he was faux-offended when he typed &quot;sit&quot; and the game told him there was &quot;no time for lounging around&quot;. I thought it would be funny to put an ending in where you sit down on the floor and lose all motivation to continue. So I went to my commands list and tried to add &quot;sit,&quot; and Quest told me &quot;an element called sit already exists in the game&quot;. Cool. It's a built-in command along with stuff like go, open, close, etc., which I understand. How do I use it though?    \n\nIt's easy enough for me to make &quot;sit on floor&quot; happen-- make a floor object in the room, when &quot;sit&quot; is applied to it, it runs a script that prints a message and ends the game or whatever. That's not the problem. I just want to know if I can get &quot;sit&quot; alone to do something different, other than spit out the &quot;no time for lounging around&quot; message. \n\nSorry if I'm missing something essential here. I have been through the tutorial, I've searched the forum and the wiki and I've learned a lot in the past 24-ish hours, but my brain isn't inclined toward programming and it's slow to learn systems like this. <!-- s:oops: --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /><!-- s:oops: -->\n\n[b:13lnikpb]EDIT:[/b:13lnikpb] As usual, after I finally decide I've lost and posted on a support forum, I found [url=http&#58;//docs&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/quest/guides/random_default_answers&#46;html:13lnikpb]the solution[/url:13lnikpb], or at least a really good hint, while searching for information about something completely different.
