It has a plate attached that says 'Tower', so after having the player read it, I want the alias of the door to change from 'Door 1' to 'Tower door'. \r\n\r\nI tried this using a flag, but it didn't work. It would probably be better to use the door attributes, but I can't figure out how to do that. \r\n\r\nHelp would be much appreciated! I use the desktop version btw.   ",
