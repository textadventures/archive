Hopefully, it won't take too much longer.  I originally thought it was going to take a long time to create a text game from a huge 3D adventure game.  On the contrary, the creation time is going along rather quickly as I am almost half way through.  On the same note, it looks like the play time will be drastically shorter than the original due to there not being any graphics nor animations.  I guess that is normal for text adventures though.  I don't see myself playing ANY text adventure game longer than a half an hour, whereas, a 3D graphical adventure, I can spend hours and hours on.\n\nAnyway, I'm rather long-winded so again...thanks!!\n\nsteve the gaming guy  <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P -->",
