      "EditableText": "I have worked on a few of these games in the past, although never released.  I got an itch to try again.  However I am curious what is popular these days.  I am not sure of the actual terms, but the title pretty much explains it.  Are people these days more into fast clicking on important objects that are in link form?  Or are they old school and like to type out their actions?\r\n\r\nWhere the one can be much easier to navigate the game, they can also be too telling, too easy and too hand holding.  There is no \"exploration\" basically and it almost becomes like a visual novel in my opinion.  Perhaps more elaborate and well made ones are better, but that is how I feel in general.  While at the same time if you go old school, players may just become completely lost and frustrated, because they either did not know what to search for or how to search for it to begin with.  Commands can change from game to game, even with in Interactive Fiction community.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to do both, but as an option?  Have a setting the player can choose for one or the other or I assume both if that is what they wanted?  Although I also assume that is more work involved for the author as well, trying to cater to everyone.  I just don't know.  But I do know I have missed you all!  ^^!  How is the original creator by the way.  Does he ever drop by?  How has the new gang been?  Everyone doing well, even in these times?",
