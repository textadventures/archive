      "EditableText": "In every other system I've played games in, itâ€™s been possible to refer to an item by its name and then thereafter refer to it as â€˜itâ€™ and have the system understand what I mean. In Quest it seems different. I knocked together a little test game and created a few items: a book, a table and a desk. I had a command to read the book. If I examine the book and follow it with READ BOOK, the command is processed as normal. However, if I READ IT, the game tells me I canâ€™t do that. \n\nOn top of that, Quest will often be confused when you use the â€˜itâ€™ command after referring to another item. Typing X DESK, GET BOOK, READ IT will have the X DESK and GET BOOK commands work fine, but with READ IT Quest will try to read the desk, despite the last item referred to being the book.\n\nI've also noticed oddities in custom commands where Quest seems to get confused about which item you're actually referring to. I have a custom command to move the book (GET #BOOK#) from the desk into the playerâ€™s inventory, but when I attempt to GET DESK as the first command, Quest runs the GET #BOOK# command instead. Is this a flaw in Quest or is there something I'm doing wrong?",
