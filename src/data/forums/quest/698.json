      "EditableText": "I think this topic was actually brought up once, but I forgot, so I'm going to ask again. I have a bomb that goes off, and it uses a timer to countdown how much time is left until it detonates. I have a command that disarms it, and I shut off the timer, but the problem is, that the timer doesn't restart; it just pauses. So, for example, let's say you disarm the bomb with 3 seconds to spare, the next time you make it go off again, instead of starting over again at 20 seconds, it counts down 3 seconds. I have a variable that actually counts down, and that can be reset back to 20, but the timer just pauses. Is there any way possible to restart it? Thanks.",
