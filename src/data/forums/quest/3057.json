      "EditableText": "While testing out the revamped spell casting command, I noticed in the battle against my first miniboss that casting a spell four times in a row against it gave the death message for a guard. After that, the spell became ineffective against the miniboss. I have no idea why it's switching messages. I've changed the aliases and alternates to try and keep them separated, but it still displays the guard death message for an elite agent. It does the same when there are two enemies in the same area and then becomes ineffective on the other enemy, breaking timers connected to both mobs. I have no idea what's going on, I've been reading the code in notepad and i just can't see what happened.\n\nCan someone take a look and figure this out? I've added in a 'teleport' command to take you to the hallway where the miniboss can be found in case you want to test it as well.\n\ntype 'yes'\nenter name\ntype 'teleport'\nexamine locker room\nuse master card on locker room reader\ngo south\nsearch large crate\n\nthat will summon the miniboss for fighting. The spells I'm having trouble with are Luna-Flare and Fireball, though any fixes will be applied to all spells just in case.
