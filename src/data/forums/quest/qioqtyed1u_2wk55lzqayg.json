Here's the problem: \r\n\r\nNew file, enabled the map, inserted the \"before enter room\"-variable, then the \"after entering room\"-script as instructed. I changed the size of the first room to 2x2, put the exit line on the lower left and tried to move to the 2nd room. Moving works BUT the instant I click \"move/south\" the map resets to, i guess, default and displays the first room as a regular 1x1 with a centered exit line connecting to the second room. Moving back and forth works fine though. EDIT: The first room kepps changing to it's desired 2x2 form everytime I re-enter it.  Any idea how to keep the first room/all rooms at their size constantly? \r\n\r\nMy goal is to have some sort of architectual layout of an actual house. No exit lines, rooms adjacent to each other and so forth. ",
