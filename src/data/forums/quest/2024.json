I've been tinkering with doing the same thing ... having come from Inform 7 it seems strange to have objects not auto group ... i.e. I have a room with 3 candles in it ... I'd like to write a custom room description where the object list says something like ... 'a black box, 3 candles, and a jar of batwings' ... I could do this with having a single object called '3 candles' or simply 'candles' with the prefix 3 ... maybe done using a property ... but the player needs to be able to take the candles and use them one by one ... I could write a custom 'take' script for the candles where when the player takes one and it creates a new object called 'candle' to put into the players inventory (or maybe the 'candles' object is a container with 3 seperate candle objects in it or something like that.) ... and then decrease the property/prefix by one ... which would then display '2 candles' in the object list ... the problem is when the player puts the candles down again ... if he drops them all in the same room, its going to go back to the 'a chair, a table, a candle, a candle, and a candle' kind of description ... which is, to say the least, weird sounding. What I really want to be able to happen is after the player picks up each individual candle ... or lets say he collects candles from several rooms ... and then drops them all into the same room ... that the description would automatically 'adjust' ... to say '5 candles' or however many he dropped.... any suggestions on how to do this? maybe adjust the 'drop' command so that if the player drops an object and another with the same alias is in the room, that it hides one and labels the other one as plural or something? maybe auto create a 'plural' version of the objects? this seems very cumbersome ... I'd think that some kind of modification to the list objects procedure would be better ... does anyone know of a working example I could look at? Thanks.",
