To avoid making 24 copies of the same script, I'd suggest creating a turnscript, so it checks every turn. It would look something like:\r\n```\r\nif (game.score = 24) {\r\n  msg (\"Congratulations, you finished all the quests!\")\r\n  finish\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border-top: 1px dashed red\"/>\r\n\r\n> Is there a way to make a list of \"achievements\" for the player? A \"completed quest\" list? I'd like to give the mini-quests names and have them show up together with the inventory and score in the status field.\r\n\r\nI think the easiest way to do a quest list without coding would be making the quests into objects, with as much detail as you want in their descriptions.\r\n\r\nYou could give the player an object called \"list of completed quests\" or something like that; and maybe \"quests in progress\" as well. Make them transparent containers, so the player can see what's inside them but can't take stuff out, and move the quests into the right book as necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you're using this method, you could also modify your turnscript like this, so it counts how many quests are in the list rather than having to keep a separate score:\r\n<pre><code>if (ListCount (GetDirectChildren (<em style=\"font-family: initial; color: blue\">completed quests</em>)) = 24) {\r\n  msg (\"Congratulations, you finished all the quests!\")\r\n  finish\r\n}</code></pre>",
