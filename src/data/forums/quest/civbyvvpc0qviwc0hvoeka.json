Subtraction:\r\n\r\n// player.strength = 100\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] player.strength - 10\r\n// player.strength = [player.strength = 100] - 10\r\n// player.strength = [100] - 10\r\n// player.strength = 90\r\n\r\n3. Multiplication:\r\n\r\n// player.strength = 100\r\n\r\nset variable player.strength = [EXPRESSION] player.strength * 3\r\n// player.strength = [player.strength = 100] * 3\r\n// player.strength = [100] * 3\r\n// player.strength = 300\r\n\r\n4.

Modulus (Division, but it finds/gets/returns the REMAINDER):\r\n\r\ndoes these operations: cyclic, is number even or odd, or factors/divisibilities of a number\r\n\r\ncyclic example:\r\n\r\n// game.hour_count = GetRandomInt (0,100)\r\n\r\nset variable game.clock_civilian_hour = [EXPRESSION] game.hour_count % 12\r\n// game.clock_civilian_hour = [0 to 11]\r\n\r\nset variable game.clock_military_hour = [EXPRESSION] game.hour_count % 24\r\n// game.clock_military_hour = [0 to 23]\r\n\r\nis a number even/odd example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// game.number = GetRandomInt (0,100)\r\n\r\n// ----------------\r\n\r\nif (game.number % 2 = 0) {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is an even number\")\r\n} else {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is an odd number\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n// or:\r\n\r\nif (game.number % 2 = 1) {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is an odd number\")\r\n} else {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is an even number\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nfactoring/disibility of a number example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// game.number = GetRandomInt (0,100)\r\n\r\nif (game.number % 2 = 0) {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is divisible by 2, or to say it differently, 2 is a factor of \" + game.number)\r\n} else if (game.number % 3 = 0) {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is divisible by 3, or to say it differently, 3 is a factor of \" + game.number)\r\n} else if (game.number % 4 = 0) {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is divisible by 4, or to say it differently, 4 is a factor of \" + game.number)\r\n} else if (game.number % 5 = 0) {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is divisible by 5, or to say it differently, 5 is a factor of \" + game.number)\r\n} else if (game.number % 6 = 0) {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is divisible by 6, or to say it differently, 6 is a factor of \" + game.number)\r\n} else if (game.number % 7 = 0) {\r\n  msg (game.number + \" is divisible by 7, or to say it differently, 7 is a factor of \" + game.number)\r\n}\r\n// etc 'else ifs' for infinity of factor/divisibility of a number\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nthe 'if' Script:\r\n\r\n'WHATEVER' Page -> 'Page' Tab -> Page Type: [script] or [script + text] -> (see below)\r\n\r\nadd new script -> 'scripts' section/category -> 'if' Script -> (see below)\r\n\r\n```\r\nif [EXPRESSION] CONDITIONAL_EXPRESSION_1\r\n-> then -> add new script\r\n// optional:\r\nelse if [EXPRESSION] CONDITIONAL_EXPRESSION_2\r\n-> then -> add new script\r\n// optional: additional 'else ifs'\r\n// optional:\r\nelse\r\n-> then -> add new script\r\n```\r\n\r\nsome examples (in code... hopefully you can figure out how to do with the 'add new script' script options in the GUI/Editor, if not, let me/us know, and we'll help you with them):\r\n\r\n```\r\n// game.test_score = GetRandomInt (0,100)\r\n// game.test_grade =\"unknown\"\r\n\r\n// ---------------------------------\r\n\r\n// high to low:\r\n\r\nif (game.test_score > 89) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"A\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score > 79) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"B\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score > 69) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"C\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score > 59) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"D\"\r\n} else {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"F\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n// or alternatively (if you don't like the '-1' for the Value: if you want to use the 'greater than or equal to' operation / operator symbol), high to low:\r\n\r\n// (to do the 'greater/lesser than or equal to' operations / operator symbols: the '=' must be on the right side and the '</>' must be on the left side, and there must be NO space between the '=' and '</>', see the below two lines)\r\n\r\n//  (greater than or equal to: >= )\r\n// ( lesser than or equal to: <= )\r\n\r\nif (game.test_score >= 90) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"A\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score >= 80) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"B\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score >= 70) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"C\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score >= 60) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"D\"\r\n} else {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"F\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n// low to high:\r\n\r\nif (game.test_score < 60) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"F\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score < 70) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"D\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score < 80) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"C\"\r\n} else if (game.test_score < 90) {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"B\"\r\n} else {\r\n  game.test_grade = \"A\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n```\r\n// stringlist_variable = split (\"true;false\", \";\")\r\n// game.orc_dead = StringListItem (stringlist_variable, GetRandomInt (0, ListCount (stringlist_variable) -
