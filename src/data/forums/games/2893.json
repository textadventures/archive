I've noticed that people have been posting some gamefiles and whatnot of late, and I thought I would make a suggestion in order to help keep these things more organized. As with other forums I frequent, I think things would be a lot easier if the first post in a game thread have the downloadable game file. That way, whenever you have a new version to upload, you can just edit the first post and switch it out there. This makes it easier for people to find the latest version of any files being posted, without having to read through (potentially) pages of messages to find the latest one.\n\nI know it's not much of an issue at the moment as we don't get that much activity, but maybe it would be better to switch to a system like this so it doesn't become a problem in the future when Quest becomes insanely popular and we start getting hundreds of posts a day on the forums. <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->\n\nAnyway, it's just a suggestion. What do you people think?",
