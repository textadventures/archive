      "EditableText": "I am thinking of trying to use quest to implement some old style RPG gamebooks, or at least their style.\n\nFor example, the old Lone Wolf series of books by Joe Dever (who has kindly given permission to redistribute his original works via [url=http&#58;//www&#46;projectaon&#46;org/:2xfndhbw]Project Aon[/url:2xfndhbw], or the Fighting Fantasy series by Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson.\n\nFor any of you who have not come across these (where have you been), the are a cross between IF and D&amp;D.\n\nA book is split into, on average, between 300-400 passages.  At the end of at least 50% of these passages you generally have a choice to make.  Most choices are however, unlike an IF dungeon, irreversible.  This in and of itself is not really an issue, as one way paths are easy to implement.\n\nWhat sets these books apart though is the use of random numbers, skills and combat.\n\nLets take these one at a time.\n\nSkills - In the Lone Wolf series, and in some of the Fighting Fantasy series, you get to choose from a selection of skills and abilities.  These choices will affect the outcome of the game as you cannot select all of them.  The easiest way I can see to implement skills and abilities is to make the objects that fit into a container, with a limited capacity.\n\nThe next is random choices and random numbers, again I feel this should be easy to implement.\n\nThe last is combat.  And this is where I am truly at a loss.  Combat systems vary, but generally work with 2 stats, Skill and Stamina or Endurance (FF also allows Luck to be used if memory serves me correctly).  In LW you subtract the enemies skill from yours, the result is the combat ratio.  Then you pick a random number from the chart or roll 1D10 and consult a table.  Find the column that represents the ratio then look down said column to find the endurance losses for both sides.  In FF you take your skill, add the roll of 2D6 then take the opponents skill and add the roll of another 2D6, whichever is the highest wins that round and does a fixed amount of damage.\n\nSo thoughts - is this a worthwhile venture do you think (I should be able to reproduce LW in this format under the Project Aon licensing agreement if so).  And how would you implement the Gamebook features?\n\nAlso, is there anything you think I have overlooked?",

In the case of gamebooks, the mechanics aren't actually built into the book so it would be fine in that case.</blockquote><br/><br/>That is fair enough - I am only looking to do something in that &quot;style&quot;, as there are many different ways of conducting battles etc, I was planning on making my own combat rules.<br/><br/><blockquote><cite>cdutton184 wrote:</cite>The only restriction in Quest's CYOA which could be incorporated into newer versions is that Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks use word/number puzzles a lot.  <br/><br/>For example, you come a across a character earlier in the book and find out his name. The book asks you later have you met this character, so what is his name?  The letters of his name are converted into their sequential values in the alphabet, i.e. A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. The numbers are added up (sometimes with extra values added or subtracted) and you turn to this new reference to play on.<br/><br/>So instead, if an input command for a word/number answer was incorporated into Quest's CYOA then compared to the right answer and linked to the right page then it would make it more versatile.</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><cite>Alex wrote:</cite>Nice idea, and should be easy to implement, so I've logged this for Quest 5.3: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://quest.codeplex.com/workitem/1098\">http://quest.codeplex.com/workitem/1098</a><!-- m --></blockquote><br/><br/>Excellent.<br/><br/>I agree, in the books you had to work out the section number.  With a computer program, we could still have the user do that (as that could be a puzzle in and of itself, albeit a simple one for those good with mathematics), or we could just have them type the answer.",

You slip off your backpack and begin to pull out pen and paper.  The King stands up to look at what you are doing, he does not look amused and even looks a little suspicious.  You pay him no head as he leans over with the ax in his hands to see exactly what it is you could be possibly doing; are you ignoring him, did you have to write it down, or are you going for a hidden weapon!?!  You dig a little deeper, moving odds and ends around and then you shout, “Ahhh Ha!!!!”, and pull out a brand new shiny calculator.

Your death was so quick you did not even register the pain, but your skull was completely sliced in half on through to your neck even to your upper chest cavity where it is now embedded.  You are only still standing, because The King is still holding onto his ax.
