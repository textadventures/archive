I picked a hex grid because a) it is more interesting/unique and more of a coding challenge, and b) movement/distance to things is more realistic.

Also, things like grid-clicking would be a lot easier.\r\n\r\n@Pixie -- I thought about drawing hexagons but, frankly, didn't know how to make that work!  The left/right vertices of a hex would have to jut outside of a square room (into the adjacent square rooms), and that seemed like a very difficult problem to tackle.\r\n\r\nDon't know if this game will ever really be complete -- I need a few more things, especially a combat system, which will take a while to implement...",
