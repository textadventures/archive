      "EditableText": "hi Novirtue, thanks for the game, the drawings are really charming (I love the shower curtain). I think there are a few areas you could think about polishing. A lot of items are just set up with the 'use' verb. For example, you can't 'take shower', or 'shower', you have to 'use shower' (even though the text says, 'You should take a shower'). You can't 'shave', you have to 'use shaver'. Later, when you examine the Utili Tool, it says &quot;you simply ask what you want and this makes it for you&quot;. When you 'ask tool for omelet', it doesn't understand. You have to 'utili tool make omelet'. But then it's not clear if you've already eaten the omelet -- when you try 'eat omelet', it says it can't see that.\n\nI think the main point is that the game text suggests commands you can do, and you should reasonably try to anticipate what the player will try and make those commands possible. Then the player gets more involved with the fictional world you've created, rather than clicking around on lists and menus.",
