Here is my point by point argument:\n\n1.)  It has been a long time since a game has been uploaded to the archive for us to play.  Granted, that is probably because most of them are not of the highest quality.  But still...the lack of new games gives the impression to new people that there is no reason to try to make a game because no one will ever see it.  Quest is not in the front of the pack on IF authoring systems at this point (though I personaly like it more than the others I've tried) and we should not discourage newbies from attempting to express their creative side in this medium.\n\n2.)  This, of course, leads us to the other problem (the catch-22) of this situation.  That problem is:  If all the games made with quest are as much fun as stapleing parts of your anatomy (that will go unnamed) to an angry badger, then who will want to try (besides us) to correct the issue by making a game that is not subaverage. \n\n3.)Alex is busy.  He has to be busy.  I have owned a business before (I had a bar once) and I can tell you that it is more work than you can imagine.  He is trying to sell this product in a market saturated with IF systems that you can use for free.  (yeah, I know you can use quest for free...but if that was his goal, then why sell it?)  He may not have time to go through everyones games (definatly if they made it in 3 hours or less and it is about trying to get to the bathroom in time).\n\nMY SOLUTION:\n--Okay, the problems listed above do exist so here is my solution for them.  Lets take all those new moderators, and make them like a jury: The Court of Games (or whatever).  They can weed through all the garbage by having each member play through the games that are uploaded and voting on their quality (just an up or down vote).  Any game with a thumbs up goes to Alex for final approval. \n\nThis would accomplish:\n1.)Keeping Alex in control of his product and how it is represented.\n2.)Keep us from having to play a bunch of crap.\n3.)Give incentive to keep people from making crap.\n4.)Throw off the illuison that Quest is getting stagnet (which it is not if you look at the forum.)\n5.)Provide new games every quarter or so.\n\nWell, thats my idea.  If it sucks, hopefully some of you can come up with something even better.  My hope is that we can address the issue, because resolving it will only be good for all of us that are working hard on making quality products.\n\nThanks for your time,\nDr. Froth",

Neither is too attractive for a user when there are alternatives where 3) basic technical competence is automatic.\n\nI also think the manual has something to do with it; the DM4 gives the parts of the language important to most games up front, then gradually works into the less common things, and finally gives a reference list of the full language / library; the Quest manual (when I last looked) almost starts out with the big reference list.",

Very few people will try to write a game with a system that hasn't produced at least one really good game. It's wrong to say that a system that hasn't produced a decent game isn't capable of producing one, but that's the way 99% of people think.</p></blockquote><br/><br/>(&quot;Technical competence&quot; will refer to quality from a programming point of view; how well does it understand and respond to input.  It specifically does not include writing quality.)<br/><br/>Basic technical competence is a useful gauge: when large numbers of games made with a system have the same problems, it's a sign that either 1) the system is not capable of creating technically adequate games or 2) it requires a good deal of effort just to get the normal stuff working.  Neither is too attractive for a user when there are alternatives where 3) basic technical competence is automatic.<br/><br/>I also think the manual has something to do with it; the DM4 gives the parts of the language important to most games up front, then gradually works into the less common things, and finally gives a reference list of the full language / library; the Quest manual (when I last looked) almost starts out with the big reference list.",
