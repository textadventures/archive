      "EditableText": "StoreyMinus, the modern below-London dungeon crawl, has been upgraded. Some important features:\r\n\r\n1) Combat is much quicker and dynamic. The old method as too slow and changed to sequential. No more guessing about where your opponent will be. If he's in front of you and you can swing, swing. He'll still be there.\r\n\r\n2) Sound now accompanies many of the actions in the game.\r\n\r\n3) There is background mood music setting the game's pace and feel. It really adds to the ambiance.\r\n\r\n4) A training game exists to help players come to grips with this detailed, option-orientated game.\r\n\r\nAnd you can play it right here:\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/dmo-xkger0arz5csjfra8g/storeyminus",
