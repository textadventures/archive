And I am proud to bring you a brand-new and totally free game called “**Beached!**” An oldskool text adventure with modern-day touches.\r\n\r\nIn **Beached!** you play a stranded, cocky castaway roaming a deserted island in the Caribbean Sea. Help this poor guy survive the island, using nothing but it’s natural resources, which is easier said than done, of course. \r\n\r\n**Beached!** Is a small game, as it is the first in a series to come. Survival is your main goal in this first part, escaping the island will happen in later episodes. I hope you’ll enjoy Beached! For its atmosphere and crazy sense of humor if you force the protagonist into wacky situations.\r\n\r\nPlay Beached! at: **https://beached.000webhostapp.com/** or find in the **'Comedy'** Category of this site: **http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/atodxbi5nu_knu_m0c5t0q/beached**.\r\nIt’s a totally free game with NO advertisements.\r\nPlease, post feedback if you enjoyed the game (or not...).\r\n\r\nGreetz,\r\nEwald Bal\r\nmail: info@brightsight-people.com\r\n",

I had a difficult time figuring out what I needed to do - I NEVER would have come up with the shell, water, berries combo thing.  Perhaps I relied to quickly on the built-in walk-through?\r\n4.  I think the game could have done well with some subtle hints nestled throughout.  Short, but descriptive comments suggesting what my goal was.

All-in-all, this is much better constructed than most of the stuff that gets published here.

It's been a long couple days and I'm trying to relax... may not be the best time for a TA!  =)  \r\n\r\nGood luck and I hope you continue working on games.  I think they have good promise!

Sorry for that.\r\n\r\nMy game is a bit different from many other games posted here, because it's written in javascript rather then Quest or Squiffy. This means I have probably more developer tools at hand. Some of the other games may seem a bit less decorated, but might have much better puzzles or a bigger sense of humor or atmosphere. It's a personal thing.\r\n\r\nI Hope you'll enjoy Beached! some more and will look out for part 2. All the feedback given on the many forums will help make part 2 a more complete and enjoyable game.\r\nSo thanks for your compliments and feedback!",
