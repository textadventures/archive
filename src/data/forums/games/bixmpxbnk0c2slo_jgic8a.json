      "EditableText": "I have updated My game, Gilui & Orima, to version 0.3.2. Here are the full patch notes\r\n\r\n- Improved Return to Title button.\r\n- Additional Improvement to the Profanity Filter.\r\n    - More instances of \"Curse\" are now properly censored.\r\n- Removed \"Spoilers\" to late-game areas. (Scenario 15 Outcomes)\r\n- You are no longer required to check the first example in the How to Play section of the game in order to access Scenario 15 Hints.\r\n- Added a passage dedicated to my Social Links because why not.\r\n- Bug Fixes/Dialogue Rewrites\r\n- Additional Polishing\r\n- Eliminated eggsman.\r\n\r\nYou can play the game via the link here:\r\n\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/vtozoeauzuuoilrg-wbjga/gilui-orima\r\n\r\nWhat is Gilui & Orima?\r\nGilui and Orima are cousins at it again with their usual antics. It's your job to decide what they are!\r\n\r\nHow to Play?\r\nYou will be given 4 prompts to choose from, and every prompt shows a different outcome. Just do that 15 times to beat the game. Easy as cheese!\r\n\r\nTake Note!\r\nScenarios are rarely related to one another. Go ahead and break continuity! Kill someone off to put them in again. Destroy the city to have it spotless to never have a city in the first place. Live a bonkers world to live bonkers! The limit is never the limit!\r\n\r\nRemember that sometimes, YOUR ACTIONS CAUSE CONSEQUENCES. Certain outcomes could affect future outcomes. Multiple playthroughs of the same outcome ARE INDEED required to get 100% completion because of these consequences. (For the quality of life, consequences will be listed in a tab that will be unlocked after your first gameplay.)\r\n\r\nSpread the Word!\r\nFeel free to reenact any and all scenarios you stumble upon for personal gain via live-action acting, animations, or voiceovers. Be sure to credit me in the end! If you don't, I'll sue you... (or not)\r\n\r\nAnd that's all there is. Enjoy the show brought to you by TheUpperDiamond.\r\n\r\nWARNING:\r\nThis game contains the following:\r\n\r\nMild Alcohol Reference\r\nApplied Violence\r\nComic Mischief\r\nLanguage (Uncensored: D@mn, @ss, H#ll, and P!ss. All other swears are either not used, applied, or fully/semi-censored.)\r\nMild Suggestive Themes\r\nUse of Tobacco\r\n\r\nThis game is intended for those people 13 years old and up. If you are not 13 years old or older and/or do not want to see anything listed above, do not play this game. (Profanity and Sexual Reference Filters are available to make it at least a G-rated game via the in-game settings menu.)\r\n\r\nThanks for playing. Even if you don't intend to play the game, I appreciate you reading this!\r\n-TheUpperDiamond",
