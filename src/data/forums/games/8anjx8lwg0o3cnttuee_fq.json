In the first room, you may choose whatever name you want but by defualt the character is called Gold. While still in the room, type \"give me money\", lowercase does not matter, just spell it correctly. After that, you will be given 20000 pokedollars! After that, make your way out of town and to the first Berry Shop! Down, out, west, east, north, west, east, south, northeast, southeast, north, east, north, east! (There should be a sign if you get lost.) Buy a few pokeballs, they cost 5000 pokedollars each! Test them out!\r\n\r\nThe pokeball in my game works differently than the pokeballs in the original games. To use it, just type \"use pokeball\", or click on use, and it should raise the catch rate! The catch rate decides how likely a pokemon will go into your inventory (player.catchrate + roll2, roll2 is a number roll between 1 and 20).\r\n\r\nTest them out! I want feedback! Tell me how it went!\r\n\r\nGame here. http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5jllte-m4e2e2whw4gf5jq/pokemon-type-harley-johto-and-sinnoh\r\n\r\nAlso, I tried and tested out a few functions.",
