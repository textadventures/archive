I copied and pasted a lot of scripts, and doing this led me to a deleted audio freezing up the original game, which I hadn't even known about. So, I fixed it in both games. Now, they both play without freezing. At least that is what I believe.\r\nI hope those of you whose games have frozen can find it in your heart to forgive me.\r\nIf you had wanted to play the board game or pet the hen, now is a better time than ever.",
