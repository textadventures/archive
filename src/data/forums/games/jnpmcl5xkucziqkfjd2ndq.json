      "EditableText": "I was thinking about the questions on the \"Which house would you be in?\" personality quizzes you find online. Rather than having a specific \"this question determines your race\", each answer can give points towards a race, class, or both. Some connections are obvious, some less so. For example, if your favourite colour is brown, that gives you points towards the \"barista\" class. Some of the colours determine your eye colour; the ones that correspond to colours of magic in this world will increase your points towards the mage classes, and possibly give you an appropriate elemental affinity. So across a dozen questions, if you pick all joke answers you'll probably get a bard/entertainer type class; and if you pick the logical/pedantic answers, you're more likely to get a scholar/mage type.\r\n\r\nI suspect some of the choices may seem odd because I've given the classes unusual names, so it's not so obvious what abilities they will have.\r\n\r\nOnce I've got the mechanics working neatly, I'll put in more questions, which will mean that your choices have more weight compared to the random factor. I'm planning them to start out with simple things that feel like a personality test, but then move on to questions like \"Where are you most likely to go for a drink? Pub / tavern /wine bar / dive bar / restaurant\", and \"How many drinks do you usually have?\" \"And what are you drinking?\" \"How do you respond when the guy next to you says hello?\" ... and that guy goes on to offer you a quest.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you spot the hidden answers, by the way? I'm not sure if I was being too subtle.\r\n\r\nI've also been playing around with allowing arbitrary answers. Modifying ShowMenu so that as well as allowCancel true/false, there's a third way which means that the player can either choose a menu option *or* type their own answer at the command prompt, and either way it gets passed to the same callback. The scripts need a little more polish for that, though.",
