However, to read you normally have to download an app, and the most popular apps are, in my experience, fairly awful experiences that demand money if you want to read more than a few lines.\r\n\r\nSo, I thought I'd throw together an completely browser based system, that would allow people to read, create and share their creations. \r\n\r\nIt's still a work in progress, but you can try it yourself at: [MyChatStory.com](http://mychatstory.com)\r\n\r\nThe stories themselves are powered by a modified version of Squiffy, hence me posting here.\r\n\r\nAppreciate it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but feel free to have a play. The stories themselves are best played on a smartphone, but will run in any modern internet browser.\r\n\r\n ",
