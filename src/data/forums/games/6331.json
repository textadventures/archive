I played it on my phone and, as far as it appeared on the mobile device, it was fine.  I am having issues on my PC.  Not sure but it might have something to do with your 'padding' under one of the game tabs.  Also, there are some minor things I would like to suggest (that certainly aren't game breaking, but it would smooth out the experience).\n\nBy the way, the little that I played seemed promising.  So, 'grats on that!  PM me if you want more specifics.  Or, if you would rather I'll post critiques on this thread.\n\nIf it isn't placed by this evening, I'll place it.  Thanks and keep writing games!",
