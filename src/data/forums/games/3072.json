Are they automatically updated or do you have to do it manually or do you have to actually remove the game you had already downloaded previously and then redownload it?  Like if I was a beta tester, how do I keep getting the newest version to keep being able to check the newest version of the game?  And I am not playing the web version, but the desktop version.\n\n  Also when someone does update their game (As in they said they fixed what was previously found with mistakes.) does both the desktop version and the online version get updated at the same time or does the game maker have to do it manually himself and one or the other, online or desktop, may never get updated if he or she forgot to do one or the other?",
