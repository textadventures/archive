      "EditableText": "Hi. My name is Liam. I am fourteen years old and I currently live in Queensland, Australia. I am a reader, writer and many other things and naturally found the concept of interactive fiction interesting. Quite some time ago I abandoned video games, simply finding them boring. But after reading the novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline I was inspired by the 80's gaming culture mentioned in the book and the text adventure concept. After player Zork, one of the original text adventure games, and researching interactive fiction I chanced upon a link to the Quest website. The software seemed far better to other alteratives so I downloaded it and here I am.    \n\nI have recently been dabbling with Quest and have made some progress with my basic test game. I am now searching for some feedback regarding my methods, the quality of the game and the ways in which I can improve. The game is currently unfinished and is using a very basic storyline. Any help will be greatly appreciated.",

There are a couple of issues in regards to commands, for example the inability to pick up the dirty clothes after you drop them, and no easy clear way to start the car. Description wise it's acceptable. \n\nAll in all, I pretty much knew what I was getting into booting up this game so my expectations weren't ridiculously high. So for what it is, it's decent. Keep at it, keep writing, and I'm sure you'll be able to contribute a good game in the future. \n\nThana",

I have been experimenting with scripts to add detail to my game. So far I have been relatively successful but have encountered a few problems. I have been trying to prevent the player from leaving the house before he has collected the clean clothes. I locked the exit and replaced the defualt locked message with, &quot;You should put on some clean clothes and collect your belongings first.&quot; I then added a script to unlock the exit if the player is carrying the clean clothing. When I tested it the locked message was displayed when I was and wasn't carrying the clean clothing. Do you have any ideas?\n\nI have also been considering turning my existing novel into a text adventure. Would you see this as a good idea.",
