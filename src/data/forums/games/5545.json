I made something similar to this over a year ago.\n\nDesign-wise, I can offer some advice and direction:\n\n-Don't do durability. Please don't put your players through that.\n\n-I've noticed that the maze stops abruptly at dead ends. This may be intentional, but you may want to make it less random.\n\n-Enemies can attack you as you enter a room - before you can respond.\n\n-The game can be kind of a crapshoot. I spent a lot of time running away from enemies and searching for a chest with a wooden sword in it because I couldn't handle the enemies without it.\n\n-Only one enemy should spawn in a room.\n\n-Beware of players being able to spam the &quot;Attack&quot; button. It can cause Quest to bug. To fix this, I gave each enemy a &quot;dead&quot; attribute (boolean), which began at &quot;false.&quot; Under the enemy's &quot;changedHP&quot; script, I set &quot;dead&quot; to &quot;true&quot; immediately as the enemy's HP reached 0. Then under the &quot;Attack&quot; script, I gave them an &quot;if&quot; condition. If enemy.dead = false, then execute the attack script. Else say, &quot;That enemy is dead.&quot;\n\n-Lastly, I think the damage formulas and stats should be somewhat more complicated. Adding a GetRandom(1,3) to the player's damage can go a long way toward helping the game's balance.",
