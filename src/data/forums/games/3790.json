How it works is that when you're totally lost in Dream Valley, you can activate this system and select any location you want to find and it'll find the quickest route there.  This will take place of the iconic map screen of &quot;My Little Time Killer&quot;... and it's much cooler and awesome! \n\nThe second (yet first to giving me a headache) is the addition of a fifth pane that is used for &quot;Equipment&quot;.  This pane is right below the Inventory pane, and it contains the pathfinder I just mentioned, your potions, sets of armor, weapons, and spoils of battle.  It'll save a ton of space on-screen now that you can have quest items and equipment separate without some giant list.\n\nSo thank you jaynabonne for putting up with my lackluster programming as I'm getting &quot;Welcome to Dream Valley&quot; together.\n\nUPDATE:  These features are now in the DEMO!",
