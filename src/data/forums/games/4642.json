So far there are 186 pages in it, and a print-out in word would of one of the solutions covers around 32 pages (almost 12,000 words, I am copying into word from time to time for the spellchecking etc). I have gone through things a bit, and while I am still discovering the odd bug, I am slowly feeling more confident that it seems to work the way its supposed to. \n\nThe game has a rudimentary combat system, and uses a fair amount of scripting to make sure the player can do certain things if he has met certain people or carried out some actions. I am planning to expand more on the combat system, but also want to get a feel of what people think about it. \n\nIn terms of layout the game allows the player to move more or less freely around various star-systems, attempting to discover who has blown up a warpgate that connects this sector to the &quot;wider Empire&quot;.\n\nNow, I would like to ask whoever would be happy to please provide feedback on the following lines:\n\n-What did you think were the interesting/boring parts of the game?\n-Which planets/areas/concepts do you think would be nice to develop further?\n-Is the game too hard/easy?\n-How long did it take you to finish it?\n-Comments of my writing style?\n-Is the layout confusing/do you &quot;get lost&quot; in the game?\n-Obviously, would be nice if you could report any bugs and grammar mistakes, typos, etc\n\nI still probably need a few more days with it, though I thought I would send this out today to see if there are any volunteers?",
