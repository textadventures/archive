Of course i try to use as many already existing objects i can get, but even this takes time to find victorian stuff and make it useable)\n5) get, learn and use a render application for the lighting of each location\n6) use photoshop for the final touches of each pic\n\nYou see, this alone is a lot (quantity) of work for one person alone, and any help would be appreciated.\nBut I think the effort will be worth it, as the result will then be that you can literally &quot;smell the tobacco in Baker Street&quot;, rather than a text-only description like &quot;you are trapped in castle, and dont know who you are...&quot; (no offense to other games).\n\nSo again, any constructive support or contribution is welcome, feel free to contact me. \nYou can also support the progress of the game by helping me with ongoing questions/tasks regarding Quest.",
