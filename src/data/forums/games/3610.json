The hero really shoots overboard, suddenly you're super powerful and can controll all elementals. I felt that was a little bit too much and over the top.

      "EditableText": "I just started playing it (only just rescued Dave) and I do agree that the game isn't really defined from the beginning. The fact that it's standard text adventure fodder is fine really, especially if it's part of a gradual ease in to the more complicated or specific features of the game. I believe that any game should begin based on assumption that the player knows nothing, and have something to demonstrate the concept to someone who's had little or no IF experience. In that respect, the starting room where you have to find your slippers is quite appropriate.\n\nThe problem as I see it is before that. You are asked to select an aspect and colour having no idea what these are. There's no prologue about the world, who you are, and what your immediate objective is. It's not just this game, a lot of IF games seem to just throw you into a world with no explanation or objective. I know part of the fun is exploring the world to gain more information about the backstory and such but I still think there should be something to begin with. There are many ways to do it, prologues, more objects in the starting room that elucidate on what you're doing, look at self, etc. along with 2 objectives. An immediate one (like make your way to the library where you left something, meet a friend on the other side of the village, etc. whatever is appropriate) and the game winning objective, whatever that may be, I don't know, I haven't finished yet.\n\nAnother thing I'd suggest with the game is more implementation of synonyms and objects. To use the first room as an example, there's moonlight, but &quot;x moon&quot; does nothing. &quot;x window&quot; describes the moon coming through it, so you could just have &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;moonlight&quot; as synonyms for the window to cut down on extraneous scenery objects yet still have them implemented.\n\nMy final request would be an abbreviated option of the command &quot;look around.&quot; At least for me, it's used frequently enough to become annoying.\n\nI hope this comes across as constructive criticism because I'm not trying to be overly negative even though reading over it it sounds like it. I'll keep playing through and get back to you with a more informed opinion once I'm further in.\n_____\n\nI tried out the other 2 spring thing entries. The one that won I didn't play past a couple of pages, but that's just my personal preference. I don't really like gamebooks and would even go as far to suggest that they should be judged separately from text adventure style games as they really are quite different. Especially since there seems to be a heavy bias towards these types of games in judging because it's harder for such a game to do something wrong.

      "HTML": "I just started playing it (only just rescued Dave) and I do agree that the game isn't really defined from the beginning. The fact that it's standard text adventure fodder is fine really, especially if it's part of a gradual ease in to the more complicated or specific features of the game. I believe that any game should begin based on assumption that the player knows nothing, and have something to demonstrate the concept to someone who's had little or no IF experience. In that respect, the starting room where you have to find your slippers is quite appropriate.<br/><br/>The problem as I see it is before that. You are asked to select an aspect and colour having no idea what these are. There's no prologue about the world, who you are, and what your immediate objective is. It's not just this game, a lot of IF games seem to just throw you into a world with no explanation or objective. I know part of the fun is exploring the world to gain more information about the backstory and such but I still think there should be something to begin with. There are many ways to do it, prologues, more objects in the starting room that elucidate on what you're doing, look at self, etc. along with 2 objectives. An immediate one (like make your way to the library where you left something, meet a friend on the other side of the village, etc. whatever is appropriate) and the game winning objective, whatever that may be, I don't know, I haven't finished yet.<br/><br/>Another thing I'd suggest with the game is more implementation of synonyms and objects. To use the first room as an example, there's moonlight, but &quot;x moon&quot; does nothing. &quot;x window&quot; describes the moon coming through it, so you could just have &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;moonlight&quot; as synonyms for the window to cut down on extraneous scenery objects yet still have them implemented.<br/><br/>My final request would be an abbreviated option of the command &quot;look around.&quot; At least for me, it's used frequently enough to become annoying.<br/><br/>I hope this comes across as constructive criticism because I'm not trying to be overly negative even though reading over it it sounds like it. I'll keep playing through and get back to you with a more informed opinion once I'm further in.<br/>_____<br/><br/>I tried out the other 2 spring thing entries. The one that won I didn't play past a couple of pages, but that's just my personal preference. I don't really like gamebooks and would even go as far to suggest that they should be judged separately from text adventure style games as they really are quite different.

The early timer trap ending the game for me as I tried to free the trapped guy was a bit of a shock, and were it not for my pure stubborn streak I might have thought hmm, that's enough for me.
