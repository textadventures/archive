Having done that, when I clicked &quot;back&quot;, it took me back from the Disclaimer. But when I clicked &quot;Back&quot; again to get back to the main menu, it went back to the disclaimer instead. In other words, &quot;back&quot; literally does a back. I think you want the &quot;Back&quot; at that first submenu to always go back to the main menu, not where you were before.\n\nSecond, as a general comment, you need to watch this shifting between present and past tenses. I have seen it before when I used to help people with prose. We have a natural tendency to speak in past tense, and it's tricky to maintain present tense. That's not to say it can't be done - it just takes more effort!\n\nFor example, your first sentence is &quot;When you awoke, you first remember standing in an empty void.&quot; It should be &quot;when you awake&quot;. &quot;Awoke&quot; is past tense, but you're speaking in present tense. Similarly:\n-  &quot;You try to move your fingers, but they were at rest &quot; should be &quot;You try to move your fingers, but they are at rest&quot; \n- &quot;your eyes are fixed upon the desolate horizon, as if it was expecting something&quot; should be &quot;your eyes are fixed upon the desolate horizon, as if it is expecting something&quot; (or &quot;were&quot;)\n- &quot;But you didn't move a muscle&quot; should be &quot;But you don't move a muscle&quot;\n- &quot;You didn't have any courage to protest&quot; should be &quot;You don't have any courage to protest&quot;\n- And more: &quot;You did not look calm. But you took deep breaths and you finally calmed down&quot; should be &quot;You do not look calm. But you take deep breaths and you finally calm down.\n\nIt can be tricky to maintain the present tense voice, but it's critical!\n\nThe asking up front for name, age and gender is a bit of a pain - I just hope it comes to some sort of fruition later.\n\nOne final thing (for now): while I know &quot;&quot;But you've a world to save. Worlds, actually&quot; is technically correct, it just feels wrong to me. I would prefer &quot;But you have a world to save.
