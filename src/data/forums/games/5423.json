I have a basic combat system to add as well, a transformation system to finish and add, and one other thing to add, and then I have to go back through and add in all the little details to make each play-through unique to whatever the player chooses in the creation. Simply put, the Goblin House is just the starting/tutorial area to get the player used to Quest and how the game works. Things will move much faster however once I have all the systems in place. This is actually a remake of my first game (which starts a couple hours before the first game did) so once I get the player out of the Goblin House (tutorial area), I already have a whole mess of content written and waiting (I'll just have to tweak things to fit all the new engines I've included).\n\nHopefully by 1.0, the Goblin House tutorial area will be finished and I'll be moving onto the second half of the game. I'm not sure how big of a game Quest can handle though without crashing! As the game stands now there are at least 68-72k words and 460 pages in word of code. \n\nThe original game that this one is being remade from was 224 pages and 38k words --- and isn't nearly as in depth of this one. So I think added together we're looking at a pretty sizable game!",

      "EditableText": "v0.9.8.2 is now live! Enjoy! Here's the changelog. \n\n1344 pages and 305601 words!\n\n\n\nv0.9.8.2 Changelog\n\n- Fixed not being able to “solve” the “Black Puzzle Box”. Sorry about that! Problem solved!\n- Fixed bracket’s appearing in the “Living Room” couch where variables are supposed to be! I also fixed a crap-ton of code errors, grammar mistakes and forgotten words in every single personality and outcome. I’m SO sorry for that sloppy mess. Don’t hold it against me too much though, it was one of the first times I was really coding with a lot of complicated text processor commands! Fixed another text processor command with the “Sexy” personality. I believe that should be all the problems with that event!\n- I cannot fix the “white side bars returning” on a loaded game. That is a problem with Quest --- a bug that is beyond my programming capabilities and most of the programmers on the site. The Quest creator, Alex will have to take a look at it and figure out what to do. But as soon as that is resolved this issue should be as well. UPDATE: Actually, Pertex may have solved one part of the issue. The “command bar” where you type has been returned to normal on the “load game” so I suggested a way to do the side-bars as well. We’ll see! The white side-bars have been fixed on load, so it shouldn’t do it anymore. \n- Fixed “backpack” still having carry issues, it also takes up inventory space. I also increased the player carry limit to “10” instead of “8”. If this doesn’t fix the backpack issue, I may go back to the drawing board with it. No sense in beating a dead horse!\n- Fixed curtains in the “Guest Bed-Room” and “Bathroom”. - holy crap was this an ordeal. It took literally half a day of trying shit. Grr!\n- Fixed “Black Puzzle Box” script error. Fixed a period error as well. Fixed the Intelligence reset. \n- I think Quest has trouble returning a “0” as an attribute number, so I decided and fixed all relevant code (I think. I’m sure I missed one or two sequences somewhere that I’m not remembering) that you can’t have less than “1” in a particular attribute like: strength, defense, agility and intelligence specifically. \n- Changed the “backpack” open and close messages. I varied them depending on if you’re wearing it or not. \n- Rewrote and added some “Upstairs, Locked Door” messages.\n- Shortened the “Downstairs Bathroom” description in case the player “looks” twice. It’s much more tolerable now <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> I also switched the puzzle from the “Down Stairs, Toilet” to the “Upstairs, Tub” and added some little hints to help the player through it. Nothing substantial, just little nudges. Rewrote, the “Down Stairs” toilet “Flush” event. That should conclude the downstairs “Bathroom”. You can still gain +1 Agility for using the toilet too! Maybe later on I can add having to “pee” and “poo” variables if people really want it. We’ll see!\n- In both “Bathrooms” I lowered the chances of getting the first few hair-dyes. What I mean is, I lowered the chances from 25% to 15% --- this will enable a better chance for you to get some of the dyes lower down on the list like “neon” and “pastel” for example without inhibiting you to get the first few. I also added “dust” messages to them so you know they are safe to take without gaining corruption.\n- Started on the “Upstairs Bathroom”. Remastered/Rewrote the overall description so far. Same for the toilet. Added intelligence variables so far but nothing significant will be affected, just the player’s responses to things and “height” variables. Also, if you haven’t solved the puzzle of the downstairs bathroom and the toilet is still empty, the player will reference it! Neato! Rewrote/Remastered the sink now, which now takes your “height” into account. If you’re over 4’6 the description will change slightly. Created a flag variable for the water so if it’s turned on, it’ll appear in the description of the room and the object. \n- Added the tub and sink variables to the descriptions in the “Downstairs Bathroom’s” main description. \n- Fixed a lot of weird period and grammar flows/messages in both “Bathroom” areas when certain attributes are activated. \n- Modified the “Lock Messages” to the “Study” and the “Second Locked Door” Upstairs. They were bothering me, so I made them better. \n- Rewrote/Remastered the “Upstairs Bathroom” and all items/events therein. There are also many, many variables that change the descriptions of the room based on what’s happening and there are intelligence variables as well <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->. \n- The “Pale Abomination” in the “Study” is now attackable and will attack you ONSIGHT. He has 500 health and does about “8” damage per attack (when it hits). So make sure if you go into the “Study” that you’re ready to take some damage! This is where all that resting and whatnot comes in handy. You can see his current remaining life in his description. “Player Agility” and “Player Defense” are not in place yet either so you’ll receive no damage reduction. Be careful! Its description has been completely rewritten/remastered and has personality variables (the grotesque description is severely toned down in the “Sympathy Personality” and the “Sarcasm Personality” has a lot of swearing but the description remains mostly consistent across the other “Personalities”). If you managed to defeat it there is a variable that will be added to conversations and if you manage to see it, then that will have a variable as well. I removed the “cannot fight” the Pale Abomination message. I added in a little something too if you’re “Horny” when you walk in! You’ll lose your “Horny” status and -1 Lust (the first time) because of how hideous it is. There are also variables scattered throughout the description and items inside based on whether or not it’s dead, including when you leave the room.\n- Reduced player strength effects in terms of battle to help balance things out so this’ll be a trial run. Basically, take your strength divide by 5 and then add +1 and that’s how much you’ll hit for. Add weapon damage to that number to find out your attack with weapons. I increased critical chance per attack well. But we’ll see how it goes once I’m able to test it. “Defense” and “Agility” are now calculated into the combat! But again, I haven’t tested it yet, so we’ll have to see how it goes! \n- Began Remastering/Rewriting the main “Study” description. Finished the “Eastern Bookcase” main description remaster/rewrite. I also added in “Intelligence” variables; “15” or more will warn you not to touch the books, “14” or less will encourage it! You can now summon and fight the “Male Minotaur” as well. He has 150 health and hits about the same as the “Pale Abomination”, “8” damage or so, depending on your “Defense”. You can see his current health by checking his description. I remastered/rewrote the “Eastern Bookshelves” and all the search messages associated with it. There are also intelligence variables. I added the Master Bedroom as a potential teleportation in case players either missed the opportunity to get inside or wanted another chance to see what’s in there (currently nothing) <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> but eventually stuff! It’s also the hardest “chance” to get (still 25% but at the bottom of the list). Added “Personality” influences on the Minotaur’s description, so it’ll be different depending on your “Personality”. I Remastered/Rewrote the “Maple Desk” main description, the “Search” event of the “Top Drawer” and the main description, the “Bottom Drawer” main description, it’s “Search” event and the “Spellbook” find description. Began Rewriting/Remastering the “Western Bookcase”. I also separated the main descriptions depending on what “Personality” you are; “Sexy” and “Sarcasm” have sexual innuendo and books based around sex, “Sympathy” has descriptions about confidence and self-help, and the “Serious” Personality has books that relate to the Geography of “Auvora” and the “Auvora Map”. The “Maple Desk” and it’s “Drawers” have been completely remastered/rewritten. The “Spell Book” no longer auto-appears in your inventory, but can be taken at your own leisure. Began work on Remastering/Rewriting the “Southern Window Curtains” main description. They also can now be “Opened” and “Closed” as well. This will change the main room’s description and [SPOILER] cause “50 damage” toward the Pale Abomination and lower its overall attack by “1”! [END SPOILER]. The First Time open is based on a number of factors; intelligence rating and whether or not the Pale Abomination is dead. If your intelligence is low and the Abomination is alive, when you open the curtains there is a mini-comic event where you and the Abomination are pretty much incapacitated for a few moments and if you your intelligence is high, you more or less use the light against the Abomination without making a fool of yourself in the process! If the Abomination is dead and you open the curtains with a low intelligence you again unlock a little mini-comical event. If your intelligence is high you just open the curtains and gaze out at the “Withering Forest”. I removed the “Phallic-Lamp” from the Study seeing as it wasn’t adding anything to the room. I did plan on having it harm the “Pale Abomination” but I think it would cause conflicting scripts that I just didn’t feel like messing with. Started the Rewrite/Remaster of the “Expensive Rug”; it’s description will vary depending on what personality you are. Like always, “Sexy” and “Sarcasm” will take a more sexy and humorous approach, the “Sympathy” one will be a sweet image and the “Serious” personality will reflect something from the game’s world (actually it’s foreshadowing in the game’s story). There is also a “light” variable, so if you look at the carpet in the dark without opening the curtains, you won’t be able to see what’s there. Most of the main descriptions are the same too except for the image portrayed on the carpet! I remastered the “Search” event too and made the “Gold” there a chance find now. There’s a 45% chance you’ll get it <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->! The “Eastern Trophies” have been renamed “Front Wall Trophies” and have their main descriptions entirely remastered/rewritten; there are also two variables for the description: height and MHON. As far as the “Search Event” goes, I’ve decided that searching the Back Trophy case automatically allows you to find the “Desk Key” 100% of the time (if there is a certain variable met! See if you can figure it out [SPOILER] You have to open the curtains first and the light from them allows you to notice the gleam of the key when you search it again [END SPOILER]). The reason for this is, before it was 65% and really wasn’t far for people who figured out the other parts of the puzzle only to make it into the “Study” and then be denied the prize. Plus, you can’t solve the “Upstairs Bathroom” puzzle without the “Spellbook” and without the “Desk Key” you can’t get the book. So it’s kind of a reward for getting all the way there and finding it in the trophy case ! I also lowered the chance of finding “Gold” there which was originally 65%, now it’s down to 25%. The “North-Western Trophies” have been renamed “Back-Western Trophies” and had their main description remastered/rewritten. There is a MHON variable and a height variable as well. I remastered/rewrote the “Search” Events for that trophy-case too; and lowered the gold you find there, down from 10 gold to 5 gold and 10 gold altogether, if you have the “Big Saver” speciality. Began the remaster/rewrite of the “Western Trophy Collection” which has been renamed “Display Case”. I removed the “Search” Event for it, since it wasn’t contributing anything to the overall exploration of the room, just more of the same that the other two trophies did a better job of portraying. Instead, the “Display Case” will just have a remastered/rewritten main description for your viewing pleasure. I added a new “Solve” verb for the “Display Case” which is a complicated set of code. If you know the lock’s combination, you can open it and if you choose too, you can steal an item from it, but you will gain +4 “Corruption” if you do (since none of them are covered in dust). The four items are: “An Heirloom Diamond Engagement Ring”, “An Heirloom Urn”, “An Heirloom Pearl Necklace”, and an “Expensive Heirloom Plate” all with a 25% chance. Be careful though! You only get one shot to take something from the case if you decide to open it. The other way of opening it is if you have at least “6” “Thief Skill” in which a prompt will come up if you fail to open it asking if you want to pick the lock instead. If you choose “No” you can come back to it later or try the combination again. If you say “Yes” then you’ll have an 80% chance to succeed. If you don’t, you’re welcome to try again, but you’ll gain +3 “Corruption”. If you succeed, you’ll be asked if you still want to take something from the “Display Case” if you choose “No”, nothing will happen and you’ll lose your opportunity to take something. If you choose “Yes” you have a 25% chance to get one of the items mentioned above, as well as +10 “Corruption” (“6” for picking the lock, “4” for actually stealing the item since none of them are covered in dust). Started rewriting/remastering the “Western Bookcase”, “Search” Event. First thing I did is remove the player only being able to transform themselves once; you can now do it multiple times if you want and turn yourself into some kind of weird chimera if you want! Fun for the whole family! Also, it is now “Personality” based, meaning each personality will (eventually) have their own take on the transformations. I also added “Resist” transitions throughout each of the sections that you can possibly get: -1, -2, -3 and then when you have “0” “Resist” you have a “yes” or “no” choice about whether you want to resist a certain transformation or not. There are at least eight variations of this too. Anyway, if you want to try, you have a 25% chance to “Resist” the transformation otherwise it happens against your will. So I finished the “breast increase and decrease”, “hip increase and decrease”, “nails increase and decrease”, “butt increase and decrease”, “lips increase and decrease” so far on the “no” side of the question. I don’t think the “yes” side will have a ton more variation, but it’ll be different leading into the transformations at the very least if your unlucky (or lucky enough maybe) to get them. We’ll see though. Also, there are a million variables; just about all of them made it in so far and multiple variables per scenario. Some will even give or take away “Lust” as well depending on your “personality” and the outcome of the transformation. \n- Lowered the backpack’s carry limit from 20 to 13. Lowered player’s carry limit from 10 to 2. Clothing no longer carry’s weight or volume, so carry as much of that as you want. Added a message indicating the player’s current max carry in the player description at the bottom. You have to equip the bags you have otherwise you do not gain the carry increase (for the main carry items like the backpack and the belt pouch). For items like the sacks and bottles, when you take them it’ll auto increase your inventory carry but when you drop them they will subtract your carry limit. Let’s see how all of that works out. \n- Lowered the “Journal” weight/volume. “2” down to “1”  \n- I added a new description to all the remastered spaces/rooms so far. They all have to do with surrounding scents or aromas that the player should/will be smelling. I thought doing this might add more immersion ^_^ \n- I added in a bit of code that will allow you to “look” and “lookat” things in the usual manner without taking up a turn so that means if you want to look at enemies or scenery then you’ll be free to do so without getting your arse kicked all over the place. I also added this to the “Pillage” feature as well. I’m working on having the enemies of the game-skip one global turn before attacking you. For example, right now as you enter a room they immediately start pummeling you, I want to give the player a chance to get their barring straight before messing around with a room. So working on that! Although it’s not working at the moment. Working on it! Got it working. \n- Lowered “Wool Blanket” volume/weight “5” down to “3”. Lowered the “Fleece Blanket” weight/volume “4” down to “3”. Removed weight/volume from all “Face-cloths”. Lowered all “Towel” weight/volume “2” down to “1”. “Torn Cloth” has had its weight/volume completely removed. The “Oil Cartridge” volume/weight has been reduced “2” down to “1”. Removed the “Sexy Candle” weight/volume completely and did the same for “Rold’s Box”. Anything “Quest Related” won’t be a penalty for the player from now on. Removed the “Black Puzzle Box” weight/volume. I figure it’s small enough and pieces are constantly falling off of it. There wouldn’t be much to it! “Fresh Water” and “Dirty Water” have had their volumes/weight removed. I figure meh. All “Equippable Weapons” carry their respectable weights. Minimum Player Weight/Volume Carry has been increased “2” up to “3” so you can carry any of the current available weapons! \n- More or less fixed all of the “Sack” items. The “Small” and “Medium” --- “Loot” event was broken! \n- Fixed the “File” event for the “Expensive Nail File”\n- Fixed an elusive period. \n- Fixed player damage. I hit for 203 &gt;_&gt;; Non-critical LOL. Destroyed that fking zombie though! Fixed player critical and adjusted it again and again. \n- After some more “Backpack” debacle you can no longer “Open”, “Close” or “Put Things” inside of “Containers” Their only purpose is to increase your inventory Carry Capacity. We’ll see how that works. I added in a message reminding players of the two different “Container” types; wearable and inventory. \n- Removed the “Waterskin” from the Backpack parent and made it appear in the “Waterhole” instead.\n- Fixed an arithmetic error that was happening with the game’s major turn-script  \n- Made it so the player cannot move if they are carrying too much weight  \n- Fixed missing period in the “Gameover” scene. \n- Added some messages to the player description about how to manage your carried or wearable containers; like dropping them and removing them etc. \n- I think I actually fixed the “waterskin” dropping “dirty” and “fresh” water when “closed” by removing it from the backpack. So …hurrah! I’ve tested it a few times now. \n- Created a second window pane exclusive made to hold “Container” objects so they won’t clog your inventory. Still trying to get it to work! \n- Removed the “Take” verb from the “East Hallway Closet”, “Search” items: ie. towel, face cloths and blankets. \n- The player can now become immobilized! It’ll only happen during scripted events I think though! So no worries  Oh! It’ll also happen if you’re carrying too much. \n- The “Backpack” and “Belt Pouch” are no longer “wearable”. Just having them in your inventory will increase your “Carry Capacity”!\n- Removed the “Belt Pouch” and the “Backpack” giving a “Serious Personality Point”. \n- Adjusted the new “Carry Capacity” description in the player description to reflect the changes above about them being non-wearable and wearable.\n- Removed the “Second Pane” I was implementing simply because it made things a little too complicated and it wasn’t necessary. I will have to think of something else.\n- Added a new “Skill” – “Thief Skill”! Which you can increase throughout the course of the game. Everyone but Thieves and Black Smith Assistants start at “0”, Thieves start with “6” and BSA starts with “3”. The max is “10” and how it’ll work is if you approach a “locked door” or “locked chest” or something like that, if you have a high enough “Thief Skill” you can unlock it. Pretty nifty, eh? I haven’t come up with ways to increase that number yet, but I’m sure I’ll come up with something. BTW, picking locks even as a thief raises your corruption by the requirement of the Thief Skill indicated (meaning if it takes a “4” to unlock, it’ll raise your corruption by “4” if you succeed and half that if you fail), so…do so at your own discretion! The “Thief Skill” has been added to the player description as well. With that said, every puzzle and treasure chest WILL always have a key, a combination or a way to get inside. But just in case you don’t find it, the “ThiefSkill” will be a secondary option. Also, thieving won’t ALWAYS work. There will be a high chance though if you have a high enough “Thief Skill” in the first place (like 80%). With every success though you have a chance to increase your “Thief Skill” by + “1” \n- You can now force open the “Master Bedroom” lock if you have a Thief Skill of at least “6” or greater. You can now force open the “Study” lock if you have a Thief Skill of at least “6” or greater. If you have the key you will automatically discard it afterward, if you acquire it later, you’ll keep it and don’t use it, you’ll keep it until you enter the “Study”. I added a message letting you know that as well. You cannot force open the Secondary Bedroom or Rold’s Lab. Since those are story related ^_~\n- Created a non-droppable, “Storage” holder for all your “Containers” which can be “opened” and “closed” to save inventory space! All storage containers will automatically be moved into it once you take them. \n- Created a non-droppable, “Worn Clothing” storage for all “worn” clothing, which can be “opened” and “closed” to save inventory space. All worn clothing will automatically be moved into it once you wear them. Although, I’ll need to extensively test this to see if it’ll even work. Wish it luck! Okay, so it works! except for one minor detail, the player cannot remove clothing once it’s stored in there. I’m sure there’s a simple code to fix it though! ^_^;; for removing it from the “Worn Clothing” container once it’s removed, which again is a very simple code. Except for a small coding issue I’m working on which allows the player to double wear clothing when the container is closed. It should be resolved soon though. \n- Removed the “test female zombie” from the starting area! As well as the “pregnancy dildo”! Though as more pregnancy stuff goes into the game I’ll put it back for testing purposes. \n- Made it so the thief skill values cannot go over “10” or under “1”.\n- Added four new items: each with a unique description: “Locking Picking Guide #1”, “Locking Picking Guide #2”, “Locking Picking Guide #3” and “Locking Picking Guide #4”. Basically, “using” them will increase your “Thief Skill” as long as you aren’t already passed the parameters of each book. The first book will increase you no higher than “2”, The second book will increase you no higher than “4”, the third book will increase you no higher than “6” and the last book will increase you no higher than “8”. The remaining “9” and “10” must be accomplished through actual lock picking, but it’s possible (if you find the guides enough) to increase your score from 1 to 8 without ever gaining an ounce of corruption. \n- Added a new item: “Expensive Plate” which can be looted from the “Display Case” in the “Study”. It has a unique description and if you’re carrying the “Spellbook” it will increase your damage by +1 while you’re carrying it. Although, it does hum with magical energy and is a Picksnap heirloom…\n- Added a new item: “Urn” which can be looted from the “Display Case” in the “Study”. It has a unique description and if you’re carrying the “Spellbook” it will increase your damage +2 (as long as you’re carrying it). It does hum with a lot of magical energy though and is a Picksnap heirloom as well…\n- Added a new item: “Heirloom Ring” which can be looted from the “Display Case” in the “Study”. It has a unique description and if you’re carrying the “Spellbook” it’ll increase your damage +1. This is a wearable item that goes on your finger (obviously). You can only wear one ring at a time  This particular one increases your “Sexy Points” by +1. \n- Added a new item: “Pearl Necklace” which can be looted from the “Display Case” in the “Study”. It has a unique description and if you’re carrying the “Spellbook” it’ll increase your damage by +1. This is a wearable item that goes around your neck. You can only wear one necklace at a time as well. This item also increases your “Sympathy Points” by +1. \n- Added 4 more “Clothing Slots”: Finger, Bracelet, Necklace and Ankle. They aren’t in the player description as of right now however.\n- Added 12 “Tattoo Slots”: Neck, Left Shoulder, Right Shoulder, Right Bicep, Left Bicep, Left Forearm, Right Forearm, Lower Back, Hip, Buttcheeks, Left Calf and Right Calf.\n- Added what “Body Slot” the Clothing Items take up. It’s listed in their descriptions.\n- I removed “Clothing Size Parameters” for the time being and have added subsequent descriptions regarding sizes that are too large  Basically, the only time clothing parameters will apply is when you have transformed something about yourself that cannot fit into clothing of that standard, for example, hooves with boots and so on. As for the old parameters, when you reach the larger sizes, the descriptions will begin to repeat, letting you know that you’ve surpassed that item’s comfortable size. Hope you guys like the new system!\n- Added the player’s “neck” to the player’s description as well as the “Pearl Necklace”. \n- Added the player’s “finger” to the player’s description as well as the “Diamond Heirloom Ring”\n- Added “labels” to your thieving expertise in the player description. \n- Added some revamped description to the player “tail” descriptions, if they happen to have one and added “Horny” variables to it and gender as well (but only for females). \n- Added some “horny” variables to the player’s breast/moob descriptions in the player description. So it’ll change a little if you’re horny or not, also fixed some minor spacing errors and changed a few lines in the “Horny” description in the “Lust” section of the player description.  \n- Changed the requirement for “lustful” eyes in the player description from “6” down to “4”. \n- Added the “Fashionable” Speciality stats to ALL current wearable items; meaning you get double stats from anything you put on (including personality). Modified the “Fashionable” Speciality description as well in the “Character Creator”.\n- Added 12 “Piercing Slots”: Left Ear Lobe, Right Ear Lobe, Upper Ears, Nose, Tongue, Eyebrow (left or right), Lip, Secondary Mouth (like snake bites, angel bites etc), Navel, Nipples, Genitals, and Back. ((How these will work is let’s use the “nose” for an example; if you get your nose “Pierced” you can wear any “nose gear” but only “1” of that type. Like a ring, or a septum item, or a nose stud, or a third eye --- etc.)) **I changed it to 11 “Piercing Slots” by combining “left earlobe” and “right earlobe” into just “earlobe” referring to both. But there will still be items that cover just one side if you’re interested in that!\n- Added “Resist” to the player’s arsenal. “Resist” as you have probably guessed helps you resist things like instant transformations. For example, if you open a box and get blasted with some type of transformation spell, if you happen to have some “Resist” your character will be able to fight the transformation from happening and therefore remain unchanged. If you have no “Resist” left, well, all transformations are fair game. You have “3” Resists total before you run out of them. What happens after that? Simple! Just resting/sleeping in the game will completely recharge them. Also, “Cursed” clothing is NOT affected by “Resist”. If you have some “Cursed” outfit on, you’re on your own! “Decursers” are the only way to stop those particular transformations  Hope you guys like that!\n- Added “Resist” to the player description just below your “Carry Capacity”. \n- I went back through and completely rewrote all of the player descriptions AND added piercing descriptions within all of as well so that it flowed as smoothly as possible. That literally took an entire day. Now to test it for bugs! So there were several bugs, all of which have been addressed and fixed. I also fixed a few spelling errors, punctuation mistakes and all that fun stuff! Seems very good now and reads smoothly with or without piercings. Also, the “centaur” transformations are less “horsy” now. Meaning you’ll retail a humanoid face, you’ll just have like horse ears and a horse body and so on. \n- Fixed a “fashionable” speciality error that had to do with doubling the stats. I forgot the quotes  \n- Confirmed that the “Lab Key” is indeed working properly. \n- Took another day messing around with the new “Carry System” (Pix helped me with the problem). The system was counting objects/items with a volume of “0” as weight. As a result, even carrying 3 objects with 0 volume was keeping the playing from moving. Now there’s one other issue to solve…\n- Simplified some of the coding for all changeable attributes; now you can be less than or greater than their “current” maximum amounts like: hairlength, height, weight etc. I did that so I could code items and events much faster without having to worry about accounting for things being too long or growing and shrinking beyond the current parameters.\n- Fixed a small “Carry” problem  Everything should be working 100%. Except that double wear issue. \n- Added a new message to the “Waterskin” about how to fill it and open it.  A lot of people were having issues with that apparently.",
      "EditableFormat": "bbcode",
      "HTML": "v0.9.8.2 is now live! Enjoy! Here's the changelog. <br/><br/>1344 pages and 305601 words!<br/><br/><br/><br/>v0.9.8.2 Changelog<br/><br/>- Fixed not being able to “solve” the “Black Puzzle Box”. Sorry about that! Problem solved!<br/>- Fixed bracket’s appearing in the “Living Room” couch where variables are supposed to be! I also fixed a crap-ton of code errors, grammar mistakes and forgotten words in every single personality and outcome. I’m SO sorry for that sloppy mess. Don’t hold it against me too much though, it was one of the first times I was really coding with a lot of complicated text processor commands! Fixed another text processor command with the “Sexy” personality. I believe that should be all the problems with that event!<br/>- I cannot fix the “white side bars returning” on a loaded game. That is a problem with Quest --- a bug that is beyond my programming capabilities and most of the programmers on the site. The Quest creator, Alex will have to take a look at it and figure out what to do. But as soon as that is resolved this issue should be as well. UPDATE: Actually, Pertex may have solved one part of the issue. The “command bar” where you type has been returned to normal on the “load game” so I suggested a way to do the side-bars as well. We’ll see! The white side-bars have been fixed on load, so it shouldn’t do it anymore. <br/>- Fixed “backpack” still having carry issues, it also takes up inventory space. I also increased the player carry limit to “10” instead of “8”. If this doesn’t fix the backpack issue, I may go back to the drawing board with it. No sense in beating a dead horse!<br/>- Fixed curtains in the “Guest Bed-Room” and “Bathroom”. - holy crap was this an ordeal. It took literally half a day of trying shit. Grr!<br/>- Fixed “Black Puzzle Box” script error. Fixed a period error as well. Fixed the Intelligence reset. <br/>- I think Quest has trouble returning a “0” as an attribute number, so I decided and fixed all relevant code (I think. I’m sure I missed one or two sequences somewhere that I’m not remembering) that you can’t have less than “1” in a particular attribute like: strength, defense, agility and intelligence specifically. <br/>- Changed the “backpack” open and close messages. I varied them depending on if you’re wearing it or not. <br/>- Rewrote and added some “Upstairs, Locked Door” messages.<br/>- Shortened the “Downstairs Bathroom” description in case the player “looks” twice. It’s much more tolerable now <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D --> I also switched the puzzle from the “Down Stairs, Toilet” to the “Upstairs, Tub” and added some little hints to help the player through it. Nothing substantial, just little nudges. Rewrote, the “Down Stairs” toilet “Flush” event. That should conclude the downstairs “Bathroom”. You can still gain +1 Agility for using the toilet too! Maybe later on I can add having to “pee” and “poo” variables if people really want it. We’ll see!<br/>- In both “Bathrooms” I lowered the chances of getting the first few hair-dyes. What I mean is, I lowered the chances from 25% to 15% --- this will enable a better chance for you to get some of the dyes lower down on the list like “neon” and “pastel” for example without inhibiting you to get the first few. I also added “dust” messages to them so you know they are safe to take without gaining corruption.<br/>- Started on the “Upstairs Bathroom”. Remastered/Rewrote the overall description so far. Same for the toilet. Added intelligence variables so far but nothing significant will be affected, just the player’s responses to things and “height” variables. Also, if you haven’t solved the puzzle of the downstairs bathroom and the toilet is still empty, the player will reference it! Neato! Rewrote/Remastered the sink now, which now takes your “height” into account. If you’re over 4’6 the description will change slightly. Created a flag variable for the water so if it’s turned on, it’ll appear in the description of the room and the object. <br/>- Added the tub and sink variables to the descriptions in the “Downstairs Bathroom’s” main description. <br/>- Fixed a lot of weird period and grammar flows/messages in both “Bathroom” areas when certain attributes are activated. <br/>- Modified the “Lock Messages” to the “Study” and the “Second Locked Door” Upstairs. They were bothering me, so I made them better. <br/>- Rewrote/Remastered the “Upstairs Bathroom” and all items/events therein. There are also many, many variables that change the descriptions of the room based on what’s happening and there are intelligence variables as well <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->. <br/>- The “Pale Abomination” in the “Study” is now attackable and will attack you ONSIGHT. He has 500 health and does about “8” damage per attack (when it hits). So make sure if you go into the “Study” that you’re ready to take some damage! This is where all that resting and whatnot comes in handy. You can see his current remaining life in his description. “Player Agility” and “Player Defense” are not in place yet either so you’ll receive no damage reduction. Be careful! Its description has been completely rewritten/remastered and has personality variables (the grotesque description is severely toned down in the “Sympathy Personality” and the “Sarcasm Personality” has a lot of swearing but the description remains mostly consistent across the other “Personalities”). If you managed to defeat it there is a variable that will be added to conversations and if you manage to see it, then that will have a variable as well. I removed the “cannot fight” the Pale Abomination message. I added in a little something too if you’re “Horny” when you walk in! You’ll lose your “Horny” status and -1 Lust (the first time) because of how hideous it is. There are also variables scattered throughout the description and items inside based on whether or not it’s dead, including when you leave the room.<br/>- Reduced player strength effects in terms of battle to help balance things out so this’ll be a trial run. Basically, take your strength divide by 5 and then add +1 and that’s how much you’ll hit for. Add weapon damage to that number to find out your attack with weapons. I increased critical chance per attack well. But we’ll see how it goes once I’m able to test it. “Defense” and “Agility” are now calculated into the combat! But again, I haven’t tested it yet, so we’ll have to see how it goes! <br/>- Began Remastering/Rewriting the main “Study” description. Finished the “Eastern Bookcase” main description remaster/rewrite. I also added in “Intelligence” variables; “15” or more will warn you not to touch the books, “14” or less will encourage it! You can now summon and fight the “Male Minotaur” as well. He has 150 health and hits about the same as the “Pale Abomination”, “8” damage or so, depending on your “Defense”. You can see his current health by checking his description. I remastered/rewrote the “Eastern Bookshelves” and all the search messages associated with it. There are also intelligence variables. I added the Master Bedroom as a potential teleportation in case players either missed the opportunity to get inside or wanted another chance to see what’s in there (currently nothing) <!-- s:P --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /><!-- s:P --> but eventually stuff! It’s also the hardest “chance” to get (still 25% but at the bottom of the list). Added “Personality” influences on the Minotaur’s description, so it’ll be different depending on your “Personality”. I Remastered/Rewrote the “Maple Desk” main description, the “Search” event of the “Top Drawer” and the main description, the “Bottom Drawer” main description, it’s “Search” event and the “Spellbook” find description. Began Rewriting/Remastering the “Western Bookcase”. I also separated the main descriptions depending on what “Personality” you are; “Sexy” and “Sarcasm” have sexual innuendo and books based around sex, “Sympathy” has descriptions about confidence and self-help, and the “Serious” Personality has books that relate to the Geography of “Auvora” and the “Auvora Map”. The “Maple Desk” and it’s “Drawers” have been completely remastered/rewritten. The “Spell Book” no longer auto-appears in your inventory, but can be taken at your own leisure. Began work on Remastering/Rewriting the “Southern Window Curtains” main description. They also can now be “Opened” and “Closed” as well. This will change the main room’s description and [SPOILER] cause “50 damage” toward the Pale Abomination and lower its overall attack by “1”! [END SPOILER]. The First Time open is based on a number of factors; intelligence rating and whether or not the Pale Abomination is dead. If your intelligence is low and the Abomination is alive, when you open the curtains there is a mini-comic event where you and the Abomination are pretty much incapacitated for a few moments and if you your intelligence is high, you more or less use the light against the Abomination without making a fool of yourself in the process! If the Abomination is dead and you open the curtains with a low intelligence you again unlock a little mini-comical event. If your intelligence is high you just open the curtains and gaze out at the “Withering Forest”. I removed the “Phallic-Lamp” from the Study seeing as it wasn’t adding anything to the room. I did plan on having it harm the “Pale Abomination” but I think it would cause conflicting scripts that I just didn’t feel like messing with. Started the Rewrite/Remaster of the “Expensive Rug”; it’s description will vary depending on what personality you are. Like always, “Sexy” and “Sarcasm” will take a more sexy and humorous approach, the “Sympathy” one will be a sweet image and the “Serious” personality will reflect something from the game’s world (actually it’s foreshadowing in the game’s story). There is also a “light” variable, so if you look at the carpet in the dark without opening the curtains, you won’t be able to see what’s there. Most of the main descriptions are the same too except for the image portrayed on the carpet! I remastered the “Search” event too and made the “Gold” there a chance find now. There’s a 45% chance you’ll get it <!-- s:D --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><!-- s:D -->! The “Eastern Trophies” have been renamed “Front Wall Trophies” and have their main descriptions entirely remastered/rewritten; there are also two variables for the description: height and MHON. As far as the “Search Event” goes, I’ve decided that searching the Back Trophy case automatically allows you to find the “Desk Key” 100% of the time (if there is a certain variable met! See if you can figure it out [SPOILER] You have to open the curtains first and the light from them allows you to notice the gleam of the key when you search it again [END SPOILER]). The reason for this is, before it was 65% and really wasn’t far for people who figured out the other parts of the puzzle only to make it into the “Study” and then be denied the prize. Plus, you can’t solve the “Upstairs Bathroom” puzzle without the “Spellbook” and without the “Desk Key” you can’t get the book. So it’s kind of a reward for getting all the way there and finding it in the trophy case ! I also lowered the chance of finding “Gold” there which was originally 65%, now it’s down to 25%. The “North-Western Trophies” have been renamed “Back-Western Trophies” and had their main description remastered/rewritten. There is a MHON variable and a height variable as well. I remastered/rewrote the “Search” Events for that trophy-case too; and lowered the gold you find there, down from 10 gold to 5 gold and 10 gold altogether, if you have the “Big Saver” speciality. Began the remaster/rewrite of the “Western Trophy Collection” which has been renamed “Display Case”. I removed the “Search” Event for it, since it wasn’t contributing anything to the overall exploration of the room, just more of the same that the other two trophies did a better job of portraying. Instead, the “Display Case” will just have a remastered/rewritten main description for your viewing pleasure. I added a new “Solve” verb for the “Display Case” which is a complicated set of code. If you know the lock’s combination, you can open it and if you choose too, you can steal an item from it, but you will gain +4 “Corruption” if you do (since none of them are covered in dust). The four items are: “An Heirloom Diamond Engagement Ring”, “An Heirloom Urn”, “An Heirloom Pearl Necklace”, and an “Expensive Heirloom Plate” all with a 25% chance. Be careful though! You only get one shot to take something from the case if you decide to open it. The other way of opening it is if you have at least “6” “Thief Skill” in which a prompt will come up if you fail to open it asking if you want to pick the lock instead. If you choose “No” you can come back to it later or try the combination again. If you say “Yes” then you’ll have an 80% chance to succeed. If you don’t, you’re welcome to try again, but you’ll gain +3 “Corruption”. If you succeed, you’ll be asked if you still want to take something from the “Display Case” if you choose “No”, nothing will happen and you’ll lose your opportunity to take something. If you choose “Yes” you have a 25% chance to get one of the items mentioned above, as well as +10 “Corruption” (“6” for picking the lock, “4” for actually stealing the item since none of them are covered in dust). Started rewriting/remastering the “Western Bookcase”, “Search” Event. First thing I did is remove the player only being able to transform themselves once; you can now do it multiple times if you want and turn yourself into some kind of weird chimera if you want! Fun for the whole family! Also, it is now “Personality” based, meaning each personality will (eventually) have their own take on the transformations. I also added “Resist” transitions throughout each of the sections that you can possibly get: -1, -2, -3 and then when you have “0” “Resist” you have a “yes” or “no” choice about whether you want to resist a certain transformation or not. There are at least eight variations of this too. Anyway, if you want to try, you have a 25% chance to “Resist” the transformation otherwise it happens against your will. So I finished the “breast increase and decrease”, “hip increase and decrease”, “nails increase and decrease”, “butt increase and decrease”, “lips increase and decrease” so far on the “no” side of the question. I don’t think the “yes” side will have a ton more variation, but it’ll be different leading into the transformations at the very least if your unlucky (or lucky enough maybe) to get them. We’ll see though. Also, there are a million variables; just about all of them made it in so far and multiple variables per scenario. Some will even give or take away “Lust” as well depending on your “personality” and the outcome of the transformation. <br/>- Lowered the backpack’s carry limit from 20 to 13. Lowered player’s carry limit from 10 to 2. Clothing no longer carry’s weight or volume, so carry as much of that as you want. Added a message indicating the player’s current max carry in the player description at the bottom. You have to equip the bags you have otherwise you do not gain the carry increase (for the main carry items like the backpack and the belt pouch). For items like the sacks and bottles, when you take them it’ll auto increase your inventory carry but when you drop them they will subtract your carry limit. Let’s see how all of that works out. <br/>- Lowered the “Journal” weight/volume. “2” down to “1”  <br/>- I added a new description to all the remastered spaces/rooms so far. They all have to do with surrounding scents or aromas that the player should/will be smelling. I thought doing this might add more immersion ^_^ <br/>- I added in a bit of code that will allow you to “look” and “lookat” things in the usual manner without taking up a turn so that means if you want to look at enemies or scenery then you’ll be free to do so without getting your arse kicked all over the place. I also added this to the “Pillage” feature as well. I’m working on having the enemies of the game-skip one global turn before attacking you. For example, right now as you enter a room they immediately start pummeling you, I want to give the player a chance to get their barring straight before messing around with a room. So working on that! Although it’s not working at the moment. Working on it! Got it working. <br/>- Lowered “Wool Blanket” volume/weight “5” down to “3”. Lowered the “Fleece Blanket” weight/volume “4” down to “3”. Removed weight/volume from all “Face-cloths”. Lowered all “Towel” weight/volume “2” down to “1”. “Torn Cloth” has had its weight/volume completely removed. The “Oil Cartridge” volume/weight has been reduced “2” down to “1”. Removed the “Sexy Candle” weight/volume completely and did the same for “Rold’s Box”. Anything “Quest Related” won’t be a penalty for the player from now on. Removed the “Black Puzzle Box” weight/volume. I figure it’s small enough and pieces are constantly falling off of it. There wouldn’t be much to it! “Fresh Water” and “Dirty Water” have had their volumes/weight removed. I figure meh. All “Equippable Weapons” carry their respectable weights. Minimum Player Weight/Volume Carry has been increased “2” up to “3” so you can carry any of the current available weapons! <br/>- More or less fixed all of the “Sack” items. The “Small” and “Medium” --- “Loot” event was broken! <br/>- Fixed the “File” event for the “Expensive Nail File”<br/>- Fixed an elusive period. <br/>- Fixed player damage. I hit for 203 &gt;_&gt;; Non-critical LOL. Destroyed that fking zombie though! Fixed player critical and adjusted it again and again. <br/>- After some more “Backpack” debacle you can no longer “Open”, “Close” or “Put Things” inside of “Containers” Their only purpose is to increase your inventory Carry Capacity. We’ll see how that works. I added in a message reminding players of the two different “Container” types; wearable and inventory. <br/>- Removed the “Waterskin” from the Backpack parent and made it appear in the “Waterhole” instead.<br/>- Fixed an arithmetic error that was happening with the game’s major turn-script  <br/>- Made it so the player cannot move if they are carrying too much weight  <br/>- Fixed missing period in the “Gameover” scene. <br/>- Added some messages to the player description about how to manage your carried or wearable containers; like dropping them and removing them etc. <br/>- I think I actually fixed the “waterskin” dropping “dirty” and “fresh” water when “closed” by removing it from the backpack. So …hurrah! I’ve tested it a few times now. <br/>- Created a second window pane exclusive made to hold “Container” objects so they won’t clog your inventory. Still trying to get it to work! <br/>- Removed the “Take” verb from the “East Hallway Closet”, “Search” items: ie. towel, face cloths and blankets. <br/>- The player can now become immobilized! It’ll only happen during scripted events I think though! So no worries  Oh! It’ll also happen if you’re carrying too much. <br/>- The “Backpack” and “Belt Pouch” are no longer “wearable”. Just having them in your inventory will increase your “Carry Capacity”!<br/>- Removed the “Belt Pouch” and the “Backpack” giving a “Serious Personality Point”. <br/>- Adjusted the new “Carry Capacity” description in the player description to reflect the changes above about them being non-wearable and wearable.<br/>- Removed the “Second Pane” I was implementing simply because it made things a little too complicated and it wasn’t necessary. I will have to think of something else.<br/>- Added a new “Skill” – “Thief Skill”! Which you can increase throughout the course of the game. Everyone but Thieves and Black Smith Assistants start at “0”, Thieves start with “6” and BSA starts with “3”. The max is “10” and how it’ll work is if you approach a “locked door” or “locked chest” or something like that, if you have a high enough “Thief Skill” you can unlock it. Pretty nifty, eh? I haven’t come up with ways to increase that number yet, but I’m sure I’ll come up with something. BTW, picking locks even as a thief raises your corruption by the requirement of the Thief Skill indicated (meaning if it takes a “4” to unlock, it’ll raise your corruption by “4” if you succeed and half that if you fail), so…do so at your own discretion! The “Thief Skill” has been added to the player description as well. With that said, every puzzle and treasure chest WILL always have a key, a combination or a way to get inside. But just in case you don’t find it, the “ThiefSkill” will be a secondary option. Also, thieving won’t ALWAYS work. There will be a high chance though if you have a high enough “Thief Skill” in the first place (like 80%). With every success though you have a chance to increase your “Thief Skill” by + “1” <br/>- You can now force open the “Master Bedroom” lock if you have a Thief Skill of at least “6” or greater. You can now force open the “Study” lock if you have a Thief Skill of at least “6” or greater. If you have the key you will automatically discard it afterward, if you acquire it later, you’ll keep it and don’t use it, you’ll keep it until you enter the “Study”. I added a message letting you know that as well. You cannot force open the Secondary Bedroom or Rold’s Lab. Since those are story related ^_~<br/>- Created a non-droppable, “Storage” holder for all your “Containers” which can be “opened” and “closed” to save inventory space! All storage containers will automatically be moved into it once you take them. <br/>- Created a non-droppable, “Worn Clothing” storage for all “worn” clothing, which can be “opened” and “closed” to save inventory space. All worn clothing will automatically be moved into it once you wear them. Although, I’ll need to extensively test this to see if it’ll even work. Wish it luck! Okay, so it works! except for one minor detail, the player cannot remove clothing once it’s stored in there. I’m sure there’s a simple code to fix it though! ^_^;; for removing it from the “Worn Clothing” container once it’s removed, which again is a very simple code. Except for a small coding issue I’m working on which allows the player to double wear clothing when the container is closed. It should be resolved soon though. <br/>- Removed the “test female zombie” from the starting area! As well as the “pregnancy dildo”! Though as more pregnancy stuff goes into the game I’ll put it back for testing purposes. <br/>- Made it so the thief skill values cannot go over “10” or under “1”.<br/>- Added four new items: each with a unique description: “Locking Picking Guide #1”, “Locking Picking Guide #2”, “Locking Picking Guide #3” and “Locking Picking Guide #4”. Basically, “using” them will increase your “Thief Skill” as long as you aren’t already passed the parameters of each book. The first book will increase you no higher than “2”, The second book will increase you no higher than “4”, the third book will increase you no higher than “6” and the last book will increase you no higher than “8”. The remaining “9” and “10” must be accomplished through actual lock picking, but it’s possible (if you find the guides enough) to increase your score from 1 to 8 without ever gaining an ounce of corruption. <br/>- Added a new item: “Expensive Plate” which can be looted from the “Display Case” in the “Study”. It has a unique description and if you’re carrying the “Spellbook” it will increase your damage by +1 while you’re carrying it. Although, it does hum with magical energy and is a Picksnap heirloom…<br/>- Added a new item: “Urn” which can be looted from the “Display Case” in the “Study”. It has a unique description and if you’re carrying the “Spellbook” it will increase your damage +2 (as long as you’re carrying it). It does hum with a lot of magical energy though and is a Picksnap heirloom as well…<br/>- Added a new item: “Heirloom Ring” which can be looted from the “Display Case” in the “Study”. It has a unique description and if you’re carrying the “Spellbook” it’ll increase your damage +1. This is a wearable item that goes on your finger (obviously). You can only wear one ring at a time  This particular one increases your “Sexy Points” by +1. <br/>- Added a new item: “Pearl Necklace” which can be looted from the “Display Case” in the “Study”. It has a unique description and if you’re carrying the “Spellbook” it’ll increase your damage by +1. This is a wearable item that goes around your neck. You can only wear one necklace at a time as well. This item also increases your “Sympathy Points” by +1. <br/>- Added 4 more “Clothing Slots”: Finger, Bracelet, Necklace and Ankle. They aren’t in the player description as of right now however.<br/>- Added 12 “Tattoo Slots”: Neck, Left Shoulder, Right Shoulder, Right Bicep, Left Bicep, Left Forearm, Right Forearm, Lower Back, Hip, Buttcheeks, Left Calf and Right Calf.<br/>- Added what “Body Slot” the Clothing Items take up. It’s listed in their descriptions.<br/>- I removed “Clothing Size Parameters” for the time being and have added subsequent descriptions regarding sizes that are too large  Basically, the only time clothing parameters will apply is when you have transformed something about yourself that cannot fit into clothing of that standard, for example, hooves with boots and so on. As for the old parameters, when you reach the larger sizes, the descriptions will begin to repeat, letting you know that you’ve surpassed that item’s comfortable size. Hope you guys like the new system!<br/>- Added the player’s “neck” to the player’s description as well as the “Pearl Necklace”. <br/>- Added the player’s “finger” to the player’s description as well as the “Diamond Heirloom Ring”<br/>- Added “labels” to your thieving expertise in the player description. <br/>- Added some revamped description to the player “tail” descriptions, if they happen to have one and added “Horny” variables to it and gender as well (but only for females). <br/>- Added some “horny” variables to the player’s breast/moob descriptions in the player description. So it’ll change a little if you’re horny or not, also fixed some minor spacing errors and changed a few lines in the “Horny” description in the “Lust” section of the player description.  <br/>- Changed the requirement for “lustful” eyes in the player description from “6” down to “4”. <br/>- Added the “Fashionable” Speciality stats to ALL current wearable items; meaning you get double stats from anything you put on (including personality). Modified the “Fashionable” Speciality description as well in the “Character Creator”.<br/>- Added 12 “Piercing Slots”: Left Ear Lobe, Right Ear Lobe, Upper Ears, Nose, Tongue, Eyebrow (left or right), Lip, Secondary Mouth (like snake bites, angel bites etc), Navel, Nipples, Genitals, and Back. ((How these will work is let’s use the “nose” for an example; if you get your nose “Pierced” you can wear any “nose gear” but only “1” of that type. Like a ring, or a septum item, or a nose stud, or a third eye --- etc.)) **I changed it to 11 “Piercing Slots” by combining “left earlobe” and “right earlobe” into just “earlobe” referring to both. But there will still be items that cover just one side if you’re interested in that!<br/>- Added “Resist” to the player’s arsenal. “Resist” as you have probably guessed helps you resist things like instant transformations. For example, if you open a box and get blasted with some type of transformation spell, if you happen to have some “Resist” your character will be able to fight the transformation from happening and therefore remain unchanged. If you have no “Resist” left, well, all transformations are fair game. You have “3” Resists total before you run out of them. What happens after that? Simple! Just resting/sleeping in the game will completely recharge them. Also, “Cursed” clothing is NOT affected by “Resist”. If you have some “Cursed” outfit on, you’re on your own! “Decursers” are the only way to stop those particular transformations  Hope you guys like that!<br/>- Added “Resist” to the player description just below your “Carry Capacity”. <br/>- I went back through and completely rewrote all of the player descriptions AND added piercing descriptions within all of as well so that it flowed as smoothly as possible. That literally took an entire day. Now to test it for bugs! So there were several bugs, all of which have been addressed and fixed. I also fixed a few spelling errors, punctuation mistakes and all that fun stuff! Seems very good now and reads smoothly with or without piercings. Also, the “centaur” transformations are less “horsy” now. Meaning you’ll retail a humanoid face, you’ll just have like horse ears and a horse body and so on. <br/>- Fixed a “fashionable” speciality error that had to do with doubling the stats. I forgot the quotes  <br/>- Confirmed that the “Lab Key” is indeed working properly. <br/>- Took another day messing around with the new “Carry System” (Pix helped me with the problem). The system was counting objects/items with a volume of “0” as weight. As a result, even carrying 3 objects with 0 volume was keeping the playing from moving. Now there’s one other issue to solve…<br/>- Simplified some of the coding for all changeable attributes; now you can be less than or greater than their “current” maximum amounts like: hairlength, height, weight etc. I did that so I could code items and events much faster without having to worry about accounting for things being too long or growing and shrinking beyond the current parameters.<br/>- Fixed a small “Carry” problem  Everything should be working 100%. Except that double wear issue. <br/>- Added a new message to the “Waterskin” about how to fill it and open it.  A lot of people were having issues with that apparently.",

I have yet to figure out how to get out of the \"tutorial\" home, since doing the request for the goblin guy just ends the game. Going outside and fighting the zombies only leads to diving off a cliff as well. What am I supposed to do?_\r\n\r\nHello! I'm in the middle of remastering a lot of the content for the Withered Snag (Goblin House). What happened was when I first started writing the game I only had a female protagonist. By the time I got close to finishing Rold and the Goblin House, I had gotten so many requests for a male lead that I decided to go back and remaster the old content (make the writing better while also adding in a male protagonist and the mood dynamic as well) because I wanted to accommodate those players and raise the replayability. That's why sometimes it seems like there isn't any \"new\" content. It's not that there isn't, I'm just rewriting and adding in variables that the game simply didn't have before so that each time you play it, it'll be a little different and customized for the type of character you want to play.\r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of hidden things that you won't necessarily discover on your first play-through. For example, you don't have to dive off the cliff-side---there's an alternate path that takes strength and agility variables into account and changes what happens in that scene. There are several examples of that throughout the game, for example again, you can actually make Hannah angry enough now to kick you out of the house, which changes the way the scenes outside are presented. \r\n\r\nI've recently (in the past two months or so now) split my time between adding new content and remastering old content and increasing the variables that can happen in each so that each player will experience something a little differently and so their choices matter. People always want a free-form game and to be able to manipulate it any way that they want---well, I'm actually trying my best to consider all those possible options, unfortunately, that kind of quality and consideration takes a lot of time as does good writing.

      "HTML": "<p><em>I see this game get plenty of updates on TFgames, but whenever I play I never find any new content. I have yet to figure out how to get out of the \"tutorial\" home, since doing the request for the goblin guy just ends the game. Going outside and fighting the zombies only leads to diving off a cliff as well. What am I supposed to do?</em></p>\n<p>Hello! I'm in the middle of remastering a lot of the content for the Withered Snag (Goblin House). What happened was when I first started writing the game I only had a female protagonist. By the time I got close to finishing Rold and the Goblin House, I had gotten so many requests for a male lead that I decided to go back and remaster the old content (make the writing better while also adding in a male protagonist and the mood dynamic as well) because I wanted to accommodate those players and raise the replayability. That's why sometimes it seems like there isn't any \"new\" content. It's not that there isn't, I'm just rewriting and adding in variables that the game simply didn't have before so that each time you play it, it'll be a little different and customized for the type of character you want to play.</p>\n<p>There are also a lot of hidden things that you won't necessarily discover on your first play-through. For example, you don't have to dive off the cliff-side---there's an alternate path that takes strength and agility variables into account and changes what happens in that scene. There are several examples of that throughout the game, for example again, you can actually make Hannah angry enough now to kick you out of the house, which changes the way the scenes outside are presented.</p>\n<p>I've recently (in the past two months or so now) split my time between adding new content and remastering old content and increasing the variables that can happen in each so that each player will experience something a little differently and so their choices matter. People always want a free-form game and to be able to manipulate it any way that they want---well, I'm actually trying my best to consider all those possible options, unfortunately, that kind of quality and consideration takes a lot of time as does good writing. I don't want to half ass something and throw it out to the players and call it good. I want them to be genuinely blown away by what they experience and to become immersed in the world. I also want them to be able to come back again and again and find something a little different or new each time ^_^</p>\n<p>In the next update, I should have a couple of more rooms completed and hopefully some more systems as well. All I can say is I'm doing my absolute best to get out new content and make the rest playable and meaningful too. I hope that answered your question or inquiries. If not, let me know!
