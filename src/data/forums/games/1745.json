      "EditableText": "My notepad.asl file is 468 kb right now.  I have a-little more than 100 rooms.  That's about a half to a third of the rooms that are going to be in my game.  Including a small tutorial game that first-time text-adventurers can play to practice commands and such before playing the main game, there are 5 major levels planned.  Within those major levels are sub-levels, bringing the total to 8 levels.  Each level is a new type of place/situation so the game is like 5 games in one, but has a consistent theme.  There will be a soundtrack with a channel selector to choose diffrent types of background music.  There are graphics.  I'm even considering narrating every single line (I'll have to test that though... this feature will probably be one of the last additions).   I'm glad you told me about the Quest-crash thing, since I'll know what's going on now if that occurs to me. I'm stuck in the tutorial part of the game on some odd errors occurring.  I'm waiting for Alex to help me on that.  Although about 80% of the rooms I have set right now are basically finished.  Mine is not a multi-player game.",
