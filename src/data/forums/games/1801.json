Im so proud of myself. dther99, please just look outside your window, and think about the possibilities just waiting around the corner for you. This is not a world you belong in. This world of game creating is not the place for one such as you. Maybe in a few years, yes, when your grammer and IQ have gone up a bit, maybe even your maturity. But for now, please just leave. You don't belong in this world as much as quest belongs in yours. <br/>Good Day, I hope you take my advice and leave before you are ground into the dirt by ones much crueler than me.<br/><br/>~AT</blockquote><br/><br/>Sorry, I could have wrote out a long descriptive book on this particular subject but I couldn't be bothered, so maybe this spam of quotes will help... Somehow. WHo knows, maybe these crappy authors will take the hint?<br/><br/>Thana",
