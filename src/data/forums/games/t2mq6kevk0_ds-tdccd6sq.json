If you never heard of this gamebook, this is a game that focus on riding dogs via this quest game. It's also going to have links to other gamebooks hosted on my own website.\r\nAlthough; this game is going to be free to play, but I've added a donation page for people to donate to my game to support development of this game what I am developing.\r\nWhy I am making this game because, I once ridden on a back of a dog since childhood, and my imagination still has this concept, and I decided to turn it into a game. I also have a dream of riding a large poodle on November, 2004. However; my dream like this is really coming back.\r\nYou can also make your own quest game that focused on riding dogs.\r\nWhat's Dog Ride Quest In General?\r\nDog Ride Quest is a text-adventure game that takes you to a world that gives you an ability to ride a dog. You are deployed into a car-free city, and you start off at your house. One of these dog types enables you to get a longer quest, but you need to choose a dog to ride carefully.\r\nHere are 4 dog types to choose from via initial gameplay:\r\nPoodle\r\nPit Bull\r\nLabrador\r\nBulldog\r\nEach dog takes you to a different place, enabling you to go on an adventure.\r\nThis game is also licensed under a Creative Commons Share-Alike 4.0 License, so you can reuse it, and make your own game that is based-on this game. You are free to play this game, please provide me feedback, if you found any bugs. If you found them, I'll fix them as soon as possible.\r\nIs this game free?\r\nThis game is free to play online, there are no paywalls, but a donation prompt... however; a donation before playing this game is optional.\r\nIs this game designed for little kids only?\r\nNo, this game is for everybody! Diversity is key for my audience.\r\nDoes it contain any fetish?\r\nNo, there's no fetishism found. I believe fetishism is considered taboo.\r\nWhy there are choices to pick instead of typing commands?\r\nThis is easier for players to make a choice in this game.\r\nIs it a first-person format?\r\nYes, this is a first-person format.\r\nDoes it have DRM?\r\nThere's no DRM enabled.\r\nBe aware; this game may be updated as external gamebooks hosted elsewhere. Here's a link to this game that is being worked on: https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/-cbvmmrefuy-fvytbrs6dq/dog-ride-quest",
