In it you play a unique character, one of four that you get to choose to start as, and you are faced with choices that will shape the world, ultimately up to the final big battle. It's going to be quite extensive, and quite long.\n\nMy question is this, are many people here familiar with that TV series? If so, would this game interest anyone? It's going to be some time before it's ready for any beta testing, as I have only scratched the surface, but if anyone is interested in beta testing leave a comment and i'll jot your name down to be one of the testers when it's all finished.",
