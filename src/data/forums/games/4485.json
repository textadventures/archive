Do you like sounds when playing a texting or do you prefer to keep it quite? Also how much is too much when it comes to sounds? For instance a stream running while in certain area or birds chirping in a forested area, chopping of a tree then fallen down. Just trying to get a better grip on what users prefer.\nThanks\nMike",
