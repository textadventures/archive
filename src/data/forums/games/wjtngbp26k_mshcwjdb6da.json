It has a very stripped down interface, but QuestJS does support the side pane that earlier versions of Quest have. My next game will showcase that - whatever it might be. QuestJS runs in the client so you will see much faster responses than with Quest 5 and it will not time-out if you just leave the game for a couple of hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
