The only thing I disliked in that game was, The days were to short, not giving the character enough time to do half of what was needed to do. Even though there was a lot more to do.\n\nExample:\n\nThere was harvesting.\nFeeding animals.\nBreeding animals.\nMining.\nAnd a few other things.\n\nYou had to use strategy just to either harvest/plant/water and feeding animals but had to leave out the rest due to lack of time in the game. If you had a lot of vegetables, You would only be watering or planting them and harvesting them all day, even with the help of the sprites you didn't get much done.\n\nThat was the only thing that got me to decide not to play that game again. If your game has a better times for each day. I will certainly enjoy trying out your game.\n\nGood luck <!-- s:) --><img src=\"{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><!-- s:) -->",
