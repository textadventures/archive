If anyone would like to translate it into English (or any other language, for that matter), be welcome to get in touch with me. Not only for the glory of appearing in the final game's credits, but for the joy of bringing a new story to as many people as possible. Bear in mind that I'm broke and payment would be... well, impossible.\r\nAny opinions, feedback or critique is also welcome, of course. I'm still fairly new to Quest and I still have quite a lot of room for improvement.\r\nAnd, without further ado, here's the link to the demo. Thanks for your time, for playing (if you do play), and for any help that may come my way:\r\nhttp://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/n4dh4u8ehucykz-mfslrsa/omega",
