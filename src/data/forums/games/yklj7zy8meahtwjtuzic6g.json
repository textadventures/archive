Just don't give it a second one or two star grade, especially if you don't approve of narrative based discovery style games with little puzzles and looking for things. If it isn't a great game, just pm me and tell me what isn't great. I thought it was fantastic, myself. (Not a phone game - there's sound).  Chapter 1 and 3 are separate games, but they are all also stand alone gameplay.\r\n\r\nhttps://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/0r4mfmw5hueigxmaaqd3iw/an-antikythera-lunar-new-year",
