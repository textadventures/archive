And I recently read &quot;Count Monte-Cristo&quot; And the scene, in which the shipowner Morrel starts to commit suicide made me think about AAA titles, that are released, and we all know, that in none of them real drama or horror can be found. So I returned to the start of video games, and thought to myself, maybe should I make a text adventure. And so now here I am.\n\n------------------------------\nYou are an Italian shipowner by the name of Firnino Ettore 53 years old, who has built a lasting empire of trading. You own 5 of the most profitable ships on the ocean, which sail to Spain, England, France and Africa. Your son, Faria Ettore, is 22 years old has gone to France. Your daughter is 16 years old and lives with you. \n------------- \n\nThe game is under the genre horror, because that's what it is essentially. I think, that the less said, the better. If you are interested, you should try playing it. The game is constantly trying to make you do things, that you do not want to do, but you have no other choices., when you are cornered in the situation. \n\nAnd the drama, and mourning, the tension, and choices... That for me is real horror.\n\nLINK HERE: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/wccntokhtuui3b_cnku_nq/bankruptcy\">http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/ ... bankruptcy</a><!-- m -->\n\nI am looking for proof readers, test players, and feedback.

With that, this is an instance where I found myself intrigued to keep reading and see where the story goes.\n\nMy only complaint are in those moments where you reserved about a page for an entire sentence with one page link.  I find those as a pet peeve of mine as it is nothing but redundant.\n\nKeep up the good work!",
