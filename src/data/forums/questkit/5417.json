I realise only the barebones are here now, but as I am planning a long term project, the barebones are fine till I learn the ropes, because its been awhile since I was a coder.\n\nDo you plan to add backwards support for previous versions as you go along? That is will the content I make now be usable through the alpha, even if I have to copy paste and edit a bit, that's fine to tweak/alter it.  Not seeking anything 100% perfect I obviously expect to alter things, I am just wondering on your own stance or view on development and existing games.\n\n2, Also what is your stance on:\n*People making commercial projects with the kit.\n*Hobby donation projects.\n\nThanks for any help.",
