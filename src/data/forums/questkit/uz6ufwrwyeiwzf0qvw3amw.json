      "EditableText": "The problem is that the vertical bar takes precedence; first Quest breaks the string where there are vertical bars, and then it does the text processor stuff. Using `<br/>` is a solution, but not a great one - I think you will find the line spacing is odd, as everywhere else Quest uses `<p>`. You may be able to use CSS to correct that. You could also try `</p><p>`; not sure how that will work out...\r\n\r\nThat said, \"msgDrop\" should only be used if the command is successful, which would only be if the item is held (hmm, NPCs dropping stuff may be different), so would you be better doing:\r\n```\r\nmsgDrop:\"{class:classOne:Text to print.}|{class:classOne:New Line Text}\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr perhaps using an \"afterDrop\" function, depending on what that second line is?",
