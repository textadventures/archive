I'm working on a game right now and releasing the it when it's done is currently a bit of an issue for me. If people download Quest to play the game, not only is that an extra step for them which will be an issue for some people, but they would then have the ability to edit and mess around with the game, which is undesirable. And as for hosting the game on this site, that's not really desirable either as there are so many games hosted currently it's very difficult to get noticed, and I would actually prefer to host the game on my own website if I was going to go that route anyway, but that's not currently a viable solution.\r\n\r\nFrom the sounds of it, Quest 6 would solve a lot of these issues, but I also don't want to wait until that is released to start working on my game, and my knowledge of JavaScript isn't strong enough to use Quest 6 in it's current state.",
