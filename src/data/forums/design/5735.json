For example, if you want a game with replay value, than obviously you want them to choose a different path (thus a different game) each time. If your game features unique character builds, then if you got separate paths, you're going to need them to be equal for each of the different character builds a person may use: you don't want a person playing an archer taking the left path, which only has stuff for a barbarian character. There's just a ton of such variables, so it's a bit moot to discuss such a topic. There's just too many factors involved.\n\nThat said, in general, and for me personally, I like divergent~separate~unique paths, as it feels like it's many games in one, but I also in regards to each individual paths, I prefer more forced (linear) paths than openness of play (HK looks at Morrowind), too (though if done well they give the illusion of more freedom~openness).\n\n----------------\n\nalso, are you refering to physical paths in the game (maze, rooms traversed) vs story~plot paths ???
