      "EditableText": "I would like to know if there is a way in Quest to make the speech between characters scroll out slowly, like it does in RPGs usually.  You do not see one huge block of text pop up, but the words one at a time in it's &quot;bubble&quot; or &quot;box&quot;, sometimes slowly and sometimes in quick succession.  Is there a way to mimic that effect? (The bubble or box is less important then the speed itself.) Also is there a way to take it a step further and also be able to press a button to make the rest of the text come out all at once, since some people like to speed up conversations more than others or depending how I set up my conversations, my NPCs may be repeating themselves quite often.  If you still have no idea what I mean, think of reading over the shoulder of someone typing on a computer or even better a type writer.  It is not agonizingly slow, but not bam in your face the entire text either.  I want it to be smooth and maybe ways to adjust the speed if possible to my liking or other's suggestions.  Thanks.",
