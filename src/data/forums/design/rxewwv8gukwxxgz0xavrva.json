I'm not sure if this is the best place to put this, but if anyone would like some help with voicing characters for an upcoming game, I would like to offer my services. Whether just one or multiple, I have my own editing software and decent equipment. I look forward to possibly working with you all. I'm not asking for payment or anything, just recognition in the credits and if possible something to add to my portfolio. Thank you for reading.",
