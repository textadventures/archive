I've never done this before but always had a _need_ to tell a story but my outlets never really worked out. So I'm giving this a shot because I love storytelling and video games, but I have no design ability. \r\n\r\nThe premise of my game is about a hunter and without giving away everything, there's a lot of mystery surrounding his hunting cabin, and why he wakes up there with an aching head and a foggy brain (he doesn't drink either!). But I'm having a hard time finding free stock images of believable hunting cabin interiors. I can come up with my own audio (if what I'm looking for can't be found). Visual wise I'm looking for dark, rustic looking interiors (nothing fancy or mansion-like, so no \"spa\" cabins with hot tubs and immaculate windows and doors, this is pretty much a shack in the woods, with a small living space/kitchen with a tiny bathroom and bedroom which may or may not be seen.) Does anyone know where I can find free images like this? I say free because well honestly, I'm at the end of my rope in a part time job. I don't have a lot of money to work with. I was actually thinking of going into my Sims games and making the cabin interior, taking some screenshots and making some edits to them in another program if it comes to that. \r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated. \r\nThank you.
