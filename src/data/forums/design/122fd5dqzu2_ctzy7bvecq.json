There are also actions that take multiple turns (like you can tell them \"go to [name of room]\" and they'll find their way there, so you can use the commands in between to have the other robots do something) and there are some commands that might need more than one robot in the same place to do them.\r\n\r\nI don't think I've seen any other games in the same vein.

Some custom attributes for what everything looks like in the various ways of detecting them, and of course each robot could have a different way of saying \"I can't go that way\" or \"I can't see that here\".\r\n\r\nHaving the robots move around the rooms would be easy enough. Possibly you also move around some disconnected rooms where each one is actually which robot you are controlling, with custom commands in each room. (Or you could change the player object to be the robot, I think, but not sure which way would be best)\r\n\r\nI think theoretically you should also be able to display a map of the facility with robot locations within the game? I think that would be the way to go these days rather than rely on feelies. (Or even if it's just a static map you can look at, the robots after all report their locations to you)\r\n\r\nPersonally my one issue might be that I wouldn't want invalid commands (such as from a typo) to increase the turn counter, as IIRC you only had a limited time before the guys that think everything going wrong is your fault come down and end you.\r\n",
