When it's done this way, it is fun.  I'll even see how many ways I can die, just to make sure I don't miss any funny text!\r\n\r\n...but, if you occasionally kill me without giving me a chance to undo that turn, I will lose interest.  Especially if it's a good-sized game.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nA Constant Adventurer",

I give the player 3 options (one of which is hidden and reduces their damage (they need to be clever or have high intelligence to find it)), the other two are take your chances and jump off and avoid being eaten alive, or stay and try to fight off the entire horde.

So 80% chance they get a warning that consuming the potions at maximum height or minimum height could possibly have dire consequences.
