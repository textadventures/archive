I'm prepping a class on interactive fiction, and starting by lining up examples of various kinds (Lost Pig as an example of z-machine based, some InkleWriter works to demonstrate choice-based, etc.)\r\n\r\nI planned to use Escape from Byron Bay as an example of a Quest game, but one image in the game is broken, and it's an image that has 1 of the 3 codes required to win the game!\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what the code is that is on the broken image, OR is there an alternate web location where Byron Bay can be played (and works)? OR, is there a similar Quest example that could be a good substitute? Reasons for using Byron Bay include the length and the implementation of the timer, which would provide a little friendly competition among my students :-)\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated, and thanks!\r\n\r\n-Doug\r\n",
