I'm now wondering if this was a good idea as I don't really know where to go or how best to lead the player along the storyline. The game does have a goal, and I'm trying to allow enough freedom for the player to get there in his/her own way.\n\nPacing in another factor that's difficult to convey. I've been working on this game for weeks now, making it feel, to me, like some epic blockbuster. In truth, a player would be able to get through all the locations and activities in about five minutes flat.\n\nSo, how do you go about building your worlds?",

I guess that might not matter so much in IF but you do need some kind of plan. I usually think of the ending first.",
