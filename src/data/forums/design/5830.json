Also, a lot of game making or coding is quite boring and monatonous~repetitive, at least for what I'm able to do with coding, anyways. It's really a struggle when you don't know how to code well. A finished~playable game really takes you to already know the coding, and just requiring you to figure out your game's design, which once you do that, then it's easy to code all that stuff in, as you're good at coding.

It might not be the great leaps you'd like, but it is some sort of progress. It's better than sitting down, opening Quest, maybe playing the current game a bit and then wandering off and coming back later when it's time for bed and you need to shut down the computer and you realize you did *absolutely nothing at all*. \n\nBut sometimes you even need to do that.\n\nI'd say if you don't even have the creative whatevers to add another room, then you're either in a lull mentally or the game has run out of steam to some extent. (You can tell the difference by whether you have interest in other things or not.)\n\nI have had similar problems with my own games. To that extent, I have one game finished and a number by the wayside (so perhaps I'm not the best person to ask). What I have found is that it often helps to take a step back or just time off. That has happened to me with a project that I was really keen on - then I got discouraged over some things and wandered off to other things, like online courses, which I have now also lost some momentum for. \n\nAnd it's all ok, in my opinion. I then went back to the game I hadn't touched in months, played the minimal part I had completed (the title and bits of the first area), and I don't know if it's absence making the heart grow fonder or what, but I suddenly wanted to get back to it. So I've been thinking again about it (not coded yet, as I don't know the direction I want to go), but the enthusiasm came back.\n\nThat might not work for everyone. If you walk away from the game for a while, you might never get back to it. That's a risk, but I think if you've done anything in there that works for you, and if the idea still appeals on some level, it will call you back. And if it doesn't, then even if you pushed and slogged your way through it, it will probably end up crap since your heart isn't in it. Find something that does work for you.\n\nSo I'd say - give it a break, go off and do something else, take some time to let it clear a bit (where &quot;a bit&quot; could be days or even weeks), then come back and see where you are with it. If it's real, the enthusiasm will come back when the time is right.\n\nNow, it feels different when you get to that last 1%, but that can be the hardest part sometimes. Hopefully by that point, you've got enough going on in the game that you really want people to play it, and that can help to carry you through to the end.\n\nBut again, most importantly: any progress is progress. Even if it's just one thing you did today, it's more than you had when the day began. Don't knock that.",

So who did this apocalypse happen to? What's an apocalypse that happens to nobody? Create that world, create that nation, create that town, create those people.

I believe that once a world has history, it almost begins to build itself once you let your imagination run with it. After reading your post regarding the game set in the post-epidemic wasteland, and given that my current project is also set after an apocalyptic event, I did tailor my post to deal quite specifically with a post-apocalyptic theme. As I said however, I believe that such a setting is where it is both easiest to forget, and most devastating when one does forget, that an apocalypse did not create your world, rather, it happened to it. \n\nIn my current project, I expect to be dealing with a similar problem to yourself in parts, due to the nature of my setting. To combat this, I'm focusing not so much on making the physical structures themselves as unique as possible, only as necessary, but on the events that took place within them. One memorable location is worth countless bland, forgettable ones. When I say as unique as necessary, there are always boundaries. Although diversity between your locations is fantastic, it has to remain believable... Or they at least must share a somewhat defined theme, it's almost a catch-22, but there is a goldilocks zone. I can't say much more to be honest, the finer details are up to you of course, it's your world. What I am saying though is don't get hung up on having to make everything spectacularly diverse. If each location has it's own little quirks, secrets and stories, people will remember those, not the fact that a few buildings were a little similar in physical appearance and what-not. There's no escaping the latter for most of us.",
