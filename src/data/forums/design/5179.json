Sorry.\n\nBut, I have noticed that if I get stuck on a problem getting a script to work, I take a break and add rooms, objects, and their descriptions.  It's a nice surprise once I get to the point when I need those things, they're already done.  I've found that really speeds things up.  For example, about 90% of all my items and rooms in game two are completely ready for use.  Now I just need to grind through the code.\n\nI've considered making a game ONLY using scripts I'm comfortable using.  If I did that, I'm not sure it's be a great game but a could churn out a decent one in a couple days.\n\nNow that I re-read all that junk, I realize how unhelpful I've really been!!  Glad I could help!  Lol\n\nGood luck!",
