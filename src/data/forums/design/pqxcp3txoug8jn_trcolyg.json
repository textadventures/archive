The further out you are, the less damage you will take.\r\n\r\nAnd then alien shields. If you've managed to (in future) find alien tech, maybe you can have their shields, and I figure if anyone can ward off radiation, it's gotta be high-tech, long-deal aliens.\r\n\r\nAnd your own ship armor. It's not in the game yet but I've put in the coding segments for adding armor to your ship. That would block some of the damage.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is if you are currently passing a planet or gas giant. If you want to spend a fuel point, you can move your ship into the shadow of the planet.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, you can pump up to five units of water/oxygen to the flare-ward tanks and shield your crew. Of course, it will have to be dumped after you contaminate it.\r\n\r\nOr you just take your rads like a good little spaceman.\r\n\r\nBut it's amazing what your mind does while you sleep...",
