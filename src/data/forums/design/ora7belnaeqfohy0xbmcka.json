Problem is, I can barely wrap my head around it, and I don't know if it can do what I need, or if I'll have to scrap using it. Mainly, I'm writing an RPG Text Adventure, with a rather detailed Character Creation system that includes, among other things, 3 Social Skills that I need to reference for conversations: Charm, Intimidate, and Deceive.\r\n\r\nThe Library seemed like it would work at first glance, since it DOES have a Script option, but I realized rather quickly it happens AFTER the text. I'm also not sure if I can use that to make restrictions on what can be done based on your skills (or lack there-of). There's also suppose to be Race- and Class-based restrictions and benefits. And Alignment-based benefits might be added if my Alignment system turns out okay when I get around to working on it (it's probably the next thing after I finally build the starting area and finish character customization).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if this is possible? And if it is, how I'd go about doing it?",
