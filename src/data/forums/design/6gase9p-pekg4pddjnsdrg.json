      "EditableText": "Hey, everyone. RPGs are a popular genre around here, but making up your own rules for them is tricky. I see people asking for help with that all the time. One solution is adapting generic rule systems, but those are usually designed for tabletop games, which means they assume a human GM will be present. As that's not the case in videogames, such conversions tend to draw criticism. And rules made for specific games, such as certain famous MMOs, they're probably not so great for simpler, single-player games either.\r\n\r\nI recently finished writing down such a rule system (after it sat on my HDD at 90% completion since spring). It's called [Battles&Balances](https://notimetoplay.itch.io/battles-and-balances), and everyone is free to use it. Being made for roguelikes originally, I'm not sure how well it would work in a Quest game, but a starting point is better than nothing. At least we're talking rules that were tested and refined in finished games. And you'll see it's pretty flexible, with all kinds of variant and optional rules already included, along with guidelines for making your own.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Enjoy! Feedback is welcome.",

      "EditableText": "Hello there, and sorry for the time to reply to this one. I hope the topic dint got old, because i would like adding my two cents to the community.\r\n\r\nI never published anything, but i have been trying to design games for Quest since around 2014, accumulating a lot of plot ideas but lacking time and focus to complete at least one of them. However, during the planning and design, i faced the need of having a game system to support my games, so i decided using my 30 years of Roleplaying games background as a source for a good system design.\r\n\r\nAll i wanted to avoid was monolithic and unflexible systems, like those used on most 'Gaming' RPGs. Explaining a little better, i am basing my observation on the GNS (sometimes referred to as GSN) theory, which basically divides RPGs in three main tribes: Gaming, Narrativism and Simulation.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, even if not that huge and complex, Battles&Balances is more inclined to the old style 'gaming' RPGs. It is much more about having things balanced and previously structured, having diferente characters perfetly balanced on their skills and powers.\r\n\r\nHonestly, i do not think it is the right direction. I found myself much more inclined to narrative RPGs systems and one i strongly recommend you taking a look, is FATE RPG. I am using FATE myself as a base for my own Interactive Stories and i already tested it on roleplaying games, both face to face as online text based roleplaying sessions too. \r\n\r\nLong ago i wandered about writing the rules and ideas for my \"CYOA version\" for FATE. At the time i tought it would be irrelevant and i would have nowhere to publish it. Now i see how it would be useful.\r\n\r\nIn short, FATE is open sourced, so anyone may use it and modify it. There is no problem if you want using its rules. Second, the main or core rules varies on sizes depending of what is called \"distribution\", but it is Always around 20 pages only. The good stuff about using FATE on text adventures and CYOA is that, as a narrative system, it takes in account what the elements means to the given situation, intead of having pre-fixed rules for each possible situation. The game is basically divided into two main áreas: skills and Aspects. Skills are pretty much like what we know as skills. but the weight and range of the skills may be modifyed for the game in question. Once i saw a game having a long list of detailed skills based on Gurps skill list. Once i played a game of Star Trek where i used just a short list of skills: Command, Navigation, Science, Medical, Engineering and Tactics. So, one skill for each Star Trek branch. Nowdays, on CYOA, i have been using just three skills - Mental, Physical and Social - which Works as a wondeful umbrela for every situation.\r\n\r\nAs for Aspects, here is where the magic happens. Aspects are things you may tell about the character. It would be a concept, like Brash Pilot or Seductress, it would be na adjective, like Tall, Strong or Smart, and it would also be social things, lik rich, poor or anything else you want. Aspects are all the same. The mains thing with the Aspects is that you spend Fate Points to engage your Aspects, and gets Fate Points when they create problems for the player. I found it perfect for a text adventure. You do not need to create a long list of things and then balance them and then write their rules. Just list what you plan would have relevance during your game, in order to keep some balance to it and then presente the right options when the character has the right Aspect.\r\n\r\nFate is very short, simple and elegante. And the main thing is it is perfect for narrating a story. It has other powers hidden in its sleeves, as the concept of Aspects may be put everywhere you want, from tools to places and situations. So, \"Cut things\" from na axe, \"Rain and Clouds\" from a scene and \"On fire\" from a situation are all Aspects to be exploited by the player as the game follows.\r\n\r\nIf people here have more interest about it, i may write a little bit about how i adapted FATE rules for CYOA and how i plan using it on games using Quest.\r\n\r\nSorry if the text got a little messy. I was writing pretty fast, English is not my first language and i had not time to review the post. Thanks everyone.\r\n",

It means that Brazil, during 1989, I had no Internet  ( as it was not implemented yet for public use), inflation was high, paying for things in dollars was abusive due the exchange and importing things was slow, expensive and complicated. \r\n\r\nI  started playing D&D with a friend.  I  got crazy about the idea of roleplaying, but had no access to a proper system myself.

I increased Star Trek later using Fate and then set myself playing only Gurps and Fate most of the time.

This is because I love RPG. While for most people it is ok calling a game RPG because it has stats and items, I think the real RPG only happens when there is a character, a persona to be roleplayed, a story and a drama to be lived.

I am not a fan of mechanics, but of human conflicts. ",
