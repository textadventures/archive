In the next few days we will adjust this functionality until it is in its final state.\r\n\r\nIn principle it is not configurable by the user and as I say we will adjust in the coming days, when we have enough data we will see if we keep them in their original place or they happen to be in the upper part as they are now. Do not you think it's right to show up in that place?",
