I've never quite understood this.  I had some issues when publishing X1 I recall.  I think I have 3 or 4 different updated/changed versions of it on my home PC.  I actually suggested that someone republish their game as private, save their current .aslx file as something different using the save as..., and publish that new file to Quest after generating a new game ID.\r\n\r\nIs there any way for a user to totally remove their own games from the site?  I cannot think of a reason why they couldn't.  I know Alex had deleted some games for some legit reasons (either by request from the author or due to unlawful/disgusting content).  \r\n\r\nI would suggest adding a way for authors to delete their own games.  Or, if there is some reason not to give them that privilege, have some contact or request form for games to be removed by someone with the power to do so.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  Upon checking my \"published to site\" games, I have 3 online version games and 9 or 10 offline version games.  I have one delete option under one of my online games but not the others and apparently no way of deleting my offline games.  Weird.  ",
