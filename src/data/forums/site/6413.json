This is confusing, as it's not obvious that the accounts are separate, and each site has a completely different look and feel.\n\nNow, finally, I am going to integrate the forums with the main site.\n\n[attachment=0:z5cu47ep]<!-- ia0 -->Screen Shot 2016-06-09 at 23.07.11.png<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:z5cu47ep]\n\nI have almost finished the initial work on this and I expect to launch the new forums some time in the next few weeks. All the current posts from the old forums will be migrated over, and old links will redirect to the right place.\n\nYour login to the main site is all you'll need to participate in the new forums, so your username and avatar for new posts will come from your profile there. Your old posts from the old forums will be unaffected, so they'll continue to appear with your old forum username and avatar. Just be aware that if you had different names on the old forum and main site, in future it'll be your name on the main site that will appear on your new posts.\n\nModerators will also change - if you're a moderator on the main site, you'll automatically be a moderator on the forums too.\n\nIn terms of features, I've created the new forums from scratch with a fairly minimal feature set to keep things simple and clean:\n\n- format posts using Markdown and/or HTML\n- edit and delete your posts\n- highlighting of new posts since your last visit\n- link to individual posts within a thread\n- Atom feeds for new posts to each forum, and a feed for new posts to all forums\n- responsive layout so the forums work nicely on mobile devices\n\nI've not implemented attachments yet. I expect I will add this fairly soon, but in the meantime you could use a service like [url=http&#58;//imgur&#46;com/:z5cu47ep]imgur[/url:z5cu47ep] for attaching screenshots to posts.\n\nI hope you'll enjoy using the new forums, and hopefully it will mean more people participating here.
