If any of them ever manage to write a complete game, we'll need a place to shove it off for quarantine to try and prevent the plague that always follows. Since we don't have a children's category either, I'd be unsure where to put it otherwise. And I imagine there's lots of other fanfic throughout the site that's gotten lost in fantasy or sci-fi or wherever.",
