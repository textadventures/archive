All bots have no access to real-time browsing, meaning I tell them to check on this forum right now and they says \"unable\"\r\n2. You need Web Scraping or Data Aggregation to dig all info from a website manually and post into the bot to find anomalies\r\n3. You need parameters to tell the bot what to find and what links counts as advertisements which is logically hard\r\n\r\nSo, I hand click checked all the threads in the 1st page of each forum category of the 1st post and found only two sus\r\nBut I learned that\r\n1. The advertisers doesn't have to be the original poster, therefore it is required to scan through all posts instead of the 1st post, which is too much workload, Im not going to do that =D\r\n2. Some advertisers have the ability to make ad games +  post on forum, but the games were already removed, so the mods here already knows about it\r\n3. Some sus wants you to sign up on external websites, which can be dangerous as it means you potentially give your email to the email scam and spam agents, but I could be wrong on this\r\n\r\n",
