Infact, twice the same review by different users. At the **same** time.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, this looks like bot activity. Atleast in the case of the user Mercedez (http://textadventures.co.uk/user/view/nupmktue2kcimnbb-pqdcw/mercedez) who is mimicking the posts of user Billie (http://textadventures.co.uk/user/view/qvuyylaeieimhnsq_4_bba/billie) word for word.\r\n***\r\nAnd there is a second thing, the reviews of this game: http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/cpp_gxhei0swvbtsfdf6ca/adventurer\r\n\r\nAgain, i haven't played it, but just look at the reviews. First, there is obviously some formatting failure here with the sesquipedalian inputs. But that isn't what cought my attention:\r\n\r\nIts this thing  whole thing about \"Hahaha GET TROLLED\", both in the review by China_FBI and then a user with similar name showing up right after... and China_FBI even admits to be an alt account (are alts allowed on this site?).\r\n***\r\nI really don't know what is going on here, and don't want to be an obnoxious vigilante roaming the site... but if i see something odd, making a forum post is the only way, since theres no way to flag something for moderators to investigate.",
