So, you'll be able to choose a category tag, an age rating tag, a tag to say it's incomplete or a test game etc. Also &quot;Sandpit&quot; will become a tag, which a moderator can apply to a game - so it will still be &quot;in&quot; the right category, even if it may be hidden by default. Not worked out all the details yet but that's the kind of thing I'm thinking of.",
