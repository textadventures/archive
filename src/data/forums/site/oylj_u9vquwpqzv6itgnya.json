For one thing, there are several features which these forums are currently missing.  GitHub Discussions would give us Q&A, polls, plus simple things like the ability to paste images into posts. The GitHub app supports Discussions, and means you'll be able to get things like push notifications for replies.\r\n\r\nSpam prevention should work better - I know it's frustrating at the moment on these forums, when posts are sometimes rejected for seemingly no reason, while genuine spam sometimes slips through.\r\n\r\nIt will also bring discussions closer to where the code is for Quest and Squiffy - it's easy to convert things between Discussions and Issues, for example.\r\n\r\nAnother big benefit - less work for me. I've recently come back to maintaining this website, and it will be a whole bunch of code I don't need to worry about. Why keep some old home-grown forum software up-to-date when a much better solution exists within a service we're using already?\r\n\r\nI've set up three GitHub Discussions areas to try out:\r\n\r\n- [Quest discussions](https://github.com/textadventures/quest/discussions)\r\n- [Squiffy discussions](https://github.com/textadventures/squiffy/discussions)\r\n- [textadventures.co.uk discussions](https://github.com/orgs/textadventures/discussions) (for discussions about the website itself)\r\n\r\nI will keep the current forums working as they are for a while. If we find there's a good reason, we can always abandon the plan to move over, but assuming we get along fine over there then eventually the current forums will become read-only. They will remain as an online archive, so all the existing conversations and knowledge will still be there and available.\r\n\r\nHope this works for everyone but please let me know your thoughts! Either here... or over there.",
