      "EditableText": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt appears that when new games become available, they are uploaded as a batch every few days.  Presumably this is because it takes work to add them to the web site but it means that often there are games that never get their moment on the main page under the Latest section.  The last batch was about 11 games and meant that one game wasn't even on the first page of latest games when you opened it.  Could you either have more Latest games on the main page or publish them more frequently so that there are only a few new ones at a time.  \r\n\r\nI am sure a lot of people would only choose a game from the main page.  Having spent a long time working on my game I know I would be disappointed if it was lost in a large update.  \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n",

The last batch of 22 games is the most I have seen when I have been checking during the last few months.  When there are that many then the 'see all' link next to 'Latest Games' doesn't show them all (only the first 18 I think it is).  I wasn't suggesting showing all new games on the main page but maybe add an extra row of them so that they get a bit longer on it  - how that would unbalance the main page I don't know and the coding required would be minimal.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how publishing games more often would have the opposite effect of allowing games a chance on the main page, they might only be there a day but would at least get a chance to shine.

      "EditableText": "> if there are up to 100 games a day being submitted, do a lot not get published on the site?\r\n\r\nMy exact quote was: \r\n>**Sometimes** there are more than 100 games submitted in just one day. \r\n\r\nOther times there may be no games submitted in one day.\r\n\r\nOther times, 100 games might be submitted, but half (or the majority (or sometimes all)) of them are placed into the dreaded Sandpit, where they will be slowly digested alive for 1,000 years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my points were:\r\n1.  Each new recent game knocks an older recent game off of the list.\r\n2. The number of games being submitted per second is directly proportional to the number of games which lose their place on the main page per second.\r\n3.  The moderators cannot be expected to regulate the number of games being published just to be sure each new game has its day in the spotlight.\r\n4. My guess is the chances of the site administrator editing the site's code to give new, mostly unpopular games even more space on the site's main page are slim to none.\r\n5.  If an author wants people to know his or her game is available, marketing is required.  Beta-testers are the best way to go, because they will help the author fine tune the game as well as help advertise by telling everyone how awesome the new game is.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> 'Latest Games' doesn't show them all (only the first 18 I think it is). I wasn't suggesting showing all new games on the main page but maybe add an extra row of them so that they get a bit longer on it - how that would unbalance the main page I don't know\r\n\r\nBut we are able to browse through 'Latest Games' from the most recent game to 210 games back.  There are 21 games on each page in the section (when using my desktop browser), and we can browse through 10 pages.  So, that's easy access to more than 200 of the most recent games.\r\n\r\nAlso, each game has cover art which has to load when a page is accessed, which I assume is why the site admin prefers to limit the number of games per page.  Otherwise, users would likely complain that the pages took too long to load when browsing through games.\r\n\r\n...and, as far as throwing the main page off balance, each section of games on the main page displays three games, except for the 'Latest Games' section, which currently shows six games in a desktop browser and . . .\r\n\r\nYou know what?  This one will boil down to one person's opinion versus another person's opinion, and I don't really care how the main page looks anyway (because I never visit it), so...  Meh.  There's no use in me wasting time trying to apply facts, reason, or logic to this one.  (NOTE:  My opinions admittedly suck.  I try to stick to facts, reason, and logic. Ha-ha-ha!)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the site administrator will agree with you and add a row of recent games.  Only time will tell.  I sincerely wish you the best of luck.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> I am not sure how publishing games more often would have the opposite effect of allowing games a chance on the main page, they might only be there a day but would at least get a chance to shine. \r\n\r\nI'm not following how you're not sure, but I explained how it works  (or how I believe it works) in the beginning of this post; so, I'm sure someone will point out any flaws or misinformation once this is posted (ha-ha!), and we'll all end up on the same page in the end.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> if the moderators are reviewing and publishing one game at a time why are they only published in batches?\r\n\r\nThat is a good question.\r\n\r\n...but how can you tell they are published in batches?\r\n\r\n---\r\n> Presumably someone else running the site has to update the web page periodically.\r\n\r\nI don't think so, because when XanMag says he's approved my games, they always show up immediately.  (XM is a mod, not the admin.)\r\n\r\nIf I hadn't experienced that more than once, I do admit that I'd be inclined to agree that you presumed correctly.  [Insert MANIACAL LAUGH #42]\r\n\r\n---\r\n> Maybe the moderators could rate the games and the order of new games could be decided by their ratings?\r\n\r\nXM explains how he does that in [the post just above this one](http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/site/topic/xl34alfmdugj90zaajgy_g/new-games-published-in-batches#60143c39-b595-4895-aa88-7e90b6f3a7b1 \"http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/site/topic/xl34alfmdugj90zaajgy_g/new-games-published-in-batches#60143c39-b595-4895-aa88-7e90b6f3a7b1\").  (XM is a pretty good guy, but don't tell him I said that!)\r\n\r\n---\r\n> just my suggestions as it seemed harsh on a game to be published and not even make the first page of 'show all latest games'.\r\n\r\nYou make a valid point, but, again, as far as the first page (or any individual page) is concerned, too many cover images will cause a page to load slowly.  Optimizing page load time is a high priority for most site administrators.  Fast-loading pages improve the user experience, and it's hard to provide an argument against that.",

I sincerely wish you the best of luck.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am not sure how publishing games more often would have the opposite effect of allowing games a chance on the main page, they might only be there a day but would at least get a chance to shine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not following how you're not sure, but I explained how it works  (or how I believe it works) in the beginning of this post; so, I'm sure someone will point out any flaws or misinformation once this is posted (ha-ha!), and we'll all end up on the same page in the end.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if the moderators are reviewing and publishing one game at a time why are they only published in batches?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is a good question.</p>\n<p>...but how can you tell they are published in batches?</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Presumably someone else running the site has to update the web page periodically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think so, because when XanMag says he's approved my games, they always show up immediately.  (XM is a mod, not the admin.)</p>\n<p>If I hadn't experienced that more than once, I do admit that I'd be inclined to agree that you presumed correctly.  [Insert MANIACAL LAUGH #42]</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe the moderators could rate the games and the order of new games could be decided by their ratings?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>XM explains how he does that in <a href=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/site/topic/xl34alfmdugj90zaajgy_g/new-games-published-in-batches#60143c39-b595-4895-aa88-7e90b6f3a7b1\" title=\"http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/site/topic/xl34alfmdugj90zaajgy_g/new-games-published-in-batches#60143c39-b595-4895-aa88-7e90b6f3a7b1\">the post just above this one</a>.  (XM is a pretty good guy, but don't tell him I said that!)</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>just my suggestions as it seemed harsh on a game to be published and not even make the first page of 'show all latest games'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You make a valid point, but, again, as far as the first page (or any individual page) is concerned, too many cover images will cause a page to load slowly.  Optimizing page load time is a high priority for most site administrators.  Fast-loading pages improve the user experience, and it's hard to provide an argument against that.</p>\n\n",
