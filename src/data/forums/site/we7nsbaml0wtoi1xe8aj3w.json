      "EditableText": "Hi. I'm totally with you and suggested it previously on forums. I, though, was hoping to promote Squiffy. Eventually, I want to push harder. Really, very few people understand how powerful of a tool Squiffy is (And, I guess Quest as well). I know the site managers think there really isn't much that can be done, but I don't think that is true. So, let's hang in there and keep these types of ideas flowing. I mean, also, why not keep Squiffy and Quest as open source but make revenue selling manuals to educational institutions on how students can use them (I have written one but haven't promoted it really or create games that are educational in nature and sell to teachers. There are so many ways to raise revenue to get advanced programmers to work on the site. How about sell to a company like Google with the idea that it has to remain open source as part of the deal? \r\n\r\nAnyway, if you believe in these products the way I do, keep writing.",

      "EditableText": "The main thing holding it back is just that IF in general is extremely niche and doesn't really have any money in it. Ad revenue barely keeps this site afloat, and I'm not even sure it's enough to be honest. There are no real active developers left other than The Pixie on QuestJS and even then it's just a timesink passion project. I can't imagine he makes any money from it in any way. Income to fund devs would help, but there's just not enough of us in the community to really make a difference, and it's hard to find anyone that's willing to volunteer the endless hours required to maintain a project that realistically barely has an audience to begin with. We all wish that wasn't the case, and we're all pretty passionate about IF to various degrees, but it's really hard to attract and retain people that don't simply move on in a year or so, and rightfully so.\r\n\r\nThere is probably a way forward, but I don't know what it is. We need passionate talent that is willing to sacrifice their own time for something they'll get very little out of, and that's something people need to decide on their own. The unfortunate thing is that even if we had funding there isn't much we could do with it. I don't think either The Pixie or Manowar actually have more time to dedicate even if they wanted to, and the few people in the community who have spoken up in interest tend to disappear that very week once they realize the monumental task they're offering to accept.\r\n\r\nSorry for getting a bit wordy. I'm 100% with you both here and I am not trying to discourage this conversation. I've been kicking around this community a little over 20 years and a mod for about half of that so I've seen a lot of history here. If there is a way to update the site and bring IF more into the mainstream or at least more relevant, I'd love to see it.",

      "EditableText": "Thank you Cryophile for your honest answer. It made a lot of sense. I do understand that this is a niche area. I believe the way to make it mainstream is through education. I've used Squiffy with so much success in the classroom as an English teacher. Now that I kind of see the issues, I'm going to try to promote the site through different avenues to see if those interested in it as an educational resource would be interested. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking about my 9th grade class playing the Epic of Gilgamesh game that I created with so much joy, trying to figure out how to win. Now, I'm remembering how each November, there is about 60 to 90 people who all of a sudden read an article I wrote that has a The Great Gatsby game I created attached to the article. I know that the only explanation is that a class must be reading the article and playing the game as part of an assignment. There is interest there. \r\n\r\nI also wish there were more honest conversations such as this one in which people think out loud. I will always truly believe that there is a way for this site to become more mainstream. ",
