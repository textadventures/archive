      "EditableText": "Hey folks :)\r\n\r\nI've just been going through the forums I frequent regularly, setting up ad campaigns for my new book. And I realise this place is the odd one out. Most places I'm active use *Project Wonderful* for ads, which means that anyone using the site can click an \"advertise here\" button next to the ad.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how the current ads running here (AdSense?) compare to PW. Obviously, it means I can't add this site to the list of places where my books are marketed; but I have no idea how it compares from the site's point of view. Is it something you've ever considered?\r\n\r\nThanks :p",

The site owner sets a minimum price, and if more than one person wants to advertise, it goes for the highest bid. If the high bid changes during a day, then you get billed for some fraction of the daily price.\r\nAdvertisers can search a list of sites, and look at a graph of what the high bid has been over the last month, and how many daily visits and unique visits there's been during that time.\r\n\r\n(Also, did you know this forum lets you put `>` at the start of a line, to indent the quoted message you're replying to?)",
