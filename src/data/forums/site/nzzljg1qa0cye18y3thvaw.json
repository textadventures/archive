They get stuck on a 'Loading...' screen.\r\n\r\nI've tried it on a number of devices and none of them work.\r\nI'd like to make a game using quest and host it here but I'm concerned if I can't try out and see how other games are working? I wonder if my game would suffer the same issue?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRach227",
