Java SE/SDK is used by some games platforms and it has to be present on your system for those games to work.\r\n\r\nBasically, free Java 8 updates for commercial customers, such as game developers, will cease in January 2019. After that date commercial customers must have a licence to continue to receive the updates.\r\n\r\nFree Java 8 updates for non-commercial uses, such as your home PC, will continue until the end of 2020.\r\n\r\nIn [this release from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html),  Oracle seems to be stating that they be relying more on the commercial developers, i.e. game developers, to distribute the updates to their clients.\r\n\r\nWhat if any affect will this have on future development of Quest?
