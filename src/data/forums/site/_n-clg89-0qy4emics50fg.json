For films or games, it seems a a good strategy to find reviewers you like and follow their suggestions...which in turn leads to creators whose other work can also be explored.</p>\n<p>I have no problem finding good games, and can also tell pretty quickly when I start a game whether it is worth continuing or not, so a difficulty score is of little use to me. When I'm in a game, however, I would like some indication of how far I am though it, as would be clear with a film or book, which helps explain my comment back in February. In playing a few games over the last year, those lasting an afternoon seem to be the most common and that could be a rough yardstick for scale or 'difficulty', which the creator could estimate and a reviewer confirm or refute.</p>\n\n",
