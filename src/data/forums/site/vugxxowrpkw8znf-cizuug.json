Or is it simply that the new forum is a whole lot worse than the old one?</p>\n<p>In the scheme of things, the forum changes affect me a lot less than most people here as I don't use Quest and I haven't played any Quest games in years, but the majority of people seem to view the changes as a bad thing. In this day and age, there's absolutely no reason why a forum has to be as bad as this.</p>\n\n",

Sure, okay. \r\n\r\nPost histories, quoting, things like seeing when a user was last online are all important. And without spoiler bars it's really difficult to discuss a specific game at all. But for me it's the loss of PMs that took the changes from frustrating to complete dealbreakers for continued use of the site. \r\n\r\nEven the PM system we used to have left a lot to be desired because lots of authors (the majority, really) didn't have forum accounts, meaning it was extremely hit or miss trying to actually communicate with them in detail about their game. I'd have to suggest in the comments of the most recent game in their profile that they come here and make an account, and just hope that they actually saw it in a timely manner and were also willing to take the extra step here to do it. \r\n\r\nSo I'd have been the first one cheering for the idea of combining the message boards and main site, but, disabling PMs altogether was such a baffling and self defeating way to go about it. I still don't understand the reasoning and I'd give anything for even just a normal forum stapled back to the site, now.  \r\n\r\nI used to give feedback and assistance to new authors pretty regularly and try to keep in contact with people like Xan and OurJud about their WIPs, and all that's just gone now. And I know I'm not the only one suffering from this because I've seen people so desperate to be able to discuss games they're flat out exchanging email addresses in the threads and opening themselves up to random spammers and scammers and who knows what.  \r\n\r\nLosing absolutely all of my collected thread links and code snippets was a major setback too, especially now that I'm so rusty and trying to relearn a lot of things I've forgotten. And it's not like I I can even do something as simple as browse through Pixie's post history to try and replace some of it. \r\n\r\nI'm getting back into writing in a major way now, but I've lost so much enthusiasm and motivation for ever writing a Quest game specifically it's hard to believe.  A community can't survive too long without...well, a community. It's already noticeably slower around this place. I want to talk to human beings one on one about the things we're creating, and be there for people I connect with to do proofreading, beta testing etc. when needed. All the things that got me excited about participating in sites like this in the first place.      \r\n\r\nSo obviously, I was very glad to see manowar's post and I hope something comes of that. I'd hope that a private messaging system would be recognized as important in any community...like I said, I still can't think of any without one. \r\n\r\nBecause I mean, failing that, my other suggestion would be just taking the entire community back to UseNet, lol. \r\n\r\n...thinking about it, the frustration's still there but that's at least one thing that makes this whole thing funny too. Mainstream IF spent forever in the stone age there before they finally crawled out onto the rest of the internet, and what was stripping out all reasons to have a message board over something like RAIF in the first place anything but deliberately uninventing the wheel? In TYOOL 2016, even. How quaint and IFish. :D \r\n\r\nAnyhow, that's my rant. Marzipan, whining pom, signing off.

I saw OurJud dropped in a little while back trying to find people the same way I did and was frustrated with many of the same issues. (I would have seen and clicked it immediately had the thread had the author's name on it, but alas, it was adrift in a faceless sea...) I still have no idea when the last time he actually logged in was and have no way to contact him. If he or any other old users return I'll also never have a way to know, unless I'm actively clicking on every single thread reading every single post.</p>\n<p>So put this down as a strong vote for for, yes, I would like a forum that behaves like a forum, and feel that a forum is essential to any forum-based community. I'm glad David made this thread in this section here where it's receiving attention and less likely to get lost.</p>\n<p>Also, 100% support for the suggestion of popping up a normal phpbb board until there's a chance to get around to addressing issues with this one.</p>\n\n",
