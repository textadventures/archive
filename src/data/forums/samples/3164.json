The restrictions are:\n1) It has to be a full screen draw.\n2) You can't vary the font style.\n\nNumber 1 is due to how it draws (you have to clear the screen each time to be able to update the same spot). The &quot;static text&quot; parameter allows you to continuously inject the previously &quot;trickled&quot; text. \n\nNumber 2 has two reasons. First, some format changes (e.g. font size) are done via script commands only. Support for this could be added to the code if there were a way to dynamically build scripts at runtime. I have not seen this ability. (I have worked out a way to do it, though, with string-based metascripts, but I haven't bothered to implement it yet.)\n\nThe second reason it doesn't work is that for the format changes (bold, italic, etc) which use tags, the tags trickle out as well, and you end up with disturbing yet entertaining results when only the start tag has been emitted but not the end one. I'm sure this is solvable as well, if the desire were there for someone to actually use it.\n\nAnyway, what I have typed here is probably more text than what's in the actual aslx file. But it's here now in case someone would like a simple &quot;text typing&quot; intro to their game.",
