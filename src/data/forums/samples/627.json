I have now decided to write a small adventure (15-20 rooms), I have sorted the plot and created the puzzles. But I am determined to do a good job. so before I can get realy stuck in.\n\nI have one big question. How do I creat a wandering NPC?\n\nI have had a look at some of the examples on the forums about following npcs, and had a peek the the manual. Any help would be appreaciated.\n\nSteve",

The rodent moved between the three rooms on his own. I was elated. How easy! It was turn-based, rather than timed, but this was SO ridiculously easy to set up (less than 15 minutes).  I wish it was that easy in Quest.  There should be a way to define a zone of rooms (I tried using a timer, and zone = 1, zone = 2 as properties) and then have the rat move across through the zone any which way, but then I got into the whole let's find the exits business and having to test for the zone property, and I'm not an ASL programming expert and don't want to become one, I'm all GUI and want to stay that way.   If it's that simple in Adrift to set up a wandering PC exclusively through its GUI, how great it'd be to be able to do so in Quest, so I guess this post is for two feature requests.  One, zones - think of them as a container of rooms, and then a way to create an npc, drop it in the zone, or point a movement property of the npc to the zone, and say ok buddy, start wandering.",
