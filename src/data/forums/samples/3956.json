You could even exclude revealing the exits from there too if desired.\nI'm not sure where in your functions you would implement this but I believe it can be done this way. You would probably need one test in the room descriptions before giving the exits (possibly before the IF [expression] i = game.autodescription_youcango )\nthe other would go in either (or both) of the ResolveName... functions.\n\nI haven't tested this though.",
