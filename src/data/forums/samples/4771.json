If you are asking about how to do something on the forums, chances are people will respond by posting the code, and if you have never seen code before you may be left wondering what you do with it.\n\nOnce you understand the basics, code is a lot easier to show on the forum, and far easier to copy from one place and paste into another.\n\n\n[b:3ff6r485][i:3ff6r485]Create a new function (commands are similar)[/i:3ff6r485][/b:3ff6r485]\n\nRight click in the left pane, and select add function. Give it the right name (same capititalisation, etc.). Bottom of the stuff on the right is Script. Click on the seventh icon (Code view). You should now get a text box below. Just paste the code into this box.\n\nClick on Code view again, and you should see the normal Quest view. If you see some red text, something has gone wrong. Check that you copy-and-pasted the whole code and nothing but the code (it could even be a mistake in the code).\n\nYou may need to set the return type or add parameters - see what the forum post says. To add a parameter, just click on the plus by the word &quot;Parameters&quot;.
