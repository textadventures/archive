      "EditableText": "Quest has a system built in for handling darkness, but it is not well documented (it was added relatively later, long after the tutorial was written). Here is a quick guide.\n\n\n[b:2dl67bcm][i:2dl67bcm]A Dark Room[/i:2dl67bcm][/b:2dl67bcm]\n\nThe first step is to go to the features tab of the game object and tick the box &quot;Lightness and darkness...&quot; (actually this is optional; it just turns the editor features on, your game will run the same either way).\n\nBy default rooms are light. We will create a dark room, called &quot;darkroom&quot;. Create the room as normal, make exits to and from it, and give is a description. Now go to the Light/Dark tab, and tick the Room is initially dark checkbox. A\n\nTry the game, and you will find two things. The first is that there is no default dark room description (I suspect this is a bug). The second is that you are trapped in the dark room - there is no way to use the exit if it is too dark to see it.\n\n\n[b:2dl67bcm][i:2dl67bcm]A Light from the Door[/i:2dl67bcm][/b:2dl67bcm]\n\nGo to the exit from this room, and on the Options tab, tick the this object is a light source box. In the drop down box that appears, set it to be weak. Now the player will see and be able to use this exit, even if the room is dark.\n\nGo back to the Light/Dark tab of the room, and add a description to display when dark. Perhaps: &quot;It is dark, but you can just make out an exit to the west.&quot; Now when you play the game the room is still dark, but the exit is useable, and the player will not be trapped here.\n\n\n[b:2dl67bcm][i:2dl67bcm]Weak and Strong[/i:2dl67bcm][/b:2dl67bcm]\n\nQuest has three levels of light for objects. None at all, weak and strong. A strong light will illuminate the whole room. A weak source only illuminates itself. The exit was a weak light source, so it could be seen in the dark room but nothing else could. What we need is a strong light source.\n\n\n[b:2dl67bcm][i:2dl67bcm]Implementing a Torch[/i:2dl67bcm][/b:2dl67bcm]\n\nCreate a new object, called torch. On the Inventory tab tick it so it can be taken. On the Features tab, tick Lightness and Darkness. Then on the Light/Dark tab, tick it as a light source and set it to be Strong.\n\nNow go in-game. With the torch in hand, your darkroom will be illuminated.\n\n\n[b:2dl67bcm][i:2dl67bcm]A Note about Containers[/i:2dl67bcm][/b:2dl67bcm]\n\nQuest has a sophisticated container system. If the player puts the torch in a container that is flagged as transparent, the torch will still illuminate the room.\n\n\n[b:2dl67bcm][i:2dl67bcm]Implementing a Light Switch[/i:2dl67bcm][/b:2dl67bcm]\n\nCreate an object, lightswitch, inside the dark room. On the Features tab, make it switchable. On the Switchable tab, make it Switchable, and fill in the message boxes. Then in the script to run when turned on, put in this (not sure what to do with code? See [url=http&#58;//forum&#46;textadventures&#46;co&#46;uk/viewtopic&#46;php?f=18&amp;t=4771:2dl67bcm]here[/url:2dl67bcm]):\n[code:2dl67bcm]darkroom&#46;dark=false[/code:2dl67bcm]\nFor the other script, you need this:\n[code:2dl67bcm]darkroom&#46;dark=true[/code:2dl67bcm]\nVery simple, they just alter the &quot;dark&quot; attribute of your dark room.\n\nIf you try it out, you will find the light switch now controls the darkness of the room (you will need the torch to find the switch, but then leave the torch elsewhere to confirm the room is now lit).\n\n\n[b:2dl67bcm][i:2dl67bcm]Implementing a Switchable Torch[/i:2dl67bcm][/b:2dl67bcm]\n\nWe should be able to turn the torch off, to save the battery. Pretty similar to before. On the torch object, first set it to not be a light source, as it is initially turned off (but keep it as a Strong light source!), then go to the Features tab, and make it switchable. On the Switchable tab, make it Switchable (the default messages are good enough). Then in the script to run when turned on, put in this:\n[code:2dl67bcm]this&#46;lightsource=true[/code:2dl67bcm]\nFor the other script, you need this:\n[code:2dl67bcm]this&#46;lightsource=false[/code:2dl67bcm]\n\n\n[b:2dl67bcm][i:2dl67bcm]A Torch that Fails[/i:2dl67bcm][/b:2dl67bcm]\n\nNo torch lasts forever; let us put a limit on this one. First create a new attribute for the torch, called &quot;battery&quot;. If working offline, you can do that by going to the Attributes tab to create it, and  Set it to be an integer, with a value of 5. If online, you have no Attributes tab, so go to the Script tab of the game object, and add this code:\n[code:2dl67bcm]torch&#46;battery = 5[/code:2dl67bcm]\nWe now need a turn script. We could do this two ways: have the turn script enabled and disabled when the torch is turned on and off, or have it running all the time, but only use the battery when turned on. I am going to do the former.\n\nCreate a turn script, and make sure it is under the Object object (i.e., it is vertically aligned with your rooms, not the stuff in the rooms). Give the turn script a name, torchturnscript, and paste in this code:\n[code:2dl67bcm]torch&#46;battery = torch&#46;battery - 1\nif (torch&#46;battery &lt; 1) {\n  torch&#46;switchedon = false\n  torch&#46;lightsource = false\n  DisableTurnScript (torchturnscript)\n  msg (&quot;You torch flickers and dies&#46;&quot;)\n}[/code:2dl67bcm]\nThe first line reduces the life of the battery. If it gets to zero the rest of the script kicks (I am checking for less than one rather than zero in case something odd happens, and it jumps to -1; I still want the torch to the fail then). Once the battery fails, we need the torch to be switched off, to not be a light source and for this turn script to stop. We also need a message to the player.\n\nNow we need to go back to the torch, and the scripts on the Switchable tab. The turn off script now looks like this, as we now want to turn off the turn script when the torch is off:\n[code:2dl67bcm]this&#46;lightsource = false\nDisableTurnScript (torchturnscript)[/code:2dl67bcm]\nThe turn on script is more complicated, as we have to test if the battery is dead.\n[code:2dl67bcm]if (this&#46;battery &gt; 0) {\n  this&#46;lightsource = true\n  EnableTurnScript (torchturnscript)\n}\nelse {\n  msg (&quot;No light - the battery is dead&#46;&quot;)\n  this&#46;switchedon = false\n}[/code:2dl67bcm]\nIf the battery is good, the torch becomes a light source, and the turn script goes on.\n\nIf the battery is dead, we need to turn the torch off again, and give a message. The turning on message will fire every time, that is just how Quest works, so the fail message needs to be crafted around that.\n\n\nWant to recharge the battery? Just set torch.battery.\n\n\nExample Game\n\n[code:2dl67bcm]&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;6&#46;5621&#46;18142--&gt;\n&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;game name=&quot;LightAndDark&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;gameid&gt;e525cf41-224a-48b9-b215-cffd1fb049e4&lt;/gameid&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2015&lt;/firstpublished&gt;\n    &lt;feature_lightdark /&gt;\n  &lt;/game&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;exit alias=&quot;east&quot; to=&quot;darkroom&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;eastdirection&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/exit&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;torch&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;switchable&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;take /&gt;\n      &lt;feature_lightdark /&gt;\n      &lt;lightsource type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/lightsource&gt;\n      &lt;lightstrength&gt;strong&lt;/lightstrength&gt;\n      &lt;feature_switchable /&gt;\n      &lt;onswitchoff type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n        this&#46;lightsource = false\n        DisableTurnScript (torchturnscript)\n      &lt;/onswitchoff&gt;\n      &lt;onswitchon type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;\n        if (this&#46;battery &gt; 0) {\n          this&#46;lightsource = true\n          EnableTurnScript (torchturnscript)\n        }\n        else {\n          msg (&quot;No light - the battery is dead&#46;&quot;)\n          this&#46;switchedon = false\n        }\n      &#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/onswitchon&gt;\n      &lt;battery type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;5&lt;/battery&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;object name=&quot;darkroom&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;dark /&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;This is a fine room&#46;&lt;/description&gt;\n    &lt;darkroomdescription&gt;It is dark, but you can just make out an exit to the west&#46;&lt;/darkroomdescription&gt;\n    &lt;exit alias=&quot;west&quot; to=&quot;room&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;westdirection&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;lightsource /&gt;\n      &lt;lightstrength&gt;weak&lt;/lightstrength&gt;\n    &lt;/exit&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;lightswitch&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;switchable&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;feature_switchable /&gt;\n      &lt;onswitchon type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n        darkroom&#46;dark = false\n      &lt;/onswitchon&gt;\n      &lt;onswitchoff type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n        darkroom&#46;dark = true\n      &lt;/onswitchoff&gt;\n      &lt;switchonmsg&gt;You turn on the light&#46;&lt;/switchonmsg&gt;\n      &lt;switchoffmsg&gt;You turn off the light&#46;&lt;/switchoffmsg&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n    &lt;object name=&quot;recharger&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;feature_usegive /&gt;\n      &lt;use type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;\n        if (torch&#46;parent = player or torch&#46;parent = this&#46;parent) {\n          torch&#46;battery = 5\n          msg (&quot;You recharge the torch&#46;&quot;)\n        }\n        else {\n          msg (&quot;Nothing to recharge here&#46;&quot;)\n        }\n      &lt;/use&gt;\n    &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;/object&gt;\n  &lt;turnscript name=&quot;torchturnscript&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;\n      torch&#46;battery = torch&#46;battery - 1\n      if (torch&#46;battery &lt; 1) {\n        torch&#46;switchedon = false\n        torch&#46;lightsource = false\n        DisableTurnScript (torchturnscript)\n        msg (&quot;You torch flickers and dies&#46;&quot;)\n      }\n    &#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;enabled type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/enabled&gt;\n  &lt;/turnscript&gt;\n&lt;/asl&gt;[/code:2dl67bcm]",

Just set torch.battery.<br/><br/><br/>Example Game<br/><br/><pre><code>&lt;!--Saved by Quest 5&#46;6&#46;5621&#46;18142--&gt;<br/>&lt;asl version=&quot;550&quot;&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;English&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;include ref=&quot;Core&#46;aslx&quot; /&gt;<br/>  &lt;game name=&quot;LightAndDark&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;gameid&gt;e525cf41-224a-48b9-b215-cffd1fb049e4&lt;/gameid&gt;<br/>    &lt;version&gt;1&#46;0&lt;/version&gt;<br/>    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2015&lt;/firstpublished&gt;<br/>    &lt;feature_lightdark /&gt;<br/>  &lt;/game&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;player&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_player&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;exit alias=&quot;east&quot; to=&quot;darkroom&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;eastdirection&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;/exit&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;torch&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;switchable&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;take /&gt;<br/>      &lt;feature_lightdark /&gt;<br/>      &lt;lightsource type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/lightsource&gt;<br/>      &lt;lightstrength&gt;strong&lt;/lightstrength&gt;<br/>      &lt;feature_switchable /&gt;<br/>      &lt;onswitchoff type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>        this&#46;lightsource = false<br/>        DisableTurnScript (torchturnscript)<br/>      &lt;/onswitchoff&gt;<br/>      &lt;onswitchon type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;<br/>        if (this&#46;battery &gt; 0) {<br/>          this&#46;lightsource = true<br/>          EnableTurnScript (torchturnscript)<br/>        }<br/>        else {<br/>          msg (&quot;No light - the battery is dead&#46;&quot;)<br/>          this&#46;switchedon = false<br/>        }<br/>      &#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/onswitchon&gt;<br/>      &lt;battery type=&quot;int&quot;&gt;5&lt;/battery&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;object name=&quot;darkroom&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_room&quot; /&gt;<br/>    &lt;dark /&gt;<br/>    &lt;description&gt;This is a fine room&#46;&lt;/description&gt;<br/>    &lt;darkroomdescription&gt;It is dark, but you can just make out an exit to the west&#46;&lt;/darkroomdescription&gt;<br/>    &lt;exit alias=&quot;west&quot; to=&quot;room&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;westdirection&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;lightsource /&gt;<br/>      &lt;lightstrength&gt;weak&lt;/lightstrength&gt;<br/>    &lt;/exit&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;lightswitch&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;switchable&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;feature_switchable /&gt;<br/>      &lt;onswitchon type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>        darkroom&#46;dark = false<br/>      &lt;/onswitchon&gt;<br/>      &lt;onswitchoff type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>        darkroom&#46;dark = true<br/>      &lt;/onswitchoff&gt;<br/>      &lt;switchonmsg&gt;You turn on the light&#46;&lt;/switchonmsg&gt;<br/>      &lt;switchoffmsg&gt;You turn off the light&#46;&lt;/switchoffmsg&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>    &lt;object name=&quot;recharger&quot;&gt;<br/>      &lt;inherit name=&quot;editor_object&quot; /&gt;<br/>      &lt;feature_usegive /&gt;<br/>      &lt;use type=&quot;script&quot;&gt;<br/>        if (torch&#46;parent = player or torch&#46;parent = this&#46;parent) {<br/>          torch&#46;battery = 5<br/>          msg (&quot;You recharge the torch&#46;&quot;)<br/>        }<br/>        else {<br/>          msg (&quot;Nothing to recharge here&#46;&quot;)<br/>        }<br/>      &lt;/use&gt;<br/>    &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;/object&gt;<br/>  &lt;turnscript name=&quot;torchturnscript&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;script&gt;&lt;!&#91;CDATA&#91;<br/>      torch&#46;battery = torch&#46;battery - 1<br/>      if (torch&#46;battery &lt; 1) {<br/>        torch&#46;switchedon = false<br/>        torch&#46;lightsource = false<br/>        DisableTurnScript (torchturnscript)<br/>        msg (&quot;You torch flickers and dies&#46;&quot;)<br/>      }<br/>    &#93;&#93;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>    &lt;enabled type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/enabled&gt;<br/>  &lt;/turnscript&gt;<br/>&lt;/asl&gt;</code></pre>",
