The other way is through the GUI~Editor (not helpful to you while you can't load into it due to code issues that need to be fixed), as at the top of the screen is a menu bar, and between its 'play' and 'help/?' buttons is a notepaper-like button, this notepaper like button is a toggle to go between GUI~Editor mode and Code View (your entire game code) mode. So, click on it, to go into Code View mode, to see/get at your entire game code. There's, I think similar notepaper-like buttons, also when you're adding a new script, which takes you into a code box, for typing in or editing that specific added new Script only, via code. So, just remember that the notepaper button at the top of the screen in the menu bar, is to see your entire game code, and the other notepaper-like buttons on your 'add new script' is just for editing the code just for that specific script.
