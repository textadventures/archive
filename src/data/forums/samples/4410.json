I downloaded and installed it and now the side panel is the ugly white default again. Everything is implemented like you said in your posts and it worked before, so this update must have screwed it up. The update was Quest 5.6.1 by the way. I'd really like to get this side panel working again if you can help. \n\nAlso I have a quick question, lets say I decided not to update, or i were to roll back to a previous version of quest. The theme should work for me again. But if I were to finish and upload the game, would the theme work for users who have the newer version of quest? I would think not, but if I could roll back and fix this problem for everyone that would be a very easy fix. (I cant remember if quest compiles the game like java code when you finish it, if it does compile the code, I should be able to compile my game in the old version and it would work for everyone right?)",
