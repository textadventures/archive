For example in my game there is a slot machine so when the player pulls the lever it should print  something like that :\n&quot;The reels are spinning&quot;\nwaiting 1 second\n&quot;The first reel stops and shows a cherry&quot;\nwaiting 1 second\n&quot;The second reel stops and shows another cherry&quot;\nwaiting 1 second\n&quot;The last reel stops and you see another cherry. YOU WIN&quot;\n\nor a telephone call:\n&quot;You dial a number&quot;\nwaiting 1 second\n&quot;tuuut&quot;\nwaiting 1 second\n&quot;tuuut&quot;\n&quot;Come on, take the call&quot;\n....\n\nSo solution number 1) is not helpful\n\nBut 2) is a good idea. I think I will add this for the next version",
