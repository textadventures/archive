I tried Safari, Firefox, and my mobile phone (Android), just for fun. Smooth.\r\nBut when playing the published game some of the images used for the background are not there, instead just the white background.\r\nThe images missing weight 104ko and 200ko,  while some working are heavier, so  it doesn't look like a size problem.\r\nMoreover all the sound works porperly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio files and image are in 2 directories (one directory \"sound\", one directory \"images\") situated in the main game directory.\r\nThey are linked properly, i checked.\r\nDoes someone has an idea how to fix this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
