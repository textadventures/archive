If most Newbies are preschoolers, I'm still in the NICU.\n\nI'm trying to make the player able to examine things, using passages for the examined objects/people. So far so good.\n\nOne of my passages is the person accompanying the player and I want the player to be able to 'examine' the companion on any screen. At first the passage wouldn't work at all, so I moved it down several lines so it would be below the two &quot;screens&quot; that allowed examination.\n\nBut only one would work. The other just comes up blank.\n\nI have it working by having the same passage (same name, same text) repeated in two places. But am I going to have to do that every time I want them to be able to look at their companion? I think the other game I tried making I think could use the same passage twice without having to input it twice. But that might have been a section that could be accessed from two different 'screens'.\n\nAny help? Or a push towards a site or wiki that can explain some of this? I have very, VERY minimal experience with html and as far as I know, none with coding. I'm doing this because a friend of mine was talking about how much fun she had playing text adventures so I'm making this for her. But I am having trouble with this and hoping I won't have to repeat the passage every single time I need it. (Other passages really need to be reusable too for that matter.)",
