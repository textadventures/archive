I could really do it with two lines but I'd like to do this clean and learn a new trick. So, how do you not() something?",

      "EditableText": "May be worth noting that javascript's `!`, `&&` and `||` are operators (like `+` and `*`). So you could shorten that line to:\r\n```\r\n    set(\"BoolA\", !get(\"BoolB\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Also, if you use ! on something that isn't a boolean, it will convert it to one first. The number zero, an empty string, or an empty list are considered to be false; and most other things are true (I think the string \"0\" might also be false, but not sure of the exact list. Because `!` always gives you a boolean, some programmers have found that `!!` is the quickest way to convert a number to a boolean)\r\n\r\n((random tangent; but I think that's a pretty interesting quirk of the language)",
