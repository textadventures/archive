This could be most of the answer I was looking for.  \r\nSo, if I get it right: this conditionally sets the JS variable \"greeting\" giving it the values \"good morning\" etc according to the value of the other js variable \"time\", right? they are not Squiffy values, right? this could be done also assigning a number value, or doing other maths, I assume.\r\nSo with JS you can have multiple \"elses\" into an IF statement. This means that if time < 10 it's \"good morning\", if it is >= 10 and < 20 it's \"day\", and if it's >=20 it's \"evening\". Right? \r\nBy the way,  one last question: how do I use JS to do other maths like increase, decrease, sum, subtract, multiply, divide and compare two values? I know it's a lot of questions, but that would close the circle and then I would be done.",

      "EditableText": "The problem you've got is that you are mixing structural elements with Javascript. As I mentioned in another post, in Squiffy Javascript MUST be kept separate from HTML and content. The main problems are as follows:\r\n\r\n- you  are specifying a body tag, when the outputted file already has one (you actually include a further body tag later on)\r\n- you have added script tags. These are technically HTML elements and will prevent code from triggering in Squiffy. They are not needed.\r\n- you've added content and HTML at the start, before any Javascript, so even without the script tags the code wont run.\r\n- you've included your Javascript as a function that you attempt to trigger using a body onload tag - because of the aforementioned problems this won't work, plus there is no need to do this anyway.\r\n- The way you are trying to output the variable is very convoluted.\r\n\r\nWhen using JS in Squiffy, always try and make use of both Javascript itself and the options Squiffy gives you to output content. The code you need is:\r\n\r\n    var greeting;\r\n    var time = 20\r\n    if (time < 10) {\r\n        greeting = \"Good morning\";\r\n    } else if (time < 20) {\r\n        greeting = \"Good day\";\r\n    } else {\r\n        greeting = \"Good evening\";\r\n    }\r\n    squiffy.set(\"squiffygreeting\", greeting);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    The output is: {squiffygreeting}\r\n\r\nIf you paste that into Squiffy and click run, it should work. You can then modify your time variable and see the different results.",
