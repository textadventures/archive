I'm working on a Squiffy game, and recently it started cutting me off at 831 lines—luckily I had my work saved offline, but even when I try to paste it back into the online editor it goes back to line 831 (which is always unfinished when I go back to it, by the way). Does anyone know why it does this or what I'd be able to do about it on a Mac rather than a PC?",
