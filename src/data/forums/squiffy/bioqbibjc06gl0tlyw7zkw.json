He also changes what he says every now and then depending on what you’ve seen and haven’t.\r\n\r\nAfter a certain point, it becomes a scavenger hunt where the character instructs you where to go and you have to remember what he’s talking about and go back to those places.\r\n\r\nIf you succeed, your taken into a short sort of interrogation/quiz based on what you’ve seen that only gives you a higher score if completed correctly. But after that, I programmed three endings: a good ending; another good ending; a bad/unsatisfying ending that crashes your game(this ending is harder to come across though, and if you find the path to it, you already know that continuing is going to end poorly).\r\n\r\nIt’s only in the last section that your choices are important so that the ending feels more victorious. And to top it all off, there is one choice in the early gameplay that everyone naturally makes (you don’t have to find all of the deaths to get to the next part of the game) that influences which ending you get. This makes the player feel like their choices actually mattered in getting their good ending. \r\n\r\nThe goal of my game was to find a way to end it in a satisfying way(wether it’s stopping in the early game or making it to the end), and I encourage you to see if I did so.\r\n\r\nSometimes the best thing to do is take limited ideas and squeeze as much creativity onto it. That’s how you create novel and exciting stuff.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",
