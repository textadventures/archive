Go to your page of games (click on your name in this thread). \r\n\r\n2.  Start your game.\r\n\r\n3.  When the game is loaded, at the opening page:\r\n     - right-click and \"Save Page as . . .\" to whichever directory you want.\r\n     - Be sure to save as type -- 'Web Page, complete'.\r\n\r\n4. Go to the directory where you saved it.  There will be an 'index' page - \"Gintama . . . .HTML\", and also a folder \"Gintama . . . .game_files.\"\r\n\r\n5. In the game files folder is all the content of your game.  The \"story.js\" file seems to be where all your squiffy code is: Load it into a text editor -- Scroll down to / find -- \"squiffy.story.sections\".\r\n\r\n6. I'm not sure, but I'm thinking you can just open up the Squiffy editor, then copy / paste from the \"squiffy.story.sections\" text to a new game in Squiffy -- that is . . . (a) Create a section / passage and (b) copy paste the code from the original \"story.js\" file.  Any other content / code (changes to CSS, etc.) should be in one of the original files as well.\r\n\r\n",
