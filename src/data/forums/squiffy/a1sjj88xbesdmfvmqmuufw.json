Without that, and with just a bigger font, the normal online version of Squiffy could be read pretty well on smartphones without using Phonegap.\r\nI know I would have to meddle with the Squiffy code, but it could be a very useful thing for everybody if our books could be read more easily on a phone. \r\nPlease don't tell me \"you need to be a programmer to do that\", I know that. If I were a programmer I would not even ask. If I were a programmer I would not even use Squiffy but create my own code. But with some clear instructions I think that even someone who is not a programmer could do just this single thing. I think that this is just the whole point about Squiffy, isn't it?",

In the exported game (choose Download->Export HTML and CSS from the editor) there's a file called style.css; look for the section marked ```div#squiffy-container```. You can set the value of the ```max-width``` property to whatever else you'd like, or else leave it out and set ```margin-left``` / ```margin-right``` instead. Hope this helps!",
