      "EditableText": "DISCLAIMER: I'm not sure it works the same in Squiffy, but this is how I do it in Quest.\r\n\r\n1. Create a 'STATS' page with all your text and variable outputs.  Add a link to the 'back' page.\r\n2. Create the page called 'back'.  Make it a non-visible page that runs just one script.  In Quest, it's the 'Move Player' script and I set it to 'expression' rather than to 'page'.  The expression lets me move the player object to an attribute called 'player.page'.  Here's the (Quest) code:\r\n```\r\n<object name=\"back\">\r\n      <inherit name=\"script\" />\r\n      <script type=\"script\">\r\n        MovePlayer (player.page)\r\n      </script>\r\n    </object>\r\n```\r\n3. In any page that you want to link to the 'STATS' page, you add the appropriate link and also add a script that stets the attribute 'player.page' to the current page name.  This stores the current player location.  Here's the (Quest) code:\r\n```\r\n  <script type=\"script\">\r\n        player.page = player.parent\r\n      </script>\r\n```\r\nThe reason you need the 'player.page' attribute is because the 'player.parent' attribute is hard coded (you cannot edit it) and it updates every time the 'player' object is moved to a new page.  The 'player.page' attribute stores the 'player.parent' data so that you can reference it when you go to the 'STATS' page.  This way, you can have a \"back\" link on your stats page that brings the player back to the previous page.  Just remember to set the attribute on **every** page that you want the player to link **from**.  In Quest, I just paste the script, so it's easy.\r\n ",
