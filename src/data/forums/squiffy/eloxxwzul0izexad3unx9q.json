      "EditableText": "So progress on my new game save is going swimmingly but I found myself stuck at one part of my code where I used an \"If seen\" to indicate that if the player opened a cabinet or not and if they can progress depending on what they did. The code was supposed to be if the player did not get the suit from the cabinet then they can not leave the room but if they do then they can leave the room. But when I put a story.go code within the If seen, it comes up as null and remains there instead of moving to the next section. I tried looking for other discussions to help and came up with a new code that also doesn't work.\r\n\r\nHere's the code that I have now:\r\n\r\n[two open doors]:\r\nif seen:SuitUp {\r\n        squiffy.story.go(\"Training\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDrake leaves through the two open doors, exiting the van and entering into the bright, yellow light from the outside world.}\r\n{else: <p style = \"color:orange\";><.b>Drake:</.b> I should get my suit on before leaving the van.}\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe else part works just fine, by the way, and the message after the story.go part comes up as well. But the story won't progress to the \"Training\" section.\r\n\r\nAnother small issue I have is, I don't know how to resize images. I changed the width and height (like another discussion said to do) but it either remains as small or remains as too large for the screen.\r\n\r\n(Using this image as an example)\r\n\r\n<.center><. img src=\"https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/batman/images/4/4b/Batman-the-telltale-series-logo-white.png/revision/latest?cb=20160920222933\"\"width:800px;height:300px;\"></.center>\r\n\r\nFor both issues, I'm making this game through the online site and not the download version.
