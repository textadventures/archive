Sometimes, I'd get an issue like it wouldn't show up as a preview/output unless I publish it privately but aside from that, I managed to get the \"story.go\" feature to work. I tried to do something similar with a timeout sequence (based on the other posts about timers that I checked out) but no such luck. I used the same code in a previous post that someone else made and added in my own section but, after five seconds had passed, the section didn't come up. My code looks like this:\r\n\r\n_Drake rushes over to the other side of the rooftop and sees a smaller, hunched over figure approaching the girl as she backs away from it._\r\n\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(function(){squiffy.story.go(\"Choice1\");}, 5000);\r\n    \r\n\r\n_[[Choice1]]:_\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong or is this feature not working right? CSS was also mentioned and I have no background in that, at all. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",
