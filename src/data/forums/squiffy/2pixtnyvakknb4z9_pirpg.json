      "EditableText": "Hallo.\r\nI found out that once a game is published, even as \"work in progress\", it is not possible to change its content or delete it. I  try to use the \"edit\" button in the \"My Games\" page after logging in, and it would open again the compiler, but the changes would not appear when I use the Publish button (even if I remember to Save before). Every time I hit Publish, it would always give me the original output.\r\n\r\nNow, I use to \"publish\" my games as work in progress because it is the only way to have other peole, who don't have installed Squiffy, to read what I'm writing and give me a feedback. It is quite important for me. But since the editing would not change the original output, I had to create a new file every time I have to edit even a semicomma. \r\n\r\n I would be perfectly fine with this solution, if I didn't find there's no way, as long as I can see, to delete a Published game once it's out. And again I would be quite Ok even with this, if I didn't find that in the Edit page, beside the Published section, all my games appear labelled like _[Squiffy]Untitled_ even if they have a name and all. \r\n\r\nSo it is becoming more and more difficult to find the right game in the Edit page, because I have to check first on the Published page, count which number is it form the top and find it this way in the Edit Page. Which is quite easy now that the games are less than 20 (actually, 10 each copies of the same 2 games) but it will become increasingly more complex in time. When the game I'm looking for will be number 2345 out of 45567 I would probably be unable to find it.\r\n\r\nNow that I'm using Squiffy, as a teacher, in a creative gamebook writing project with the kids, it becomes even more important to find a way to store their work and then modify it without having every time to create a new file, since there are 28 teams and we need to edit the work in progress once a week it's clear that the number of published files would escalate quickly and dramatically.\r\n\r\nSo, is there any solution to even just one of these issues? I need just one of these things to work differently and I would manage.\r\nThank you!",
