      "EditableText": "Look, not to sound like I'm gushing, but I cannot thank the people at text adventures.co.uk enough for this website. A few years ago I began writing a few games with Twine, Inform7, and even Powerpoint. My writers'  workshop students appreciated them, and those students who could program enjoyed writing their own. However, when I naively put my games on IFDB with full knowledge that they weren't very good, I got surprisingly insulting reviews even from one of the big wigs. That community certainly doesn't make getting help very easy. I stumbled onto text adventures.co.uk only a few months ago, and found Quest/Squiffy to be exactly what the Inform7/Twine gurus [i:3h77vad8][u:3h77vad8]think [/u:3h77vad8][/i:3h77vad8] they have accomplished. More importantly, I can ask a dumb question about how to do something, and get a kind and very helpful answer from the wonderful people at this forum! Thank you more than I can say.",
