Fast forward to today (19-Oct-2020).\r\n\r\nI actually had the urge to start a game and \"dusted off\" squiffy. I searched for some tutorials but found very little... Probably looking in the wrong places... lol\r\n\r\nThe tutorial by Carlos Pinto (from 2015) was still there, which I had downloaded in 2018, and watched it again. Very basic introduction to creating a basic game.\r\n\r\nCan someone point me in the right direction in how to design a game? Step-by-step would be ideal. But will settle for anything. eg: links to docs, vids etc\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nJ",
