If he enters a new section than he can looks at a MAP and can see all visited sections as little rectangles or something.\r\n\r\nThe number of shown sections should not be more then 10-15 sections around the players current position, because there are about 160 sections in that game. Player should only get a little orientation where he is. Somewhat like all sections „as far as you can see“.\r\n\r\nAnyone done that or something similar before?\r\n\r\nI‘ve thought of an array that would be displayed as a map, depending on which arrayelement is set („seen by player“).\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n",
