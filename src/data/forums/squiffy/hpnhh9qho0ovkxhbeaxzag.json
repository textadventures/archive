All is ok, except for one problem with adding an image as a background.\r\n\r\nFirst I add an image to the gamebook directly for my desktop. And when I make the app, the image was broken...So, I decided to upload the image to imgbb, and put the url in background like this:\r\n\r\nbackground: url(\"https://image.ibb.co/mWdGX5/Cellbackground.png\") left repeat;\r\n\r\nSo I tested in chrome my html and worked good! But when I make the app and test in my phone! I doesnt work! It only shows the modified background color which I changed. What can I do?\r\nAm i doing something wrong? Is there another way to achieve this? A way that dont include just change the background color?\r\n\r\nBest Regards!",

What else can I do? Is not important having a background in my game, but it would a lot of better to add some good atmosphere. The problem is the same: At the apk, the background doesnt show with the url! is there another way?\r\nBest regards!\r\n\r\nPD. PROBLEM SOLVED\r\nIt seems that phonegap have some kind of problems with urls. If you want some images in your apk, just put them in the root and rename the files in lower case.\r\n\r\nMy solution was this:\r\n\r\nbody\r\n{\r\n    background: url(\"cellbackground.png\");\r\n    background-repeat: repeat;\r\n    background-color:black;\r\n    color: white\r\n}\r\n\r\nThanks!",
