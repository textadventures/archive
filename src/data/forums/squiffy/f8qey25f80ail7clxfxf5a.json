      "EditableText": "Is it possible to do this? For context, I'm kinda struggling with some ideas, because I like Squiffy for it's coding aspect that allows for a \"Choose your own path\" style story, but I also want it to be heavily illustration based, as the theme of the stories I plan on writing is centered around the \"Anime chibi\" artstyle, if they were there own race of beings, so illustrations are pretty important to this story. I want to be able to also do a semi animated flip clip style story where you can flip through images, like one page being an eye closed, and then the next page being a quick flip to the eye opening. Basically to make it seem more fluid. As a result of this, I've been debating if maybe doing this story on google slides alone would be a good idea, or if I should just neglect that kind of stylistic choice and just stick with Squiffy, but if I can get the best of both worlds, that would be epic.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I have 2 questions.\r\n1. How would I go about inserting a link to a google slides project?\r\n2. How would that appear in a Squiffy story?",

I've never tried using Google Slides that runs automatically in a Squiffy game. However, I have run a google slides as an animation and then taped it to make it into an mp4.

They allow you to record five minutes for free.\r\n\r\nAlso, once it's turned into an mp4, you can put the mp4 on vimeo (it's free). Then, vimeo will easily guide you how to create code that will work in Squiffy so you can just copy and paste. It will run automatically. I've tried it.
